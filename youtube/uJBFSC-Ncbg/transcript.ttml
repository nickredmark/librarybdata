<p begin="00:00:52.540" end="00:00:58.989" style="s2">crisis and we need to now spend some</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.149" end="00:01:00.730" style="s2">time unpacking that and Chris Master</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.989" end="00:01:03.550" style="s2">Pietro is going to do is he&#39;s going to</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.259" end="00:01:08.619" style="s2">ology of the meaning crisis what are all</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.970" end="00:01:11.380" style="s2">the different ways in which we can see</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.619" end="00:01:16.600" style="s2">evidence for and understand the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.380" end="00:01:19.900" style="s2">crisis so welcome Chris and as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.600" end="00:01:21.700" style="s2">mentioned Chris is second author on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.900" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">zombie book we are currently working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.700" end="00:01:26.380" style="s2">the follow-up book called unsheltered</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:30.909" style="s2">but we want to talk now a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.380" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">about the symbol of the zombie and why</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.909" end="00:01:36.130" style="s2">it is our sort of current cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">mythological expression of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.130" end="00:01:41.770" style="s2">crisis so Chris what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:43.210" style="s2">the zombie in the mean crisis well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.770" end="00:01:45.070" style="s2">guess it&#39;s interesting the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.210" end="00:01:47.530" style="s2">question someone might have watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.070" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">this is why does ahhm be because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.530" end="00:01:51.579" style="s2">zombies are the subject of a fairly of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">multitude of different opinions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.579" end="00:01:55.930" style="s2">perspectives right there&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:57.220" style="s2">breadth of work that&#39;s been done already</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.930" end="00:01:58.750" style="s2">on this don&#39;t be some of it we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.220" end="00:02:00.549" style="s2">actually rolled in and included in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.750" end="00:02:02.200" style="s2">book right yeah that&#39;s right yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.549" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">done a little bit Jonathan pazzo who</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.200" end="00:02:06.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve had some oh yes discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:09.489" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s right so I&#39;m a zombie</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.700" end="00:02:11.860" style="s2">and zombies I would say especially since</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.489" end="00:02:14.590" style="s2">they came to rise through Romero&#39;s films</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.860" end="00:02:17.110" style="s2">have stood for a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.590" end="00:02:19.030" style="s2">kinds of symptoms and everyone has their</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.110" end="00:02:20.769" style="s2">own ideas about what they mean what</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.030" end="00:02:21.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried to do obviously in our book</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.769" end="00:02:26.569" style="s2">and what we&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.560" end="00:02:28.880" style="s2">again here is understand how the variety</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.569" end="00:02:31.270" style="s2">of symbols sorry the variety of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.880" end="00:02:34.910" style="s2">rather that are captured by the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.270" end="00:02:36.470" style="s2">our symbolization Zoar rather their anti</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.910" end="00:02:38.930" style="s2">symbolization as we&#39;ll get into what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.470" end="00:02:40.700" style="s2">mean by that pressure of the features</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.930" end="00:02:43.580" style="s2">that correspond to that crisis and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.700" end="00:02:47.900" style="s2">the mythos of the zombie the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.580" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">order that the zombie stands for threads</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.900" end="00:02:52.550" style="s2">together these symptoms and depicts a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">not only a creature but a world and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.550" end="00:02:58.160" style="s2">entire mythic dynamic and series of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:03:00.440" style="s2">patterns that stand for what you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.160" end="00:03:02.570" style="s2">call kind of human senescence or</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.440" end="00:03:04.550" style="s2">distension right the kind of breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.570" end="00:03:06.410" style="s2">of the agent arena ecology and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.550" end="00:03:08.330" style="s2">worldview with Tumen fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.410" end="00:03:11.660" style="s2">zombies are miss attunement right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.330" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">understand if we understand the positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">function of symbols as a way of tuning</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:17.300" style="s2">the self and tuning the sauce</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:19.310" style="s2">relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.300" end="00:03:20.989" style="s2">right then zombies fundamentally are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.310" end="00:03:22.819" style="s2">Mist attunement of that relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.989" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">that expresses itself as a decay of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.819" end="00:03:28.250" style="s2">ecology right and so that&#39;s gonna line</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">up then with the way the zombie symbol</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.250" end="00:03:33.110" style="s2">has sort of been magnetically attracted</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:34.549" style="s2">to the apocalypse symbol and we now</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.110" end="00:03:36.829" style="s2">they&#39;re often frequently paired together</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.549" end="00:03:39.350" style="s2">the idea of the zombie apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.829" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">that&#39;s right okay exactly so the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.350" end="00:03:43.850" style="s2">isn&#39;t just a creature it&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">entire world and fundamentally what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.850" end="00:03:46.910" style="s2">is moreover it&#39;s the relation between</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:48.320" style="s2">the creature and the world which is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.910" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">say it&#39;s the relation between the self</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.320" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">in the world so what I think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:54.380" style="s2">argue and try to explain is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:56.299" style="s2">zombie we refer to the zombie casually</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.380" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">as a symbol because it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.299" end="00:03:59.870" style="s2">simpler to do that right but what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:02.930" style="s2">really mean by the zombie is we mean a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.870" end="00:04:04.670" style="s2">kind of we mean a pattern of mythili we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.930" end="00:04:07.190" style="s2">need a mini we mean a consistent</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.670" end="00:04:08.630" style="s2">constellation of symbols right that all</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.190" end="00:04:10.100" style="s2">revolve around that creature in its</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.630" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">relationship with the world and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.100" end="00:04:15.230" style="s2">that relation that the positive function</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:17.329" style="s2">of the symbol is operative in its in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:19.190" style="s2">this case it&#39;s the negative function of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.329" end="00:04:20.750" style="s2">the deterioration of that symbol that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.190" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">want to focus on and talk about okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.750" end="00:04:23.900" style="s2">talk a little bit more about how you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.900" style="s2">want to use this notion of symbol I like</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.900" end="00:04:29.750" style="s2">this idea about the constellation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.900" end="00:04:31.159" style="s2">the tuning right so so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.750" end="00:04:32.539" style="s2">understand this properly what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.159" end="00:04:34.760" style="s2">actually need to do is we need to make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.539" end="00:04:40.040" style="s2">really really important</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.760" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">Station right and this is very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.040" end="00:04:44.630" style="s2">confuse right and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:46.790" style="s2">distinction between a sign and a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.630" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">this is Pierce&#39;s distinction well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.790" end="00:04:50.810" style="s2">Pierce&#39;s distant I don&#39;t want to claim</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:52.760" style="s2">it as Pierce&#39;s distinction I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.810" end="00:04:55.550" style="s2">to map that perfectly okay Pierce&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.760" end="00:04:58.100" style="s2">semiotic says very very complex and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.550" end="00:05:00.110" style="s2">there might be some alignment to it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.100" end="00:05:01.400" style="s2">fundamentally that&#39;s actually incidental</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:03.740" style="s2">it&#39;s just I should let everyone know</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.400" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">that Chris&#39;s academic background is in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.740" end="00:05:09.290" style="s2">semiotics so can&#39;t continue okay so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:11.000" style="s2">not actually invoking Persis semiotics</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.290" end="00:05:13.040" style="s2">by doing this I&#39;m going to make a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.000" end="00:05:14.780" style="s2">clear and simple distinction okay it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.040" end="00:05:18.290" style="s2">might have some overlap with first but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.780" end="00:05:20.660" style="s2">fundamentally what I&#39;m I&#39;m borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.290" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">much more from two people in particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.660" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">Paul Tillich all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:26.480" style="s2">obviously the theologian Paul Tillich I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say on the topic symbols</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.480" end="00:05:30.140" style="s2">especially sacred symbols yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:31.760" style="s2">and Carl Jung who also made this very</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.140" end="00:05:33.860" style="s2">careful distinction so you made an</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.760" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">observation that signs and symbols he</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.860" end="00:05:37.970" style="s2">used the term semiotic to mean sign I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">used the term semiotics to mean both</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.970" end="00:05:43.850" style="s2">right right but you made a claim that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.700" end="00:05:45.920" style="s2">the BA spec xual referent of a sign</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.850" end="00:05:48.140" style="s2">whereas that is greater than the sign</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.920" end="00:05:50.180" style="s2">itself right so the tree that the sign</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.140" end="00:05:52.910" style="s2">refers to is of a greater being let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.180" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">say then the word tree right right but</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.910" end="00:05:57.800" style="s2">that actually the symbol the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:59.780" style="s2">the the signification of a symbol the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.800" end="00:06:03.740" style="s2">meaning of the symbol is actually of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.780" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">greater being per se then the object</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.740" end="00:06:10.430" style="s2">that seems to represent the symbol right</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:12.590" style="s2">okay so the kiss is much greater in its</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.430" end="00:06:14.150" style="s2">signification than just the active right</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.590" end="00:06:15.110" style="s2">right just get into that example a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.150" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">little because that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.110" end="00:06:18.860" style="s2">cause you&#39;re also using this term not in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">the way it&#39;s used in my computer science</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:21.800" style="s2">just as a token that stands for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:24.140" style="s2">world that&#39;s right you&#39;re using it more</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.800" end="00:06:25.970" style="s2">the way it&#39;s used like in theology or in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.140" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">anthropology that&#39;s right okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.970" end="00:06:30.320" style="s2">right now I&#39;m not making an essential</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:32.450" style="s2">claim that this definition and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.320" end="00:06:34.820" style="s2">distinction has to apply in every case</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.450" end="00:06:38.050" style="s2">right I&#39;m simply framing the terms for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.820" end="00:06:38.050" style="s2">our use right right</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to say that signs and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.290" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">symbols actually do something very</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:49.320" style="s2">different what signs do is they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:51.450" style="s2">further right right word tree refers to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.320" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">tree fairly straightforward rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.450" end="00:06:54.750" style="s2">beyond semiotic ly it&#39;s a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">straightforward relationship they call</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.750" end="00:06:58.920" style="s2">it the signifier and signified in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:07:00.330" style="s2">semiotics that&#39;s what that&#39;s the old so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.920" end="00:07:02.760" style="s2">Sir Ian no it&#39;s not going to get into</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.330" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">that but I can just refer to it right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.760" end="00:07:09.720" style="s2">the symbol does something different it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">does refer but what it does is it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.720" end="00:07:18.810" style="s2">acts or it expresses look okay now this</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.420" end="00:07:20.670" style="s2">is something that Tillich really aptly</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.810" end="00:07:22.650" style="s2">identifies because what Tillich says is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.670" end="00:07:24.300" style="s2">yes the symbol refers to something but</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.650" end="00:07:26.550" style="s2">the symbol has a unique participatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.300" end="00:07:30.150" style="s2">quality right the symbol not only refers</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.550" end="00:07:30.840" style="s2">but it actually participates in what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.150" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">refers to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.840" end="00:07:34.050" style="s2">so symbols are nearly bound up then with</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:36.600" style="s2">participatory knowing that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.050" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">that&#39;s right so the symbol instances the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.600" end="00:07:41.070" style="s2">very phenomenon that it refers to right</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:44.370" style="s2">gestures - right Matt still excrete</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.070" end="00:07:46.320" style="s2">insight is that the symbol is to use a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.370" end="00:07:48.600" style="s2">term that you use off it&#39;s an enacted</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.320" end="00:07:50.210" style="s2">analogy right fundamentally it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.600" end="00:07:52.920" style="s2">participation which means that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.210" end="00:07:56.340" style="s2">phenomenologically it has a much much</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.920" end="00:07:59.310" style="s2">different effect than simply a reference</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.340" end="00:08:01.610" style="s2">okay it&#39;s not a referential tool we</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.310" end="00:08:04.320" style="s2">would call it rather more of a unenacted</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.610" end="00:08:06.060" style="s2">vessel okay right that&#39;s good so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.320" end="00:08:08.040" style="s2">idea is this this is going to really</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.060" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">lock you mostly towards propositional</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.040" end="00:08:11.760" style="s2">processing but this is going to be an</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:14.130" style="s2">Seadrill and purchases to do it I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.760" end="00:08:14.340" style="s2">respect ival okay okay that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.130" end="00:08:16.710" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.340" end="00:08:19.110" style="s2">okay so the idea is that the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.710" end="00:08:20.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just refer to a signified state</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.110" end="00:08:23.550" style="s2">but it actually actually it&#39;s the state</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.910" end="00:08:26.280" style="s2">and then crucially because it&#39;s a matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.550" end="00:08:29.070" style="s2">of identification we identify through</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.280" end="00:08:31.320" style="s2">the state price right so the symbol is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.070" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">vessel for identification because when</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.320" end="00:08:34.950" style="s2">we participate in a symbol what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">actually doing is we&#39;re momentarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.950" end="00:08:38.099" style="s2">becoming the symbol with our identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:39.840" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.099" end="00:08:41.550" style="s2">okay that&#39;s very interesting really</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.840" end="00:08:44.580" style="s2">important so especially before we saw</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.550" end="00:08:47.280" style="s2">the example of the kiss right so so when</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.580" end="00:08:48.960" style="s2">I&#39;m not just referring to love</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.280" end="00:08:51.480" style="s2">I&#39;m enacting it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.960" end="00:08:54.570" style="s2">I&#39;m also becoming a lover in the act of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.480" end="00:08:56.910" style="s2">kissing okay I got that I&#39;m expressing</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.570" end="00:09:00.420" style="s2">love and I&#39;m potentially also opening</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.910" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">myself to the experience of love perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.420" end="00:09:04.589" style="s2">to a depth that I hadn&#39;t before</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:07.770" style="s2">right right so what&#39;s what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.589" end="00:09:10.860" style="s2">sign or the semiotic equivalent of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.770" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">kiss we might say that yeah right part</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.860" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">the heart we know that that means love</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:17.850" style="s2">generally speaking but the kiss that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.660" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t participate no love the kiss</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:21.779" style="s2">actually participates in other instances</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.980" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">the phenomenon right so what are some</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.779" end="00:09:31.260" style="s2">other examples how about how about take</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:36.810" style="s2">a very different kind of example right</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.260" end="00:09:39.750" style="s2">the difference between a uniform as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.810" end="00:09:42.060" style="s2">sign of service right a sign of loyalty</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.750" end="00:09:45.480" style="s2">or service to one&#39;s country and a salute</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.060" end="00:09:48.060" style="s2">an actual gesture that analogizes an</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.480" end="00:09:49.800" style="s2">expression of belonging membership</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.060" end="00:09:51.510" style="s2">participation ticular identity you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.800" end="00:09:54.180" style="s2">assume if ticular identity but when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.510" end="00:09:56.310" style="s2">actually engage in the salute okay and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.180" end="00:09:58.140" style="s2">it&#39;s spatially referential - right</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.310" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">facility which is also what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.140" end="00:10:01.380" style="s2">particularly inactive let&#39;s take one</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.910" end="00:10:02.910" style="s2">let&#39;s take an example that I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.380" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">you use it which i think is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.910" end="00:10:10.140" style="s2">interesting it kind of goes with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:15.050" style="s2">kiss it&#39;s a wedding ring okay now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.140" end="00:10:17.160" style="s2">gonna make a tricky little argument here</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:19.110" style="s2">to say that a wedding ring actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.160" end="00:10:20.700" style="s2">falls into both categories right I put</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.110" end="00:10:23.220" style="s2">it right so I would say the difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.700" end="00:10:26.610" style="s2">between a wedding ring that&#39;s placed on</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.220" end="00:10:28.980" style="s2">display at peoples diamond store and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.610" end="00:10:30.810" style="s2">wedding ring that is worn actively is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.980" end="00:10:33.390" style="s2">the difference between a sign and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.810" end="00:10:35.459" style="s2">symbol the worn wedding ring actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.390" end="00:10:37.170" style="s2">instances the participation in it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.459" end="00:10:38.459" style="s2">because it changes my status and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.170" end="00:10:39.779" style="s2">actually makes me somebody that&#39;s bound</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.459" end="00:10:42.089" style="s2">to somewhere else where if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.779" end="00:10:44.459" style="s2">sitting there it merely signifies the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.089" end="00:10:48.360" style="s2">potential for marriage okay I get this</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.459" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">okay all right so I wondered also make</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.360" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna kind of leave the sign</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:52.709" style="s2">behind now okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.970" end="00:10:55.140" style="s2">suffice it to say for our purposes is</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.709" end="00:10:57.150" style="s2">very important not to make the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.140" end="00:10:58.920" style="s2">of identifying one with you yet so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.150" end="00:11:02.290" style="s2">want to argue primarily the zombies</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.920" end="00:11:03.999" style="s2">we&#39;re working in this domain right</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.290" end="00:11:05.739" style="s2">okay we&#39;re not talking about science</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.999" end="00:11:08.350" style="s2">interestingly and that&#39;s why Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.739" end="00:11:12.129" style="s2">has oh he calls his series the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.350" end="00:11:14.589" style="s2">world okay now interestingly this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.129" end="00:11:16.389" style="s2">bit of an aside but the it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.589" end="00:11:19.589" style="s2">important to contra distinguish sign and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.389" end="00:11:22.660" style="s2">symbol because I think erroneously</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.589" end="00:11:24.100" style="s2">they&#39;re conflated and I would probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.660" end="00:11:25.479" style="s2">make a side argument this is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.100" end="00:11:28.239" style="s2">other discussion for another day that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.479" end="00:11:30.009" style="s2">part of an entire dimension of semiotic</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.239" end="00:11:31.919" style="s2">switch is post-modernism or post</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.009" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">structuralism which is the semiotic</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.919" end="00:11:39.639" style="s2">expression of post-modernism arguably I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:42.279" style="s2">think languages over this ah erroneous I</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.639" end="00:11:44.199" style="s2">said I miss identity so is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.279" end="00:11:45.939" style="s2">possible is it both conflation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.199" end="00:11:47.829" style="s2">sometimes also equivocation I think so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.939" end="00:11:50.949" style="s2">okay that&#39;s interesting so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.829" end="00:11:52.269" style="s2">get we can get locked into especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.949" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">when it comes to identity and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.269" end="00:11:54.549" style="s2">identification we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:56.589" style="s2">this I think when we talk about modal</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.549" end="00:11:59.910" style="s2">confusion all right we can get locked</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.589" end="00:12:02.889" style="s2">into relating to ourselves as signs</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.910" end="00:12:05.049" style="s2">mm-hmm rather than as symbols we can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.889" end="00:12:07.029" style="s2">locked into understanding ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.049" end="00:12:08.919" style="s2">fixed referential entities would you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.029" end="00:12:11.739" style="s2">think that profiles on social media do</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.919" end="00:12:14.679" style="s2">right right right right to ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.739" end="00:12:16.509" style="s2">it assigns money to ourselves as fixed</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.679" end="00:12:19.629" style="s2">semiotic entities that are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.509" end="00:12:23.410" style="s2">objects in nature and so I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.629" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">lot of them a lot of the a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.410" end="00:12:26.619" style="s2">anguish that comes with</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:28.929" style="s2">self-identification and a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.619" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">post-modernism is responding to I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.929" end="00:12:36.999" style="s2">responding with a misdiagnosed framing</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:40.239" style="s2">is getting having identity improperly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.999" end="00:12:42.699" style="s2">bound up with something so this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.239" end="00:12:43.929" style="s2">confusion the semiotic confusion right</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.699" end="00:12:45.999" style="s2">is that it sounds like you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.929" end="00:12:48.159" style="s2">it&#39;s bound up with modal confusion - I</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.999" end="00:12:50.409" style="s2">think so okay that&#39;s interesting yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.159" end="00:12:52.629" style="s2">mean I&#39;m mapping this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.409" end="00:12:54.879" style="s2">crudely it&#39;s more texture than this but</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.629" end="00:12:56.559" style="s2">this would be something like getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.879" end="00:12:59.139" style="s2">locked in a having mode right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.559" end="00:13:01.989" style="s2">getting opened up to an opening to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.139" end="00:13:04.239" style="s2">being a being that&#39;s simplistic but</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.989" end="00:13:07.799" style="s2">generally I think that map&#39;s okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.239" end="00:13:09.909" style="s2">so if I can just proceed with one more</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.799" end="00:13:13.750" style="s2">characteristic of the symbol writ large</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.909" end="00:13:15.550" style="s2">right let&#39;s go to erase that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.750" end="00:13:17.410" style="s2">and this is something that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.550" end="00:13:19.390" style="s2">to talk about when you get to talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.410" end="00:13:21.610" style="s2">about relevance realization a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.390" end="00:13:24.670" style="s2">more so I&#39;m gonna gesture forward ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.610" end="00:13:25.810" style="s2">so slightly to some of the theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.670" end="00:13:30.370" style="s2">work that you&#39;re going to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.810" end="00:13:31.510" style="s2">about right is that symbols symbols by</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.370" end="00:13:34.270" style="s2">virtue of the fact that they exist</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.510" end="00:13:37.140" style="s2">liminal II between states they have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.270" end="00:13:40.570" style="s2">property that I&#39;m going to call</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.140" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">translucency right what on earth could</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.570" end="00:13:45.580" style="s2">this possibly mean excuse my terrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.730" end="00:13:47.050" style="s2">terrible there&#39;s some sense of that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.580" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">viewers have because we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.050" end="00:13:54.070" style="s2">transparency opacity shifting exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:58.870" style="s2">okay exactly so and this is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.070" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">understanding what the function of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.870" end="00:14:03.340" style="s2">symbol is to the phenomenology of how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:05.890" style="s2">relate to ourselves into the world right</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.340" end="00:14:09.210" style="s2">so that&#39;s perfect you&#39;ve already talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.890" end="00:14:11.700" style="s2">about transparency and opacity and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.210" end="00:14:13.870" style="s2">talked about how mindfulness involves</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.700" end="00:14:17.050" style="s2">transparency opacity shifting or any</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.870" end="00:14:22.570" style="s2">things like that okay so we can scale</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.050" end="00:14:24.730" style="s2">our identification at intervals along a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.570" end="00:14:28.570" style="s2">continuum right right be transparency</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.730" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">and opacity and what the symbol is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.570" end="00:14:34.810" style="s2">not something we look through it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.710" style="s2">something we look at we do both</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.810" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.710" end="00:14:41.320" style="s2">right we are the in symbols right yes we</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.300" style="s2">don&#39;t travel straight through them right</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.320" end="00:14:45.010" style="s2">you read right because of that top-down</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.300" end="00:14:46.990" style="s2">processing you read a paragraph you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.010" end="00:14:48.520" style="s2">not reading the words you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.990" end="00:14:52.120" style="s2">through the words completely right</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:54.400" style="s2">that&#39;s how we treat language opacity</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.120" end="00:14:55.840" style="s2">right your example with the glasses my</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.400" end="00:14:58.180" style="s2">glasses right I can look through my</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.840" end="00:15:00.040" style="s2">glasses with the symbol I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.180" end="00:15:01.390" style="s2">we&#39;re actually doing both of the C so</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.040" end="00:15:03.280" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at it but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.390" end="00:15:04.810" style="s2">looking through it and by means of it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.280" end="00:15:06.700" style="s2">something beyond it because of the way a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.810" end="00:15:09.390" style="s2">symbol represents a greater reality than</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.700" end="00:15:11.589" style="s2">itself exactly so there&#39;s a tension</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.390" end="00:15:16.450" style="s2">correct what you might call it opponent</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.589" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">tone all right there is a tone ass to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.450" end="00:15:20.380" style="s2">the translucency of a symbol now that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">also Maps on to another concept I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.380" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about you we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2">more with relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.980" end="00:15:27.300" style="s2">that&#39;s all right it down here trans</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:30.630" style="s2">ductility</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.300" end="00:15:32.670" style="s2">yes so we&#39;ll come back to with that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.630" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">basically is that right this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.670" end="00:15:36.600" style="s2">something that binds together</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:37.830" style="s2">subjectivity and objectivity and grounds</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.600" end="00:15:39.840" style="s2">the relation between them I know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.830" end="00:15:42.270" style="s2">was central until its idea of a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.840" end="00:15:44.790" style="s2">so one of the things telic was causally</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.270" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">arguing about is that theological</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.790" end="00:15:49.950" style="s2">symbols are terms that are meant to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">right point to the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.950" end="00:15:55.350" style="s2">relationship between subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:57.510" style="s2">objectivity exactly I see okay good so</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.350" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">let&#39;s do a little bit more mapping then</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.510" end="00:16:02.100" style="s2">William James among many other things</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">was one of the first many people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.100" end="00:16:08.010" style="s2">talked about this the pragmatists</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:09.270" style="s2">continues and so on but James was one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.010" end="00:16:11.580" style="s2">the first people to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.270" end="00:16:15.510" style="s2">tension between the eye and the me yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.580" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">that the individual as a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.510" end="00:16:20.490" style="s2">mechanism we are fundamentally this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:21.480" style="s2">an insight that gave the GAR among many</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.490" end="00:16:23.910" style="s2">other people had that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.480" end="00:16:26.910" style="s2">fundamentally relational yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.910" end="00:16:28.950" style="s2">that we subsist in a tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.910" end="00:16:32.210" style="s2">walk between possibility and necessity</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.950" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">for one thing between the I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.210" end="00:16:37.100" style="s2">talked about a little bit and being an</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:39.810" style="s2">object that we can then be hold treat</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.100" end="00:16:41.220" style="s2">address respond to it cetera well here</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.810" end="00:16:42.860" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about this for a sec</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.220" end="00:16:45.780" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s important okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.860" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">James Wright famously and what I will</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.780" end="00:16:49.530" style="s2">come back to this when we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">phenomenology of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.530" end="00:16:54.360" style="s2">and things like that but how this that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:56.400" style="s2">the self has this relationship to it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.360" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">me is that aspect of the self that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.400" end="00:17:01.080" style="s2">can render opaque it is what you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:03.930" style="s2">become aware of so I can stand back and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.080" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">reflect on myself and say John has these</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.930" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">properties etc etc that&#39;s me looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:13.860" style="s2">well that&#39;s me looking at me but to peek</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:15.390" style="s2">to speak more precisely and Dyckman</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.860" end="00:17:16.860" style="s2">talks about this in his book the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.390" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">observing self when he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.860" end="00:17:23.820" style="s2">mysticism there&#39;s always some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:27.420" style="s2">my processing that the eye that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.820" end="00:17:29.100" style="s2">looking out to me so there&#39;s that&#39;s John</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.420" end="00:17:31.500" style="s2">look at all of his characteristics but</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.100" end="00:17:33.660" style="s2">what&#39;s not included in the me is the eye</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.500" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">that is doing the observing right the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.660" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">observing self is never one with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:40.050" style="s2">observe self but they&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:41.140" style="s2">distinct things there&#39;s a weird non</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.050" end="00:17:43.330" style="s2">duality because</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.140" end="00:17:45.190" style="s2">that there is some kind of identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.330" end="00:17:46.600" style="s2">relationship between the me and the I</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.190" end="00:17:48.790" style="s2">know you can say but you can step back</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.600" end="00:17:49.809" style="s2">and look at that I yes I can I can step</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.790" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">back and look at it I can do a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.809" end="00:17:53.590" style="s2">transparency opacity shift I can become</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.950" style="s2">aware of that but then that&#39;s not the I</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:18:00.820" style="s2">that&#39;s now another me and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.950" end="00:18:02.620" style="s2">you can&#39;t ever right see the eye the eye</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.820" end="00:18:06.250" style="s2">is always that by which you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.620" end="00:18:08.820" style="s2">I&#39;ll use an analogy and it&#39;s also you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.250" end="00:18:13.419" style="s2">know hominem right I can&#39;t see my eyes I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.820" end="00:18:16.690" style="s2">can only see with my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.419" end="00:18:19.090" style="s2">you can only always the eye is always</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:20.950" style="s2">capable of observing the me but the eye</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.090" end="00:18:24.340" style="s2">is never itself observed and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.950" end="00:18:26.919" style="s2">always some important aspect of who and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.340" end="00:18:27.549" style="s2">what you are that is not captured in</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.919" end="00:18:30.850" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.549" end="00:18:33.070" style="s2">oppai opaque grasp you have on yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.850" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to this later about how</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.070" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">this renders an aspect of who and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">you are mysterious then the important</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:43.720" style="s2">point is logically ontological II in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">that sense these are not identical but</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.720" end="00:18:49.240" style="s2">of course they are bound together in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">your sense of identity and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.240" end="00:18:54.040" style="s2">makes you in inherently in tension as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.350" style="s2">identity is that a fair representation</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.040" end="00:18:58.929" style="s2">very fair more than fair yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.350" end="00:19:00.429" style="s2">perfect that&#39;s perfect and actually you</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.929" end="00:19:02.530" style="s2">know remember how we were saying a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.429" end="00:19:04.210" style="s2">moment ago that what symbols do</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.530" end="00:19:06.610" style="s2">fundamentally as they are they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.210" end="00:19:08.620" style="s2">mechanisms of tuning yes there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.610" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">great orchestral metaphor I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.620" end="00:19:11.890" style="s2">come back to in a minute because I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very act and it&#39;s very telling and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.890" end="00:19:15.549" style="s2">it didn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:17.140" style="s2">illustrative and it goes all the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.549" end="00:19:19.419" style="s2">back to Plato right this orchestral</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.140" end="00:19:21.910" style="s2">metaphor of harmony right harmonizing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.419" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">the Tigris Pythagoras that&#39;s right sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.910" end="00:19:25.830" style="s2">yes starts with the ferris and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:30.510" style="s2">Plato picks it up</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.830" end="00:19:33.130" style="s2">so the symbols have a tuning effect and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.510" end="00:19:34.750" style="s2">we become symbols as I said a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.130" end="00:19:37.179" style="s2">minutes ago with our entire arendelle</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.750" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">our identity and tyre becomes the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.179" end="00:19:40.510" style="s2">right such as our participatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:43.900" style="s2">interaction with it that we become it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.510" end="00:19:45.669" style="s2">but it becomes a vessel through which we</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.900" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">identify as we&#39;ve said so what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.669" end="00:19:50.290" style="s2">symbol then does right between and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:53.080" style="s2">would place the eye right here right I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.290" end="00:19:55.000" style="s2">and I&#39;ll place the me you are me right</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.080" end="00:19:58.660" style="s2">here what the symbol does</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:20:01.150" style="s2">is it triangulates right what the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.660" end="00:20:06.040" style="s2">does is it has a collapsing effect right</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.150" end="00:20:07.720" style="s2">these two these two valence iself these</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.040" end="00:20:09.790" style="s2">two different expressions of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.720" end="00:20:11.860" style="s2">relation are at opposite ends of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.790" end="00:20:13.930" style="s2">telescope and one that what the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.860" end="00:20:15.700" style="s2">does is it then collapses them in</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.930" end="00:20:18.490" style="s2">together right it creates a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.700" end="00:20:21.040" style="s2">non-duality an expression and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.490" end="00:20:22.660" style="s2">ones so the the symbol is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.040" end="00:20:24.730" style="s2">making an identity relation between</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.660" end="00:20:27.180" style="s2">things that are ultimately not logically</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.730" end="00:20:30.700" style="s2">identical because that is fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.180" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">selfhood and understanding selfhood is</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.700" end="00:20:35.230" style="s2">fundamental to understand participatory</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:40.120" style="s2">knowing okay good I got that excellent</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.230" end="00:20:42.520" style="s2">right exactly so to use that orchestral</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.120" end="00:20:46.270" style="s2">metaphor and it picks up a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.520" end="00:20:47.740" style="s2">the way it&#39;s play this sort of idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.270" end="00:20:51.310" style="s2">the part tights already talks about in</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.740" end="00:20:54.040" style="s2">the Republic is that you know if and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.310" end="00:20:55.870" style="s2">I&#39;m not making a metaphysical argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.040" end="00:20:57.070" style="s2">for the nature of the self or what it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.870" end="00:20:59.950" style="s2">I&#39;m just talking about a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.070" end="00:21:02.170" style="s2">understanding phenomenologically how we</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.950" end="00:21:07.060" style="s2">experience it and how its expressed sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.170" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">though I&#39;m doing I would do that both</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.060" end="00:21:10.780" style="s2">but if we were to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.190" end="00:21:12.520" style="s2">mechanism of the self and its</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.780" end="00:21:14.500" style="s2">self-organizing property as being</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.520" end="00:21:16.090" style="s2">comprised of instruments right imagine</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.500" end="00:21:18.610" style="s2">the self as a kind of orchestral</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.090" end="00:21:21.970" style="s2">expression and it&#39;s composed of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.610" end="00:21:24.850" style="s2">instruments and then the the the effect</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.970" end="00:21:26.380" style="s2">of the symbol is to introduce a melody</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.850" end="00:21:28.900" style="s2">to those instruments to actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.380" end="00:21:30.940" style="s2">harmonize them right in wordly intra</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.900" end="00:21:34.660" style="s2">psychically we might say in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.940" end="00:21:37.330" style="s2">harmonize them inter psychically extra</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.660" end="00:21:38.290" style="s2">second so but the tenor of I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.330" end="00:21:43.060" style="s2">Pythagoras that would have been the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.290" end="00:21:45.190" style="s2">tenor of the cosmos right so rusyn in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.060" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">his book on bearing witness to epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.190" end="00:21:49.450" style="s2">talks about the musicality of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:54.070" style="s2">intelligibility and something analogous</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.450" end="00:21:57.130" style="s2">to this was how I talked about how we</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.070" end="00:21:58.360" style="s2">become we become a temporal self</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.130" end="00:22:00.520" style="s2">temporarily extend it selves by</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.360" end="00:22:02.260" style="s2">internalizing narrative but also by</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.520" end="00:22:03.820" style="s2">finding ourselves participating in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.260" end="00:22:07.980" style="s2">narrative in the world and you get that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.820" end="00:22:10.410" style="s2">sort of identity across the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.980" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">me through the narrative okay so</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.410" end="00:22:16.410" style="s2">narrative melody the musicality of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:16.770" style="s2">mumait &#39;king sense of things okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.410" end="00:22:18.510" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.770" end="00:22:21.480" style="s2">so the point that we&#39;re taking about all</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.510" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">of this is right we have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.480" end="00:22:24.809" style="s2">all of this functionality of this symbol</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:26.370" style="s2">and we have to remember that when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.809" end="00:22:27.960" style="s2">talking about the zombie as a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.370" end="00:22:30.120" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about it as a sign</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.960" end="00:22:31.830" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it as this right</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.120" end="00:22:36.590" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.830" end="00:22:40.200" style="s2">it impacts people and our expresses the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.590" end="00:22:41.820" style="s2">the the participation in if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.200" end="00:22:43.290" style="s2">right word or at least maybe the anti</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.820" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">participation in the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.290" end="00:22:45.570" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:47.040" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s start should we start</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.570" end="00:22:52.140" style="s2">talking about some of the aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.040" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">zombie yeah so the zombie so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.140" end="00:22:55.110" style="s2">gonna do I think is we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:56.760" style="s2">about some discrete symbols</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.110" end="00:22:58.919" style="s2">mm-hm of the zombie right we said before</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.760" end="00:23:01.080" style="s2">the zombie is a mythic pattern right</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.919" end="00:23:02.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex of symbols it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.080" end="00:23:04.140" style="s2">one symbol sure sure so what we&#39;ll do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.730" end="00:23:06.179" style="s2">we&#39;ll go into a couple of the different</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.140" end="00:23:09.480" style="s2">symbols and show how they&#39;re ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.179" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">they&#39;re feeding into they&#39;re feeding</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.480" end="00:23:13.590" style="s2">into a relatively coherent and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:14.850" style="s2">consistent account of the symptomology</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.590" end="00:23:17.970" style="s2">that we&#39;re then going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.850" end="00:23:19.049" style="s2">later right okay so the first symbol we</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.970" end="00:23:20.340" style="s2">talked a little bit about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.049" end="00:23:21.570" style="s2">book but part of what we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.340" end="00:23:23.160" style="s2">now is elaborate on that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.570" end="00:23:24.390" style="s2">right I mean we&#39;ve done work since yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.160" end="00:23:33.330" style="s2">Chris and I have been doing some ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.390" end="00:23:34.620" style="s2">work documenting picture right and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.330" end="00:23:36.179" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get into this so the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.620" end="00:23:38.070" style="s2">symbol that we&#39;re going to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.179" end="00:23:39.750" style="s2">the symbol of the creature itself right</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.070" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">right not talking about the world now</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.750" end="00:23:42.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about the narrative the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:44.160" style="s2">meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.390" end="00:23:46.140" style="s2">right we&#39;re just talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.160" end="00:23:48.299" style="s2">monster and what are these some of the a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.140" end="00:23:50.760" style="s2">spectral properties that&#39;s a term that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.299" end="00:23:52.200" style="s2">Jonathan emphasized in his discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.760" end="00:23:57.059" style="s2">the zombie the way those zombies are</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.200" end="00:24:05.130" style="s2">monster right right and exactly did you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.059" end="00:24:07.020" style="s2">get something very similar when we picks</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.130" end="00:24:12.179" style="s2">up on the legacy of previous monsters</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.020" end="00:24:14.220" style="s2">but subverts yes it&#39;s not the mummy but</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.179" end="00:24:16.620" style="s2">the alien it&#39;s not the alien right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.220" end="00:24:17.940" style="s2">not the alien interloper yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.620" end="00:24:20.700" style="s2">something altogether different it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.940" end="00:24:21.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have you know we&#39;ll get there</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.700" end="00:24:23.460" style="s2">so okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.900" end="00:24:26.520" style="s2">first rain that we want to talk about we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.460" end="00:24:29.490" style="s2">want to talk about how zombies don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.520" end="00:24:31.820" style="s2">talk right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.490" end="00:24:34.890" style="s2">I have to pause it for a second because</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.820" end="00:24:37.560" style="s2">there are films so predominantly I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.890" end="00:24:41.310" style="s2">about and I think you&#39;ll agree we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.560" end="00:24:43.800" style="s2">taking our our feature list primarily</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.310" end="00:24:46.110" style="s2">from cinematic representations of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.800" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">zombies and and and those in television</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.110" end="00:24:50.610" style="s2">as well and some in certain canonical oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.100" style="s2">yeah I would say canonical ones the ones</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.610" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">that do variations on this only take</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.100" end="00:24:56.460" style="s2">precisely because the canonical ones are</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:58.260" style="s2">in existence exactly and at which point</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.460" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer zombie stories right</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.260" end="00:25:01.320" style="s2">right you take a genre you subvert it</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:03.450" style="s2">the point is that after you subvert a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.320" end="00:25:05.490" style="s2">genre it&#39;s no longer that genre anymore</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.450" end="00:25:07.830" style="s2">so there are a lot of more recent films</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.830" end="00:25:11.130" style="s2">but they depart from it very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.570" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">intentionally so what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.130" end="00:25:15.390" style="s2">about are the canonical depictions</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:18.660" style="s2">beginning with Romero right and and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.390" end="00:25:21.030" style="s2">lot of the branches that have reached</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.660" end="00:25:21.900" style="s2">beyond right so zombies don&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.030" end="00:25:24.690" style="s2">what does that mean they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.900" end="00:25:29.010" style="s2">unintelligible right and that means they</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.690" end="00:25:31.320" style="s2">lack what&#39;s fundamentally the chief</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.010" end="00:25:33.780" style="s2">axial inheritance of our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.320" end="00:25:36.560" style="s2">humaneness right our intelligibility our</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.780" end="00:25:39.270" style="s2">logos right fundamentally zombies lack</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.560" end="00:25:42.660" style="s2">they have they have no logos they have</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.270" end="00:25:44.460" style="s2">no mechanism of Co hearing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.660" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">and do any sense of identity right</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.460" end="00:25:47.730" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of the anti axial creature</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:50.040" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;re sort of literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.730" end="00:25:52.350" style="s2">falling apart also and really are there</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.040" end="00:25:55.470" style="s2">like coherence not exactly exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.350" end="00:25:58.500" style="s2">they don&#39;t talk and and they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.470" end="00:26:00.600" style="s2">can&#39;t they can&#39;t engage in any discourse</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.500" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">right and especially in the axial</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.600" end="00:26:05.610" style="s2">tradition discursively</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:07.590" style="s2">that&#39;s our mechanism for self correction</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.610" end="00:26:09.750" style="s2">right self reflection second-order</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.590" end="00:26:12.180" style="s2">thinking all of the mechanisms that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.750" end="00:26:17.160" style="s2">have to actually cohere and stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.180" end="00:26:19.980" style="s2">and transmute mature as as I as an</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.160" end="00:26:22.890" style="s2">identity as persons comes from this</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.980" end="00:26:27.180" style="s2">capacity so zombies from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.890" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">me like that right okay okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.180" end="00:26:35.040" style="s2">second one we want to talk about right</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:39.210" style="s2">there perversion of good Moni tests or</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.040" end="00:26:41.640" style="s2">culture both convinced relates to this</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.210" end="00:26:44.280" style="s2">one right yeah well communica communitas</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.640" end="00:26:46.710" style="s2">is the sense that sense of belonging to</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.280" end="00:26:48.630" style="s2">and with other people right as something</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.710" end="00:26:50.580" style="s2">you actively participated that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.630" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s not only the act of belonging</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.580" end="00:26:54.030" style="s2">with and identifying with other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.590" end="00:26:56.100" style="s2">but it&#39;s also actually being able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.030" end="00:26:57.870" style="s2">interject and internalize oh right</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.100" end="00:27:01.730" style="s2">wasn&#39;t able to create internalized</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.870" end="00:27:04.380" style="s2">models of other people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.730" end="00:27:05.580" style="s2">allow you and create the affordance for</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.380" end="00:27:07.470" style="s2">growth and transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.580" end="00:27:09.780" style="s2">fluctuation right all right so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.470" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">culture does it&#39;s not only a series of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.780" end="00:27:14.520" style="s2">linked minds problem-solving but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:18.870" style="s2">feeding in and feeding out and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.520" end="00:27:21.330" style="s2">actually allowing a an evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.870" end="00:27:22.920" style="s2">wisdom and attunement all right so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.330" end="00:27:24.780" style="s2">culture is doing is cultures growing</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.920" end="00:27:27.420" style="s2">together it&#39;s not just a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.780" end="00:27:29.040" style="s2">late no people have their theorists who</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.420" end="00:27:31.230" style="s2">talked about the ratcheting up effective</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.040" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">culture exactly right the concerted</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.230" end="00:27:34.530" style="s2">effect of culture is what&#39;s truly</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.510" style="s2">lacking here right because they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.530" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">communal in some sense they travel in</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.510" end="00:27:41.370" style="s2">packs and they have some nominal</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:42.930" style="s2">interaction but they&#39;re not coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.370" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">in any sense and they or not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.930" end="00:27:47.100" style="s2">producing out of it right so there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:47.640" style="s2">shambling horde rather than a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.100" end="00:27:51.090" style="s2">any kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.640" end="00:27:53.790" style="s2">exactly okay what&#39;s the third one they</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.090" end="00:27:55.170" style="s2">are untouchable so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.790" end="00:27:58.260" style="s2">interesting right and there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.170" end="00:28:00.360" style="s2">of different ways to well this points to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.260" end="00:28:02.460" style="s2">me for me to you know the real loss of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.360" end="00:28:04.410" style="s2">the axial legacy because this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.460" end="00:28:06.150" style="s2">loss of the contact epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.410" end="00:28:07.800" style="s2">really powerful resemble ours right a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.150" end="00:28:09.690" style="s2">loss of a sense of realized right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.800" end="00:28:12.090" style="s2">I mean we make all we talk about this in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.690" end="00:28:16.200" style="s2">the book a little bit we make all of our</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.090" end="00:28:18.390" style="s2">assertions of truth and parity with some</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.200" end="00:28:20.400" style="s2">kind of iteration of a judgment right</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.390" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">right you&#39;re talking about closeness in</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.400" end="00:28:24.600" style="s2">terms of touch we talk about the grasp</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:27.150" style="s2">ability of and ideating it&#39;s the ability</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.600" end="00:28:29.010" style="s2">of an idea and the plausibility we use</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.150" end="00:28:30.780" style="s2">being in touch with reality being in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.010" end="00:28:34.050" style="s2">touch with reality out of touch with</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.780" end="00:28:36.360" style="s2">reality right being close to someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.050" end="00:28:38.910" style="s2">having a hold on something right we use</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.360" end="00:28:41.880" style="s2">permutations of a touch metaphor to talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.910" end="00:28:43.860" style="s2">about to talk about intimacy and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.880" end="00:28:46.710" style="s2">talk about our sense of realness and our</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.860" end="00:28:48.740" style="s2">sense of comprehension of intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.710" end="00:28:50.600" style="s2">I mean you I grasp something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.740" end="00:28:54.200" style="s2">even comprehension comes from like comp</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.600" end="00:28:55.460" style="s2">rendre to you to to grasp to hold yes so</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.200" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">the fact that the zombie is untouchable</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.460" end="00:29:01.340" style="s2">is is actually exemplifying a loss of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:02.360" style="s2">all of that contact epistemology exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.340" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.360" end="00:29:08.150" style="s2">okay what&#39;s the third what&#39;s the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">one they&#39;re homeless right and so this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.150" end="00:29:16.790" style="s2">is something like the idea of Dom aside</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:18.920" style="s2">yes yes and the dumb aside and also as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.790" end="00:29:20.120" style="s2">decay of that agent during ecology right</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.920" end="00:29:22.220" style="s2">they don&#39;t belong anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.120" end="00:29:24.530" style="s2">right right all right so so they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:26.630" style="s2">embedded themselves into a world they</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.530" end="00:29:28.520" style="s2">don&#39;t belong to anything right they</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.630" end="00:29:31.390" style="s2">aren&#39;t coherent with their environment</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.520" end="00:29:35.059" style="s2">and so they&#39;re they they&#39;re Damas I</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.390" end="00:29:36.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t because they they have no sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.059" end="00:29:38.780" style="s2">of reciprocity with their environments</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.920" end="00:29:40.370" style="s2">right they have no pneumatic exchange we</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.780" end="00:29:42.380" style="s2">might say right there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.370" end="00:29:46.070" style="s2">breathing and there&#39;s no respiring with</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.380" end="00:29:49.280" style="s2">their environment so I mean the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.070" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">here is that they&#39;re homeless but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.280" end="00:29:53.570" style="s2">it&#39;s such a depraved version of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">homelessness that it&#39;s not like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.570" end="00:29:57.650" style="s2">any possibility of them ever returning</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">home that&#39;s right there and there and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.650" end="00:30:01.400" style="s2">that in that sense they&#39;re unlike the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:02.840" style="s2">other monsters in a lot of powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.400" end="00:30:08.420" style="s2">yeah I mean um other monsters actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.840" end="00:30:10.160" style="s2">have very stylized homes right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.420" end="00:30:12.290" style="s2">vampire rather has its you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.160" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">Kauffman and the weirdness has the lair</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.290" end="00:30:16.940" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re most most monsters</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.679" style="s2">actually are associated quite closely</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.940" end="00:30:20.630" style="s2">with a particular environment and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.679" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">either and the alien et either wants to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.630" end="00:30:24.590" style="s2">go home or the alien is coming here and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">trying to take our home from us right</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.590" end="00:30:28.070" style="s2">but it&#39;s still a home orientation like</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:29.150" style="s2">in one of the worlds or something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.070" end="00:30:31.370" style="s2">right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.150" end="00:30:35.420" style="s2">homelessness I think also incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.370" end="00:30:39.140" style="s2">is one of is one of the aspects of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.420" end="00:30:41.720" style="s2">zombie that that is very very evocative</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.140" end="00:30:44.030" style="s2">of nihilism right because we talked</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.720" end="00:30:46.610" style="s2">about this understanding nihilism is in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.030" end="00:30:50.090" style="s2">part a disinterest in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.610" end="00:30:52.040" style="s2">mm-hmm right a lack of connectivity a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.090" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">lack of involvement with the world right</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.040" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">a certain apathy and sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.610" style="s2">indifference of boredom right and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:00.710" style="s2">there&#39;s something almost bored of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.610" end="00:31:02.540" style="s2">zombies aren&#39;t aren&#39;t they can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.710" end="00:31:04.400" style="s2">enough of a perspective on anything too</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.540" end="00:31:06.350" style="s2">be bored right that&#39;s a different issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.400" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">but if they could they would be bored</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.350" end="00:31:13.330" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have any interest in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:13.330" style="s2">the environment all right all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.380" end="00:31:21.320" style="s2">they&#39;re insatiable right</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.860" end="00:31:22.550" style="s2">moreover what they do eat and these are</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.320" end="00:31:24.260" style="s2">kind of two different things but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.550" end="00:31:28.670" style="s2">bundling them together they eat brains</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.260" end="00:31:31.370" style="s2">yeah so what zombies are among other</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.670" end="00:31:36.410" style="s2">things then this is part of how they</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.460" end="00:32:57.170" style="s2">is really fundamental to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.500" end="00:32:59.030" style="s2">how an erotic instinct is transmuted and</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.610" end="00:33:06.890" style="s2">and and so they&#39;re zombies a perversion</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.790" end="00:33:09.920" style="s2">of all of that because the zombie the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.890" end="00:33:13.280" style="s2">zombies erotic instinct has no no no</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.920" end="00:33:16.070" style="s2">object in communitas right now so if</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.160" end="00:33:22.850" style="s2">constituting the zombie in some way like</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.290" end="00:33:25.040" style="s2">the zombie eats and they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.850" end="00:33:27.410" style="s2">satisfied so it&#39;s also an open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.040" end="00:33:29.270" style="s2">consumption very much like aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.410" end="00:33:31.610" style="s2">some of the criticisms people have of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.270" end="00:33:33.710" style="s2">like a market economy in which we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.610" end="00:33:35.930" style="s2">beset by the of the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.710" end="00:33:37.700" style="s2">that we just were uselessly and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.930" end="00:33:40.010" style="s2">endlessly consuming but we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.700" end="00:33:41.930" style="s2">satisfied right exactly and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.010" end="00:33:43.790" style="s2">and that&#39;s why especially after Romero I</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.930" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">think most people will say if you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.790" end="00:33:46.250" style="s2">to the average person and say what does</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:48.230" style="s2">the zombie mean they say oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.250" end="00:33:50.090" style="s2">consumerism right that&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.230" end="00:33:51.590" style="s2">irresponsible without realizing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.090" end="00:33:53.930" style="s2">depth of the meaning of consumerism</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.590" end="00:33:55.940" style="s2">right concern that&#39;s right it&#39;s ours</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.930" end="00:33:57.620" style="s2">once that would be well yes it is but</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.940" end="00:33:59.540" style="s2">that&#39;s this is part of schema that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.620" end="00:34:01.640" style="s2">that has much more breadth than just</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.540" end="00:34:03.230" style="s2">consumerism precisely in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.640" end="00:34:05.780" style="s2">you framed it so it&#39;s eating brains</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.230" end="00:34:08.420" style="s2">precisely because brains are that symbol</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.780" end="00:34:11.210" style="s2">they&#39;re the source intelligibility and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.420" end="00:34:13.250" style="s2">ability to make meaning so it hungers</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.210" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">it&#39;s insatiable hunger for the ability</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.250" end="00:34:17.720" style="s2">to make me the same thing happened and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:19.730" style="s2">what it&#39;s like a mind devouring mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.720" end="00:34:22.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something I think that gestures</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">in some sense to to a form of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.190" end="00:34:26.450" style="s2">perennial despair which always threatens</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:28.490" style="s2">to not itself right right or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:30.350" style="s2">there&#39;s something self-destructive about</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.490" end="00:34:32.060" style="s2">the zombie and what the zombie expresses</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.350" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s something sort of also I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.060" end="00:34:34.430" style="s2">and this is a cooker Guardian idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:36.920" style="s2">there&#39;s something about our</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.430" end="00:34:38.870" style="s2">self-consciousness that unknown that can</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.920" end="00:34:41.180" style="s2">it can can can go that way</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.870" end="00:34:44.630" style="s2">yes it&#39;s a perennial feature it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.180" end="00:34:46.370" style="s2">perennial possibility of the spirit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.630" end="00:34:48.310" style="s2">constantly in we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.370" end="00:34:51.860" style="s2">despairing and we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.310" end="00:34:54.890" style="s2">entangled in this in this tension and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.860" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why you know that&#39;s why being</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.890" end="00:35:00.260" style="s2">able to that&#39;s why the cultivation in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">this case Christian spirituality agave</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.260" end="00:35:05.510" style="s2">is so crucial because it takes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:08.540" style="s2">erotic instinct and again it cultivates</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.510" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">and transmutes it impregnated and allows</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.540" end="00:35:12.890" style="s2">it to become a vessel for creation in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:15.800" style="s2">this case the creation expressed by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.890" end="00:35:17.780" style="s2">idea of God so that that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.800" end="00:35:20.980" style="s2">undermines all of them all of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.780" end="00:35:25.160" style="s2">machinery really okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.980" end="00:35:28.580" style="s2">what&#39;s another ugly they&#39;re ugly yes by</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.160" end="00:35:29.720" style="s2">definition in fact right now again more</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.580" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">recent in</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:33.109" style="s2">senses of the zombie have tried to play</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:34.550" style="s2">with that a little bit they know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.109" end="00:35:37.070" style="s2">they&#39;re really cute cuddly they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.550" end="00:35:39.619" style="s2">right they&#39;re not and that actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.070" end="00:35:41.420" style="s2">again differentiates them from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.619" end="00:35:44.150" style="s2">other creatures right because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.420" end="00:35:45.500" style="s2">vampires are imbued with someone they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.150" end="00:35:47.450" style="s2">flushed with sex appeal</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.500" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">well literally since the belle of egusi</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.450" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">right and then and of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:53.810" style="s2">whole that dreadful Twilight series</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:56.270" style="s2">right they became incredibly sexy just</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.810" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">to be a vampire and and then in it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.270" end="00:36:00.200" style="s2">that saga was also doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:02.030" style="s2">with the werewolf making that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.200" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">werewolf something sexy and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.030" end="00:36:06.500" style="s2">right right whereas the zombie just does</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:08.210" style="s2">not know that you don&#39;t want to again</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.500" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">use players words for symposium you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.210" end="00:36:14.690" style="s2">don&#39;t want to give birth to beauty with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">the zombie yeah you know it it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.690" end="00:36:19.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an image it&#39;s or tuck goes</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:22.580" style="s2">along with the intimacy issue right yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.880" end="00:36:24.830" style="s2">it&#39;s completely it&#39;s inimical to any</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.580" end="00:36:27.380" style="s2">kind of substantial contact but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.830" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">also it&#39;s also a way of representing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.380" end="00:36:30.980" style="s2">zombies decadence in fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.740" style="s2">structural functional organization is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.980" end="00:36:35.240" style="s2">breaking down right that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.740" end="00:36:37.160" style="s2">right and it&#39;s a disruption of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.240" end="00:36:39.650" style="s2">cosmetic sensibilities right there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.160" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s no coherent cosmos within the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.650" end="00:36:45.530" style="s2">zombie right cosmetic obviously deriving</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:47.690" style="s2">from cosmos so fundamentally instance</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.530" end="00:36:51.050" style="s2">it&#39;s the apse it&#39;s also the absence of</p>

<p begin="00:36:51.050" end="00:36:56.599" style="s2">cosmic order right zombie right okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.839" end="00:36:57.710" style="s2">keep going this is excellent oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.599" end="00:36:59.780" style="s2">an interesting one this is one of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.710" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">favorites actually insofar as you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.780" end="00:37:07.310" style="s2">have a favorite horrible things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:07.880" style="s2">not evil right so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.310" end="00:37:11.089" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.880" end="00:37:13.609" style="s2">um because yeah we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.089" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of lack of malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.609" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">is something that really really forts us</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.280" end="00:37:19.250" style="s2">because it actually undermines our</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:21.140" style="s2">purchased on the phenomenon and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.250" end="00:37:24.109" style="s2">denies us the opportunity to arouse</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.140" end="00:37:26.599" style="s2">ourselves in defiance it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.109" end="00:37:28.849" style="s2">important to have that right it like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.599" end="00:37:31.130" style="s2">the espousal of virtue has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.849" end="00:37:34.580" style="s2">with the defiance of malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.130" end="00:37:36.440" style="s2">um as represented certainly in our inner</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.580" end="00:37:37.849" style="s2">great meta-narratives and as represented</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.440" end="00:37:40.310" style="s2">I think also in our day to day life</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.849" end="00:37:43.420" style="s2">right and so the zombie actually denies</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.310" end="00:37:45.880" style="s2">the survivors of the situation whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.420" end="00:37:48.369" style="s2">angling with the zombie the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.880" end="00:37:50.079" style="s2">denies them that there isn&#39;t any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.369" end="00:37:52.420" style="s2">moral superiority oh that says because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:53.890" style="s2">they write that the zombie wasn&#39;t evil</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.420" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">the zombie is not does not have</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.890" end="00:37:58.390" style="s2">mal-intent the zombies even less than an</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:38:00.579" style="s2">animal and some traits and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.390" end="00:38:02.140" style="s2">inspiring right that&#39;s not to kill it</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.579" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">zombie is not inspiring at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.140" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">perfunctory right there ya go</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:10.210" style="s2">there&#39;s no just feel great there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:13.210" style="s2">there&#39;s no great there&#39;s no great</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.210" end="00:38:15.160" style="s2">declaration of moral superiority right</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.210" end="00:38:17.740" style="s2">there&#39;s no great stand there&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.160" end="00:38:19.869" style="s2">it&#39;s so this is the opposite unlike</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.740" end="00:38:21.460" style="s2">empty gesture killing a zombie it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.869" end="00:38:22.630" style="s2">meaningless except in terms of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.460" end="00:38:23.799" style="s2">why you have to repeat it that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.630" end="00:38:26.559" style="s2">you have to keep repeating again and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.799" end="00:38:28.569" style="s2">again and again and again right so the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.559" end="00:38:31.329" style="s2">lack of that the absence of evil really</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.569" end="00:38:32.500" style="s2">it undermines that no but it also does</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.329" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">something else I want to stop here</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.500" end="00:38:36.490" style="s2">though it doesn&#39;t the absence of evil</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:38.380" style="s2">point to the fact that we&#39;ve lost that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.490" end="00:38:40.839" style="s2">yeah normative water and platonist right</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.380" end="00:38:43.930" style="s2">because the evil there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.839" end="00:38:46.210" style="s2">sort of metaphysical place for evil in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.930" end="00:38:48.700" style="s2">our cosmology no moral arbitration right</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.210" end="00:38:50.170" style="s2">right so exactly that&#39;s I was just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.700" end="00:38:52.170" style="s2">say the same thing that they also in</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.170" end="00:38:54.849" style="s2">addition to sort of within narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.170" end="00:38:56.920" style="s2">sorting the resistant you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.849" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">efforts of the survivors the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.920" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">evil is also representing the loss of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:03.490" style="s2">fundamental need or any framework right</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:06.190" style="s2">right okay that that we call the moral</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.490" end="00:39:09.400" style="s2">compass right our our ability to map and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.190" end="00:39:12.040" style="s2">chart right normativity and the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.400" end="00:39:14.799" style="s2">expresses the undermining of that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.040" end="00:39:16.569" style="s2">the disorientation of that right and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.799" end="00:39:18.609" style="s2">fact that they drift also points didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.569" end="00:39:20.380" style="s2">them not having a compass and things</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.609" end="00:39:22.540" style="s2">like that exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.380" end="00:39:26.349" style="s2">that&#39;s right and then another one I</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.540" end="00:39:28.420" style="s2">would add let&#39;s check here and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.349" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">actually not one that we talked about I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.420" end="00:39:34.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think in the book but the lilac</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:37.960" style="s2">perspective right and this is what draws</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.630" end="00:39:39.640" style="s2">the semiotic zombie into discourse with</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.960" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">the philosophical zombie right right</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.640" end="00:39:45.309" style="s2">right so let me just introduce this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:48.309" style="s2">issue of the philosophical zombie and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.309" end="00:39:50.500" style="s2">it&#39;s telling that it was natural to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.309" end="00:39:52.210" style="s2">philosophers and cognitive scientists to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.500" end="00:39:54.910" style="s2">use the zombie as a way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.210" end="00:39:56.349" style="s2">this so one of the issues of course and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.910" end="00:39:57.220" style="s2">we&#39;re going to but we bumped up against</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.349" end="00:39:59.730" style="s2">this we&#39;re going to bump up</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.220" end="00:40:02.500" style="s2">again is the issue of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.730" end="00:40:04.359" style="s2">one of the things that is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.500" end="00:40:06.490" style="s2">about consciousness is why you have it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.359" end="00:40:08.590" style="s2">and what does it do for you because</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.490" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">first of all most of your processing can</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.590" end="00:40:12.520" style="s2">be done unconsciously in fact most of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:14.470" style="s2">your processing is being done</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.520" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">unconsciously most of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.470" end="00:40:19.060" style="s2">so that I can speak to you is not any</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:21.090" style="s2">process of which I am introspectively</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.060" end="00:40:23.590" style="s2">aware my consciousness in no way</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.090" end="00:40:26.109" style="s2">penetrates to tell me what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:28.270" style="s2">such that I am being grammatical such</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.109" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">that I&#39;m an articulating etc all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.270" end="00:40:32.290" style="s2">things when I&#39;m remembering something I</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:36.940" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I do to remember I just</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.290" end="00:40:38.619" style="s2">remember what other end so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.940" end="00:40:42.070" style="s2">great difficulties is well what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.619" end="00:40:44.440" style="s2">consciousness for now let me explain a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.070" end="00:40:46.060" style="s2">phenomena for you to try and extend the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.440" end="00:40:49.900" style="s2">possibility of how much you could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.060" end="00:40:52.420" style="s2">unconscious and this is the phenomena of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.900" end="00:40:54.430" style="s2">blindsight by the way I recommend the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.420" end="00:40:55.900" style="s2">book by Peter Watts a science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.430" end="00:40:57.970" style="s2">book on blind sight it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.900" end="00:41:00.130" style="s2">great science fiction novels dealing</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.970" end="00:41:01.930" style="s2">with encountering aliens that actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.130" end="00:41:03.900" style="s2">did not present possess consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.930" end="00:41:07.089" style="s2">and what that might mean for us and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.900" end="00:41:09.730" style="s2">truly alien that would make them so</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.089" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">here&#39;s the phenomena of blind sight the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.730" end="00:41:14.020" style="s2">person has blind sight you bring them</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.869" style="s2">into a room and they are it&#39;s absolute</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.020" end="00:41:18.580" style="s2">sincere and so phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.869" end="00:41:21.670" style="s2">experientially they are blind they</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.580" end="00:41:23.080" style="s2">cannot see and there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.670" end="00:41:24.910" style="s2">reasons for believing that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.080" end="00:41:27.550" style="s2">absolute so they are not having what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.910" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">would call the experience of sight right</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.550" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">and and then what you could ask them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:32.830" style="s2">do is you can you bring them into a room</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:34.630" style="s2">and you say okay there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.830" end="00:41:36.210" style="s2">bottle somewhere in this room point to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.630" end="00:41:38.080" style="s2">it and they&#39;ll get angry or they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.210" end="00:41:40.210" style="s2">what are you doing you&#39;re being cruel</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.080" end="00:41:42.250" style="s2">and you&#39;d say just trust me</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.210" end="00:41:44.170" style="s2">you know point to it and and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.250" end="00:41:46.300" style="s2">okay I just I guess a bottle they&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.170" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">8.0 ball there&#39;s even been experiments</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.300" end="00:41:49.900" style="s2">where you can change the orientation of</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.690" style="s2">the object and they can guess the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.900" end="00:41:54.430" style="s2">orientation it can be that quite precise</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.690" end="00:41:56.680" style="s2">now here&#39;s the interesting possibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.430" end="00:41:59.050" style="s2">right so what&#39;s going on here is you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.680" end="00:42:02.290" style="s2">have what we might call a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.050" end="00:42:05.500" style="s2">intelligence of sight the ability to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.290" end="00:42:08.170" style="s2">know detect not experience I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.500" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">pull these apart but detect and pick up</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.170" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">and potentially interact with</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:14.950" style="s2">objects in a very efficacious manner</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:17.800" style="s2">without there being any experiential</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.950" end="00:42:19.570" style="s2">component to it so is that does that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.800" end="00:42:21.700" style="s2">make sense blind sight okay so now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.570" end="00:42:23.860" style="s2">consider that we have a creature that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.700" end="00:42:27.100" style="s2">had not only blind sight but deaf</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.860" end="00:42:28.360" style="s2">hearing and notice how that might strike</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.100" end="00:42:30.430" style="s2">you as a contradiction but it&#39;s no more</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.360" end="00:42:32.970" style="s2">of a contradiction than this right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.430" end="00:42:38.350" style="s2">that their ears can do all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.970" end="00:42:39.730" style="s2">detecting of you know air disruption but</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.350" end="00:42:47.020" style="s2">they have none of the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.730" end="00:42:51.420" style="s2">hearing they have numb touch right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.020" end="00:42:54.310" style="s2">there&#39;s none of the feeling of contact</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.420" end="00:42:56.220" style="s2">but nevertheless all the mechanics on</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.310" end="00:43:01.030" style="s2">all the intelligible interaction</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.220" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">interactions presumably now put these</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.030" end="00:43:06.310" style="s2">two together pay attention to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:07.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve been driving down the highway for</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.310" end="00:43:10.620" style="s2">the last fifteen minutes and you realize</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.690" end="00:43:13.900" style="s2">I haven&#39;t been paying attention at all</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.620" end="00:43:15.180" style="s2">right and in fact in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.900" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">literature people talk about this it</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.180" end="00:43:20.170" style="s2">yeah and people talk about this as your</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:23.070" style="s2">their inner zombie so do that they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.170" end="00:43:25.930" style="s2">there was something in them that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.070" end="00:43:27.700" style="s2">successfully driving but it was not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.930" end="00:43:30.120" style="s2">part of them that was having the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.700" end="00:43:32.530" style="s2">conscious experience so take that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.120" end="00:43:34.510" style="s2">capacity to have this intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.530" end="00:43:36.520" style="s2">interaction and then imagine that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.510" end="00:43:38.980" style="s2">creature has blind sight deaf hearing</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.520" end="00:43:42.300" style="s2">and numb touch so here&#39;s the thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.980" end="00:43:46.360" style="s2">experiment right I get a creature that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.300" end="00:43:50.260" style="s2">acts as well as you do they can move</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.360" end="00:43:53.050" style="s2">around the environment right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.260" end="00:43:55.300" style="s2">a completely sophisticated fashion it</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.050" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">could drive a car down a highway right</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.290" end="00:45:37.480" style="s2">gonna just going to remind everyone of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.140" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">this again all of this is one symbol</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.480" end="00:45:41.650" style="s2">right this is all the symbol of the</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.360" end="00:45:47.080" style="s2">thing about it is it&#39;s a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.890" end="00:45:52.360" style="s2">precisely because it triggers things in</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.080" end="00:45:55.660" style="s2">us we participate in as we all can feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.360" end="00:45:57.880" style="s2">a potential homicide we can walk down</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.660" end="00:46:00.220" style="s2">the streets of Toronto especially in</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.220" end="00:46:05.170" style="s2">around us and we are lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.260" end="00:46:09.450" style="s2">communitas we are insecure about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.170" end="00:46:13.510" style="s2">status of our consciousness we right we</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.450" end="00:46:16.570" style="s2">feel that we might be immersed in a</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.570" end="00:46:21.640" style="s2">worry about meaning hence the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.090" end="00:46:24.520" style="s2">credits all of this is being activated</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.640" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">in us and that&#39;s why of course some</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.520" end="00:46:28.810" style="s2">people in fact choose to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:32.020" style="s2">this symbol they go on zombie walks and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.810" end="00:46:35.980" style="s2">enact being zombies they do they do and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.020" end="00:46:37.580" style="s2">and they identify it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.980" end="00:46:39.860" style="s2">it&#39;s we took</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.580" end="00:46:44.990" style="s2">we said before that it&#39;s it&#39;s this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.860" end="00:46:46.850" style="s2">symbol insofar as it has it it extends</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.990" end="00:46:49.010" style="s2">to the function of symbol but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.850" end="00:46:51.320" style="s2">negative function right because it what</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.010" end="00:46:53.300" style="s2">the symbol the body of symbol if I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.320" end="00:46:53.990" style="s2">refer to the semiotic vessel of a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.300" end="00:46:56.060" style="s2">as a body</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.990" end="00:46:58.370" style="s2">right but the body of the symbol does is</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.060" end="00:47:01.400" style="s2">this actually delivers especially the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.370" end="00:47:02.840" style="s2">sacred symbols delivers the participant</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.400" end="00:47:04.490" style="s2">beyond the body of the symbol itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.840" end="00:47:07.160" style="s2">right it&#39;s part of a gesturing effect</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.490" end="00:47:08.810" style="s2">but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the translucency</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.160" end="00:47:11.980" style="s2">right it Usher&#39;s us through in forward</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.810" end="00:47:14.540" style="s2">what the zombie simple symbol does</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.980" end="00:47:16.070" style="s2">conversely the zombie symbols like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.540" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">ointment you get trapped in right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.070" end="00:47:20.420" style="s2">like a viscous film&#39;s body the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:22.100" style="s2">but the zombie doesn&#39;t take you any</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.420" end="00:47:24.590" style="s2">right so it&#39;s kind of an anti symbol in</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.100" end="00:47:26.090" style="s2">that that&#39;s why it&#39;s an anti so it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.590" end="00:47:28.580" style="s2">this is part of the decadence right it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.090" end="00:47:31.490" style="s2">actually is a symbol that is undermining</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.580" end="00:47:35.090" style="s2">symbolization that&#39;s right it&#39;s the miss</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.490" end="00:47:37.460" style="s2">the Miss attunement right right instead</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.090" end="00:47:40.310" style="s2">of tuning us again Co hearing our sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.460" end="00:47:42.980" style="s2">of identity to espouse that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.310" end="00:47:44.990" style="s2">transgender function to involve us to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.980" end="00:47:48.050" style="s2">afford our participation in the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.990" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">and are in our accession to new states</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.050" end="00:47:53.750" style="s2">of perspective what it does is it it</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:55.250" style="s2">traps us it prevents us from doing just</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.750" end="00:47:56.990" style="s2">that that&#39;s why it has that negative</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.250" end="00:48:00.560" style="s2">function that&#39;s why we&#39;re associating it</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.990" end="00:48:03.500" style="s2">with this now you know the expression of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.560" end="00:48:06.680" style="s2">going on a zombie walk are dressing up</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.500" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">as a zombie that and of itself is a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.680" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">interesting behavior and I think you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:14.510" style="s2">I are under understand that phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:16.550" style="s2">to be a kind of mostly unconscious in</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.510" end="00:48:18.410" style="s2">fact arguably it would have to be but</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.550" end="00:48:20.300" style="s2">that&#39;s a different argument I&#39;m mostly</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.410" end="00:48:23.150" style="s2">unconscious expression of this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.300" end="00:48:26.180" style="s2">yeah I think so at least what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.150" end="00:48:28.220" style="s2">gives you a moment of instead of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.180" end="00:48:31.490" style="s2">know nebulous disconnection you at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.220" end="00:48:32.300" style="s2">have connection to the crisis yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.490" end="00:48:33.380" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.300" end="00:48:35.090" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.380" end="00:48:36.740" style="s2">transitivity we&#39;re invoking the agent</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.090" end="00:48:38.900" style="s2">arena relationship why don&#39;t we move to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.740" end="00:48:42.200" style="s2">that part so now the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.900" end="00:48:44.690" style="s2">between the cinema right and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.200" end="00:48:47.150" style="s2">the zombie symbol which were originally</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.690" end="00:48:49.250" style="s2">was a separate symbol and the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.150" end="00:48:50.970" style="s2">which is magnetized towards each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.250" end="00:48:54.150" style="s2">right that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.970" end="00:48:55.860" style="s2">um so the zombie apocalypse is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.150" end="00:48:59.940" style="s2">interesting idea right that that has</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.860" end="00:49:01.950" style="s2">been contorted or distorted rather over</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.940" end="00:49:04.620" style="s2">time and now somehow it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.950" end="00:49:06.660" style="s2">synonymous with calamity right which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.620" end="00:49:07.650" style="s2">of course not the immunity the original</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.660" end="00:49:09.210" style="s2">meaning the original meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.650" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">revelation it&#39;s something like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.210" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">insight like you the world was framed in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:16.050" style="s2">one way and it&#39;s gonna be restructured</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:20.100" style="s2">and reveal a greater depth a better</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.050" end="00:49:22.620" style="s2">reality which is a kind of just like so</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.100" end="00:49:25.770" style="s2">again I&#39;m just saying this is one way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.620" end="00:49:27.840" style="s2">understanding I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m making this</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.770" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">disclaimer because I&#39;m gonna invoke the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.840" end="00:49:31.500" style="s2">symbol of Christ again that this is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">one aspect of that symbol so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.500" end="00:49:35.010" style="s2">mean to say this is a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:36.690" style="s2">account but because one way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.010" end="00:49:39.660" style="s2">understanding the symbol of Christ is as</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.690" end="00:49:42.570" style="s2">a symbol for a part tuition as a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.660" end="00:49:44.580" style="s2">for the the transmutation of eros into a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.570" end="00:49:46.350" style="s2">gabay the birth of the individual the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.580" end="00:49:48.540" style="s2">birth of the self into eternity you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.350" end="00:49:51.120" style="s2">heard something like that right and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.540" end="00:49:53.310" style="s2">zombie because it is because the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.120" end="00:49:54.870" style="s2">is a resurrected corpse the zombie is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.310" end="00:49:56.820" style="s2">resurrection without rebirth right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.870" end="00:49:58.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a perversion of that whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.820" end="00:50:01.820" style="s2">this but the same is also true of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.500" end="00:50:04.920" style="s2">world itself so we&#39;re just as the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.820" end="00:50:06.900" style="s2">perverts the red there resurrect the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.920" end="00:50:08.910" style="s2">rebirth of Christ the resurrection and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.900" end="00:50:12.330" style="s2">therefore the rebirth of the the rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.910" end="00:50:16.230" style="s2">of the V of the integrity of the south</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.330" end="00:50:18.990" style="s2">and tire it also does that it makes that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.230" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">same contortion with the world right</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.990" end="00:50:23.630" style="s2">because the world is a world is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.890" style="s2">resurrected after the apocalypse good</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.630" end="00:50:27.390" style="s2">when we say apocalypse what we really</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.890" end="00:50:29.310" style="s2">mean is post apocalyptic their zombie</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.390" end="00:50:31.860" style="s2">world is post apocalyptic right the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.310" end="00:50:33.780" style="s2">it&#39;s depicted especially in cinemas the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.860" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">calamity has happened this is now that</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.780" end="00:50:36.870" style="s2">the world looks like all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:38.940" style="s2">post-apocalyptic the post-apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.870" end="00:50:41.070" style="s2">world is a corpse just like the zombies</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.940" end="00:50:42.510" style="s2">right because nothing has been disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.070" end="00:50:44.760" style="s2">there&#39;s been nothing that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.510" end="00:50:47.670" style="s2">revealed that is gonna give a new basis</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.760" end="00:50:49.560" style="s2">for meaning it&#39;s nothing like the new</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.670" end="00:50:52.920" style="s2">heaven or the new earth at all right no</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.560" end="00:50:55.260" style="s2">no it&#39;s just a it&#39;s it&#39;s a scarce it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.920" end="00:50:57.300" style="s2">scarce place well emptiness and scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.260" end="00:50:59.220" style="s2">and fill the zombies and oh yeah scarce</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.300" end="00:51:04.650" style="s2">except for the presence of constant yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.220" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">constant horror but so the same the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.650" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">the same corruption that the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">mythos has administered to the symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:15.930" style="s2">Christ as a symbol for the self which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:18.420" style="s2">I to believe saying a symbol for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.930" end="00:51:21.300" style="s2">process of symbolizing but for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.420" end="00:51:23.130" style="s2">process of introjection Buhl&#39;s and using</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.300" end="00:51:25.110" style="s2">them to scale and transmute and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.130" end="00:51:26.850" style="s2">reconfigure our identification right</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.110" end="00:51:28.770" style="s2">current all of that is bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.850" end="00:51:31.140" style="s2">that symbol really really powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.770" end="00:51:34.020" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s I mean that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.140" end="00:51:36.060" style="s2">why it is as deeply deeply part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.020" end="00:51:38.340" style="s2">fundamental growth still is all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.060" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">even in even arguably in something of an</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.340" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">afterglow right um but the zombie has</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:47.070" style="s2">that same effect the zombie myth lesson</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:47.790" style="s2">administers that same corruption right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.070" end="00:51:49.590" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.790" end="00:51:52.140" style="s2">so what we see is these two symbols</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.590" end="00:51:54.540" style="s2">right the symbol is being perverted</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.140" end="00:51:56.520" style="s2">right into the zombie and then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.540" end="00:51:59.370" style="s2">symbol of the apocalypse is being in</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.520" end="00:52:01.650" style="s2">perverted and then these two now belong</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.370" end="00:52:03.630" style="s2">together in the way in which the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.650" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">approximating a cohabitation wait what</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.630" end="00:52:07.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t really call have no right</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:09.090" style="s2">there&#39;s the zombies homeless right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.050" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">right they just happen to be there so</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.090" end="00:52:11.790" style="s2">they uh they&#39;re disconnected they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:13.770" style="s2">unglued from one of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.790" end="00:52:16.080" style="s2">yeah so they rep they represent there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.770" end="00:52:17.850" style="s2">no exchange right there is no agent</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.080" end="00:52:19.620" style="s2">arena relationship here but what there</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.850" end="00:52:21.840" style="s2">is is there&#39;s a sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.620" end="00:52:23.010" style="s2">calamitous slamming together of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.840" end="00:52:24.750" style="s2">right that&#39;s right that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.010" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">why it&#39;s an anti ecology right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.750" end="00:52:26.940" style="s2">there is nothing reciprocal in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:28.920" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.940" end="00:52:30.690" style="s2">they don&#39;t perspire keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.920" end="00:52:33.300" style="s2">this idea of respiration which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.690" end="00:52:35.910" style="s2">something that so be the pollution of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.300" end="00:52:37.830" style="s2">the atmosphere right so costano</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.910" end="00:52:40.620" style="s2">invokes that a little bit Kierkegaard</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.830" end="00:52:42.260" style="s2">way back and talked about the despair of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.620" end="00:52:46.350" style="s2">the self as being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.260" end="00:52:49.290" style="s2">hyperventilation asphyxiating yep</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.350" end="00:52:51.930" style="s2">sensation not being able to get a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.290" end="00:52:54.150" style="s2">purchase on the world is is analogized</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.930" end="00:52:55.770" style="s2">by essentially not being able to believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.150" end="00:52:58.050" style="s2">in the world and have the world grieve</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.770" end="00:53:00.180" style="s2">you right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.050" end="00:53:01.860" style="s2">so they so the apocalypse in the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.180" end="00:53:04.320" style="s2">have found each other because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.860" end="00:53:05.640" style="s2">the perversion of the rebirth of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.320" end="00:53:08.910" style="s2">world and the perversion of the rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.640" end="00:53:10.890" style="s2">of the south all right now and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.910" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">there&#39;s even another way in which this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.890" end="00:53:14.910" style="s2">is symbolizing the meaning crisis right</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:17.400" style="s2">so of course the the that apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.910" end="00:53:18.520" style="s2">points to our disconnectedness from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.400" end="00:53:21.340" style="s2">world but also the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.520" end="00:53:23.230" style="s2">being threat of the biological ecology</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.340" end="00:53:24.820" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got both the undermining of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.230" end="00:53:27.310" style="s2">what we might call the existential</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.820" end="00:53:30.070" style="s2">ecology and the biological ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.310" end="00:53:32.110" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of reinforcing each</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.070" end="00:53:34.600" style="s2">other but also the whole thing this</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.110" end="00:53:36.670" style="s2">whole package also symbolizes the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.600" end="00:53:38.410" style="s2">meaning crisis this point about the sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.670" end="00:53:40.840" style="s2">of the meta-narrative yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.410" end="00:53:43.120" style="s2">meta-narrative too because you know when</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.840" end="00:53:45.610" style="s2">we it has to do with the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.120" end="00:53:48.940" style="s2">viewer or the reader or whatever the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.610" end="00:53:52.300" style="s2">person who&#39;s who&#39;s who&#39;s in whose party</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.940" end="00:53:54.100" style="s2">to the story right from without the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.300" end="00:53:55.750" style="s2">that they relate to the story so not</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.100" end="00:53:57.370" style="s2">only the characters within the fictional</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.750" end="00:54:00.280" style="s2">story but how we relate to how we relate</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.370" end="00:54:03.100" style="s2">so the yeah so the idea here is right we</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.280" end="00:54:05.110" style="s2">got like typically although we we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.100" end="00:54:06.700" style="s2">this weird thing right and movies are</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.110" end="00:54:08.140" style="s2">great for this idea of translucency I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.700" end="00:54:10.120" style="s2">identifying with the characters but</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.140" end="00:54:12.220" style="s2">there&#39;s often dramatic irony I often</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.120" end="00:54:15.760" style="s2">possess knowledge right well this is how</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.220" end="00:54:17.170" style="s2">you deal with the vampire I know this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.760" end="00:54:20.650" style="s2">common I know this is coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.170" end="00:54:21.940" style="s2">nowhere to be yeah yes right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.650" end="00:54:23.620" style="s2">a kind of self transcendence in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.940" end="00:54:25.750" style="s2">dramatic irony yeah that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.620" end="00:54:28.420" style="s2">locked in because because the situation</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.750" end="00:54:30.460" style="s2">is an archetype we recognizable right we</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.420" end="00:54:32.440" style="s2">don&#39;t look into it and instinctively</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.460" end="00:54:34.270" style="s2">know it and recognize that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.440" end="00:54:34.750" style="s2">can&#39;t interpose ourselves right right</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.270" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.750" end="00:54:38.170" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t intervene in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:40.690" style="s2">productive way that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.170" end="00:54:42.580" style="s2">problem right and and where were we to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.690" end="00:54:44.470" style="s2">interpose results we wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.580" end="00:54:46.540" style="s2">extract any wisdom from it either so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.470" end="00:54:48.040" style="s2">there&#39;s also no reciprocity between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.540" end="00:54:49.990" style="s2">person that&#39;s party to the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.040" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">from without and the narrative itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.990" end="00:54:54.670" style="s2">and because it&#39;s unrecognizable to us</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:56.890" style="s2">and because it doesn&#39;t seem to tend in</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.670" end="00:54:59.560" style="s2">any given direction right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.890" end="00:55:01.930" style="s2">it&#39;s the directionality of the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.560" end="00:55:03.400" style="s2">that creates the kind of meta meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.930" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">effect right right because we know how</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.400" end="00:55:07.180" style="s2">the story is going on right oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:09.310" style="s2">going to end right and we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.180" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">preoccupied with that right now as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.310" end="00:55:13.240" style="s2">culture the idea of the loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">meta-narrative is deeply deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.240" end="00:55:17.620" style="s2">destabilizing right right sorry</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:19.600" style="s2">and any zombie it&#39;s not even just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.620" end="00:55:21.970" style="s2">this is one of about this I think in our</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.600" end="00:55:23.260" style="s2">next discussion but this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.970" end="00:55:25.180" style="s2">things that Han talks about when he</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.260" end="00:55:26.860" style="s2">talks about the atomization of time time</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.180" end="00:55:29.710" style="s2">no longer leads into eternity no it just</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.860" end="00:55:30.670" style="s2">buzzes just buzzes and so too does the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.710" end="00:55:36.039" style="s2">narrative up this on</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.670" end="00:55:38.710" style="s2">just spiders - it doesn&#39;t conclude ok</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.039" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s very good so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.710" end="00:55:43.299" style="s2">gives the viewers a very good</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.760" end="00:55:44.829" style="s2">understanding of some of the main</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.299" end="00:55:46.210" style="s2">arguments and how they&#39;re ongoing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.829" end="00:55:49.589" style="s2">developing that we pursued in the book</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.210" end="00:55:51.630" style="s2">trying to show how much our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.589" end="00:55:52.750" style="s2">expressing the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.630" end="00:55:56.349" style="s2">symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.750" end="00:56:03.579" style="s2">and how how we could therefore use this</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.349" end="00:56:06.369" style="s2">as a way of roof reflecting on how</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.579" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">people are fundamentally experiencing or</p>
