<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">point a of the old tourism curve</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">with the vision to see how to initiate a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">new tourism curve</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">and in that paper from 1995</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">um you were speaking to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">both the power of what tourism can do to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">connect us</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:51.040" style="s2">as humanity together and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">the deepest functionalities of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.040" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">where tourism was heading then</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">and since then tourism has exploded and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">has become such a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">industry that now in in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">pandemic world we&#39;re realizing how even</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">wealthy not not just some beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">paradisical island states somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">the global south that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">only had tourism as an income but even</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">really wealthy economies</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">with big other legs to stand on are</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">shaken by the fact that their tourism um</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">industry is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">in danger and i mean i live on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">island of mallorca um</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">we basically had the economy collapse</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">here um in the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">two months and the whole of spain</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">portugal</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">so many of the southern european nations</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">have tourism so central</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">to their economy and and therefore also</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">to some extent the well-being of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">and what&#39;s your reading like</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">i i sense we wanted a sea change</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">like when we talked in bruges in</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">september last</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">year um we were talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">tourism can be the motor of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">towards different type of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">re-regionalization and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">and and and actually helping local</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">businesses</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">thrive in local regenerative economies</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">thrive</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">now this this malta seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">serious um</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">problems yeah it&#39;s certainly not stuck</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not starting the way we&#39;d like but</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a motor is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">it&#39;s um it&#39;s made up of a lot of flawed</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">living systems called human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">um yeah i just uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">in conversation with you earlier i just</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">realized the sort of nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">journey in the 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">um i was about to leave canada</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">but in the last few literally the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">year before i</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">i left i had was able</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">to spend a lot more time with first</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">nations people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">and i began to get really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">uh their world</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">view um and the whole systems approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">um and that&#39;s when i wrote that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">paper in 95 and talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">medicine wheel</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">and then and and it&#39;s if it&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">today it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">the indigenous people have such a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">grounded</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">holistic view of the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">desperately need at the moment but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">was interesting is i came to europe and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">i&#39;d also got involved at that time um</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">um technology um i.t</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">um i it was the birth of the commercial</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">internet in 1993-94</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">same year and i did a conference then</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">with a wonderful man called don tapscott</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">who&#39;s a leader in the i.t movement a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">very wise man as it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">and what that introduced me to for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">next few years which is why in a sense i</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">pulled back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">on the surface i appeared to pull back</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">from this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">um this line of inquiry because i got</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">fascinated with the notion that tourism</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">is a network</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not an industry and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">we&#39;re in such trouble</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">is that we&#39;re imposing a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">system of silos and boxes and linear</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">on what is a living dynamic network and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">that covert has shown more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">is just how pervasive that network had</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">become how</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">how it had spread almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">and a meme or an infection actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">it was connected now with everything but</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">it was still being governed</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">and structured in people&#39;s minds and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">operated</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">as if it were some kind of a vertically</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">industry and i think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">reasons why it collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">so quickly if it was a if it was living</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">according to the natural principles of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">a living network</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">and living according to the and all life</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">if it was really living according to how</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">that works in nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t have collapsed the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">it had no resilience it was brittle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">fragile</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">and so you have on the one hand a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">economic sector that has become so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">embedded in society</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">um and yet at the same time it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">so incredibly fragile</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting story so the time i</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">spent in technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">really was helpful it led me into</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">complexity science and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">to be honest with you i found that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">almost too much for my brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">um but you don&#39;t have to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">to the nitty-gritty of all of that to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">understand that these principles</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:56.390" style="s2">these dynamics are what we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">consciously applying now</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.390" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">what what&#39;s your question or have i gone</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">off on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">um i mean i actually it would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">let&#39;s stay there like i i</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">where do you in in your conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">with people in the tourism sector</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">in the last few months um do you sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">that people are actually aware</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">how fundamental the change is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">has now been triggered um like what i</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">noticed here on majorca</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">is that everybody is responding</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">to the pandemic situation</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">and trying to come up with um</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">ways that people can still go to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">restaurants or sit at the pool but</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">maintain social distancing and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">new protocols being written by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">government that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">that are pages long that now small</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">tourism businesses that that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">dying and and struggling for to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">head above water</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">are now laden with um</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">new directives on how if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">open you have to do it this way</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">um and and for me it seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">almost like yesterday i was went finally</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">we were allowed out here again i went</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">for a walk and i saw the first couple of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">restaurants that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">had opened and had we are open come in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:20.879" style="s2">and i could see the staff standing there</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.879" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">twiddling their thumbs and the owner</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">looking slightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">um shocked and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">and i just really felt for these people</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">because i feel like this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">happen all over mallorca</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">is there they can open their hotels and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">people aren&#39;t going to come</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.959" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">no i think well yeah i couldn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">with you more i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">there is any real understanding even at</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">the leadership level in tourism just how</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">uh uh how deeply affected and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">fundamental this shift is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">um it&#39;s they keep talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">and saying it&#39;s an unprecedented event</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">and that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">that&#39;s used usually to excuse the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t weren&#39;t prepared for it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">or we don&#39;t know how to handle it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s huge and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">unprecedented but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">ultimately they&#39;re all saying we it will</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">go away</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">and in the meantime we&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">all of these crazy crazy</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">measures that undermine the very essence</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">hospitality in the first place i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">who wants to go out</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">it means it&#39;s a wonderful opportunity</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">those technocrats that want everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">to be done</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">by robots to sell their wares</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s proving to be a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">opportunity for for for the it community</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">that want to invade our privacy and have</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">go outside and check your app up so</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">someone over there that&#39;s got covered or</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">blah blah better run for cover sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">thing i mean it&#39;s all of this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">separating us so it&#39;s that separation</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">is working um and at the same time with</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">this focus right now on the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s as if climate change has gone away</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">no one&#39;s remembering</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">the fires in australia last night you</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">the notion that we&#39;re in that vortex</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">of a converging of these these</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">there and what the pandemic is doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">is revealing our fragility revealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">that a fundamental way of looking at the</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">it served us post-war to build the kind</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">unfortunately the decisions are being</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">this has been going on almost through my</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">that we think of the people that have</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">focused on</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">on this and done herculean</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">responses you have to ask why why this</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">you know is it because it got touched</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">it got pretty close to the decision</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">makers i mean even our prime minister</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">got it</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">um and i think it shook him up because</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">prior to getting ill um he was acting</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">with great sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">dismissive bravado um because it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">real to him</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m even now i&#39;m not sure how how</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">that how deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">that experience that he had has affected</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">um but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">i just think in answer to your earlier</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">question um</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the tourism industry has</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">um woken up to the fact that this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">this is deep change nothing&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">be the same um</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">but if we&#39;re connected economically is</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">going to be far far deeper than they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">prepared for i mean my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">there will be</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">at least 60 percent less tourism</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">for the next two or three years and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">and and what i think most people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">including me can&#39;t make a statement</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">about right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">is that all we&#39;ve seen at this point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">the effects</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">to now of the direct impact of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:56.079" style="s2">closures and the virus and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">and on the economy um and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.079" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">what what we&#39;re not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">the dominoes that are still falling in</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">every direction and crisscrossing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">causing other dominoes mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">complexity theory and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">earlier like once you once you have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">to think in these systemic networked</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">and to be able to um</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">not predicting control but get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">of the dynamics of this larger global</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">system then</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">we&#39;re not paying attention to to um</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">the warnings that the world health</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">also ordered i think it was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">organization saying that we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">towards a world where maybe 240 million</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">people could be starving because of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">um not</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">like the the the locust plagues and um</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">all the other things that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">including</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">the effects of corbett yeah that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">point really</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">um it&#39;s the inability to see the in</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">connections and interdependencies i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">right now the next thing i would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">um is this whole issue around</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">food security for many places um</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">you know the whole pacific islands for</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">example have become so dependent on this</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">importation of the very food that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">unfortunately killing them</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">and causing diabetes and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">heart disease and so on they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">about two days of food security</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">and so we&#39;re going to see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">start to happen in our own communities i</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">think far more</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">so one thing right now that tourism can</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">do i think is that it can pivot</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">it&#39;s got to pivot its entire dire uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:50.639" style="s2">um away from the overseas markets and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">and focusing on the customer and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:53.759" style="s2">trying it spending millions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.759" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">bringing people into a place and now</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">becoming back</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">part of the community and focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">how do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">um make tourism how does how can tourism</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">to this community becoming really</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve been suggesting with some</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">and limited success but uh in flanders</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">for example is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">again you were obsessed with growth and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">gdp</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">um but that produced over tourism</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:29.040" style="s2">because it had to keep growing in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">to make up for the fact that the model</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.040" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">was producing diminishing returns every</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">year so you had to get bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">but then of course eventually the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">negative impact of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:40.079" style="s2">in terms of the costs of congestion and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">resource use and so on</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.079" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">start to bite you in the tail so</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">yeah yeah so uh model is not working</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">and now the cobit has shown us okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">we&#39;re now going to show you what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">when that comes to you know to stop</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">um i&#39;ve got a graph of the drop of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">arrivals</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">the the arrivals pattern into new</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">zealand for example of people with</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">non-new zealand passwords</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">and i suddenly looked at it last night</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost identical to a graph</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">that was produced</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">in 1997 of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">collapse of the chord fishery you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s that classic</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">you know exponential upwards but huge</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">oscillations increasing and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">yeah and we talked about that um but</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">nobody was listening</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">now they can see it it&#39;s on everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">chance so in fact it&#39;s back now into</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">going inward into</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">land-based um community-based</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">um resilience building and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">building community and getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">thinking as a network but working</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">contributing to the network not just</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">extracting from it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the shift away from okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">we have a massive problem here but what</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">is the potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">for what whatever the tourism will turn</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">into to actually serve um</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">the communities and the regions where</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">the tourism is is active in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">and and that we started this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">or you you started this conversation a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">long time ago but um</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">last year when when when we met in um</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">bruges there was a real sense that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">more and more people around the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">were having a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">what would a regenerative tourism really</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">look like how could</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">tourism industry invest in local food</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">water energy sovereignty build</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">resilience infrastructures that on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">one hand would give</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">the visitors the sense that the money</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">we&#39;re spending is also serving the local</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:41.919" style="s2">community and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">visitors were starting to demand that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.919" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">kind of green tourism or</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">socially engaged tourism and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">uh but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:56.720" style="s2">now i i see that for like if i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">about just the majorcan case um</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">how can i invite the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">key players in the large new york and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">tourism companies into a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be a lot less people</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be coming in different</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">the whole offer has to transform like i</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">i i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">questioning whether people will</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">just jump on a plane</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">to have a little bit of holiday if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">know that the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">still out there and they&#39;re risking</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">their family&#39;s well-being if if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">go on a short trip like the whole kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">of city breaks short</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">trip break patterns a i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">people won&#39;t take the risk e most people</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">won&#39;t have the money because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">struggling in their own employment</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.799" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">situation or company situation</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">is like here on mallorca a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">had second homes on mallorca um who live</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">in northern europe and companies in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">north northern europe will probably end</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:09.039" style="s2">having to sell their holiday homes in</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">order to save their companies back home</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.039" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">um and so what&#39;s what&#39;s your vision in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">actual pattern change like i i can see</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">using the infrastructure for</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">longest day offers where people like for</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">example retired people</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:27.760" style="s2">can come for three months but they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">to go through a certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">quarantine phase and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">on the island and they can use the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">infrastructure um</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">or educational aspect of working</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">like engaging with the local community</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">where it becomes a serving</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">of the community and the experience in</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">the community because in in the past</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">travel was all about seeing with new</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">eyes</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">and and learning and people would</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">ask the question for for most of our</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">history is it worth me taking the risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">of this journey and and that for a while</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a question that anybody asks</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">um and it got cheaper and cheaper to fly</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">and people just did it but i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">that question will be at the center</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">again and so we need to have offers that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">make it worth it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">to to travel again</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">in a different way yeah i agree well i</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">i think the the reality is that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">whether it&#39;s six months or two years i</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">whatever but the the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">international market is going to be um</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">very slow to pick up um so a destination</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">now has to say well</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">how can people travel to us and who will</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">they be</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">so get used to the fact that the sheer</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.039" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">volume of numbers isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">there so you&#39;re dealing with a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">different demand</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">set of demand but really</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">the best thing that destinations can do</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">when i say the word destination a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">destination is simply a place that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">people come to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">right it&#39;s a way it&#39;s it&#39;s focusing our</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">attention on</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">this place as a recipient or a receiver</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">of other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">but um so let&#39;s maybe not use the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">destination let&#39;s use the word community</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">what does a community need to do right</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">to build back its health and resilience</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">um and if it focus and the contourism</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">sector the visitor economy part</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">can may play a very important role</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">in that in my opinion but we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">how can we as</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">let&#39;s say the island of majorca what are</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">the various ways that we can try</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">and keep some of the businesses in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">visitor economy moving uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">with cash flow and starting to explore</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">healthier ways of being so healthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">reducing their costs growing their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">food reducing their energy requirements</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">reducing all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">becoming more efficient effective as</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">local producers so really</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">almost look inward in with the island</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">who are we how we</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">as an island going to be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">the role of the host economy or which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">another way of describing it</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">is in fact to start pulling people</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">together and convening them in</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">that&#39;s really why i felt tourism had</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">such a role to play</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">it is the connector you know it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">just a transaction</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s in the transactions</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s in the numbers business it&#39;s all on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">spreadsheets but in actual fact the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">reality was that it connected</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">people when we perhaps get this may not</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">be practical but</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">in your island but how can we get people</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">one part of the island coming and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">spending time in another part of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">island</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">and really enjoying their time there</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">having an exchange of whatever money is</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">floating around on the island</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">that keeping is keeping businesses</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">afloat how can we start to get a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">greater integration between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">hotels and the restaurants and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">agricultural business</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">um how can we you know become much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">self-sufficient how can we address our</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">food security issues</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">living in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">vortex of of uncertainty and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.159" style="s2">that would require us to deal very</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">differently than we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.159" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">in the past so that led to a number of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">sessions one of the again that flanders</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">is extremely good at</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">is that and they have the wealth that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">they have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">large community of people responsible</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">for for tourism development</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">at the community level but they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">able to bring both private sector and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">the public sector together</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">for a series of meetings around the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">country and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">gradually over a period of time we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">able to introduce the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">you know growth in itself of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">was not really benefiting the country if</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">the costs were not identified</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">or mitigated in other words you could</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">where you had a lot more people</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">producing a lot less benefit or even</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">negative benefit</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t take those into account</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">and that really perhaps a more</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">systems approach a living systems</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">approach would say</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">how can these communities start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">flourish and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">thrive across a number of dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">and this is not new i mean we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">countries of which new zealand is one</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">are now not many but a number are saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">what are we here for is it just to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">produce more gdp</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">which is no measure of well-being or are</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">we here to produce</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">greater well-being so um it was in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">sort of context that i was</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:03.519" style="s2">able to start to talk about tourism as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">living system</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">as a network and that a successful</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">human living system would be like an</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">ecosystem it would have to flourish</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">across multiple dimensions and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">caught on</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">so we started group experimenting taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">small regions but this whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">trouble to tomorrow was again something</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">the market has created which i thought</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">was really good</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">and it became a focal point for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">about doing things differently</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">the other thing that florentis is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">good at is this notion of collecting</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">stories and telling stories of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">making their contribution so what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">is again it mirrors back to people this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">some theoretical idea it&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">our own community now</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">and the question becomes how do we</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">nurture that how do we nourish it</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">and so that that then results in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">other positive feedback loop because</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">people say i can get involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">nurturing process</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">so that was the history there um now</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">because of various contractual reasons i</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">think basically i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve had to step back i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">there are only so much like</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">i can do but there now are um</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">if you like a group of enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">change agents</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">embedded in the community</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">and linkages are being made now which i</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">find exciting with</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">um with other sectors of the economy so</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of watch this space</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">because to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">the irony is it&#39;s a bit like how how</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">does uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">how does a virus um infect us</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">um what we&#39;re looking at is taking the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">meme</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">of a flourishing regenerative type of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">tourism that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:54.559" style="s2">that nurtures development and growth</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.559" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">ins and put that meme into the community</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">and have it spread that notion is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">actually one that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">um interesting the quote you gave</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">earlier with</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">of the new zealand um tourism official</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">um because i</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">i have experienced that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">even before i started working with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">term regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">i um highlighted always that really the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">measure of um</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">wise decision-making is the emergence of</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">what i&#39;ve noticed is</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">futurists um talk about or that</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">um i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">at the center and in your 1995 paper</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.079" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">quoted from earlier you said that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">tourism is a healing profession and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">way that you speak of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">that network of living networks</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">i can i can see that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">that&#39;s really the essence of when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">create a tourism that is for itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">but is also part of a larger whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">gives back more than it takes because</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">that is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">if increasingly the essence</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">of being regenerative is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">dance between that polarity</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">of in for oneself and being part of a</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s how you reconcile and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.359" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">more question because you&#39;ve worked in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">mexico and and in new zealand also on</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">similar projects or with with similar</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">well certainly um i think the</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">earlier than here</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">um but i i i was thinking while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">asking me this</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">the work i did in with flanders and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t just me there were a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">other people that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:50.320" style="s2">were already setting the stage the folks</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">in social tourism the folks and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.320" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">they were doing this huge storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">exercise which was so</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">helpful it was no it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">softening the soil</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">if you like um but all that work that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">took place between 2017</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">and 19 was done without really using the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">word regeneration at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">and in fact i think in my own work i</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">um by by putting too much focus on</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">regenerative to it&#39;s a mouthful</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s hard to explain</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">um from from cold but when we talk about</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">that is healthy that you are caring</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">about each other</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">to me because</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">the word um hospitality is the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">route as</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">hospice and hospital it&#39;s about caring</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:25.839" style="s2">it&#39;s about holding it&#39;s about making</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">people whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.839" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">so we&#39;re in that business anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">you know i know i&#39;m rambling a bit but i</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this focus away from selling</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">something to someone else</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">outside and now coming back and making</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">this place</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">a healthy whole caring place that will</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">attract</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">this is the difference it will naturally</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">attract</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">people who are seeking those values</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s standing head and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">shoulders i say look at look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">the flowers you know they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">marketing plans and marketing</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">expenditure they just</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">each flower is doing its flower thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">it&#39;s being who it is and it&#39;s attracting</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">a certain kind of bee it doesn&#39;t affect</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">so can&#39;t we take that analogy in tourism</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">well it reminds me of one of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">most important mentors brian goodwin um</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">he said to me once daniel it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">important to be the center of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">rather than the center of attention</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">yes that&#39;s beautiful i&#39;ll remember that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">one that is the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">we we we know that people gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">to people who are full of vitality and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:41.920" style="s2">energy and enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">provided that they also are full of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.920" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">empathy</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">and caring you know you can have</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">vitality and enthusiasm and be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">narcissistic bastard</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">and no one really wants to hang around</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">you very much</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:54.560" style="s2">you might get a lot of attention but</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to attract people into</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.560" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">your community</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">around you um and this is the same in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">tourism</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">constantly are saying how can we be the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">i said you know just be yourself nobody</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">else can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">you this for me this is like as you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">speaking as</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">as reminded of my</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">my highest hope like if if the five</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">choose to live on an island that is so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">dependent on tourism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">and almost responsible for the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:30.880" style="s2">tourism that we now see in the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.880" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">the the people that are still alive</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve started here with a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">hotels because of the beauty of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">island and now they have empires of</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">unique point where governments will have</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">have endangered the economy</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">now that we&#39;ve endangered the economy</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">already and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:27.599" style="s2">when we&#39;re in kind of</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">and for me a really bold leadership</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">on this island would be to say okay</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.839" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">maybe less and we will pay people</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:06.880" style="s2">to help get this island shipshape again</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">to heal this island</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">to make this the most attractive</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">destination in the future</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">since we&#39;ve got two or three years until</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">multiple waves of this virus will get to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:21.119" style="s2">a point where the virus gets</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">less virulent and and the situation</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">will maybe adjust itself nobody knows</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">let&#39;s use it</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">and do exactly that heal the island</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">build the local resilience build food</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">sovereignty energy</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">and put in the infrastructure that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">use waste water to irrigate dry lands</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">and um we we could do it</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">uh but it but it and and i i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">while for most tourism players this kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s a diversion from core</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what we do ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">they rely on the beauty health and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">resilience of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">the destinations in which well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re saying with a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">illustrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">um examples with what i&#39;m basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">saying as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">i think the challenge in majorca is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">that probably um</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">the tourism industry&#39;s wealth has been</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">quite concentrated in the hands of a few</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">players but the reality is throughout</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.119" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">is that generally speaking 95 to 98</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">of the participants the suppliers in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">tourism are small medium-sized</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">enterprises</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s at the community level i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the island well but but</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">getting this idea of this vision now</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">amongst the young people of majorca that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">you know also sitting idly and wondering</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">um i think you know to sort of infect</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">them with</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">this vision that we don&#39;t want 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">from now to be in a similar situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">the second pro the second message of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">course is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">we may get on top of the pandemic but</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s all these other factors are not</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">going away i mean the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">you know could be drought we could go</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">through a period of drought we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">you know the the um uh yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">the economy is again another big issue</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">dependent with your tourism economy on</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">people having enough disposable income</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">in your uh origin source markets to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">able to come to new york</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">and that may not be the case either</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">exactly so um</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:42.880" style="s2">right now i&#39;m saying to people if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">got a bit of land start learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.880" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">grow on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">you might be very grateful a few years</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">from now but the tourism industry if</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">they can start to realize the connection</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">between as you say</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">uh shade food water</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">um going back to hosting if you like</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">maybe the tourism industry starts to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">host</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">parties of people who&#39;ve come together</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">growing things um you know what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">saying go back to that idea as we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">we&#39;re the hub in the community we pull</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">people together where ideas like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.920" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">can circulate and and ferment and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">percolate</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">in this this vision of could the tourism</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">industry in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">like if they if they just accept that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">the crisis like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">if they start thinking in terms of two</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">or three years response rather than this</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">immediate response because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">happening with the immediate response is</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">that the regulations the government is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">around how you can reopen your hotel is</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">making it impossible to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">responsible hotel anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">basically it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">one way like how often do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">change it</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">we have to change this plastic apron and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">these plastic gloves and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">the amount of product that is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">where we&#39;re just having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">about deplastifying the tourism industry</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">and they were doing a good job here on</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">majorca when a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">the chains of really kind of taking that</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">that we can manage it and control it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">and you end up just if it wasn&#39;t dead</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">i mean the whole reason to come to an</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">island like new yorker is to sit in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">open-air cafe and watch people</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:59.920" style="s2">northerners in europe want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">experience right so um no i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">if i were an island i&#39;d say the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">important thing and that&#39;s why i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">new zealand</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">is an island country but you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">island within spain</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">is to say how do we make our island how</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">do we build its immune system</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">so that this becomes a really healthy</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">place where</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">pandemics like this cannot you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">spread how do we put in place</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to have any</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">interventions it&#39;s more about how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">protect the island</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">from infection from outside but the best</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">way of resisting disease is to build an</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">immunity system</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">so that you know there&#39;s a whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">putting people to stay inside for months</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">on end</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">and completely you know not have</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">sunlight not have fresh air and all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">is also bizarre because you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">draining their</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">immunity system that&#39;s why i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">about the care home situation</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">so if we can go back to this idea of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">do we build a healthy community a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">flourishing community in our own right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">and then have the opportunity of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">extending the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">because we really know who we are and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">what we stand for and we know the kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">of people that are going to want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">are attracted to us we then just simply</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">invite we don&#39;t have to pummel them to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">death with</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:21.680" style="s2">with endless advertising and promotional</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.680" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">we just say this is who we are what</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">we&#39;re doing people will want to come</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">to see it to experience it</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s better than the ones</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve got at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">i i was working on</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">a pathway to engage tourism in this</p>

<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">with this impulse of the</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">could actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">create a 20-year strategy</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">not just about getting rich people</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">spending a pilot you know</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">but we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.440" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">so okay um i don&#39;t have a checklist of</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">and now that you if we both did we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">quite wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">but you know where is the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">for that it&#39;s in the community</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">so maybe you you can get someone to</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">and also have them linked digitally as</p>

<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">our community what do we love about here</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">what are the produce that we we think we</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">do best and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">blah blah blah you know but turn it</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:33.040" style="s2">around something tangible not just ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">not not</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.040" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">concepts but get people talking and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.839" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">caring again</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:41.599" style="s2">and out of that i think that makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">since we need to increase our food</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.599" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">security rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">and to prepare for what&#39;s coming and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">clear maybe use food and the hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">people make it possible to meet and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">convene</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">but the focus is on on food and health</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">and the work that you&#39;ve because you</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">work you got caught in new zealand with</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">all this</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">and and you were working with people in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:09.280" style="s2">the bay of plenty on on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:12.640" style="s2">um project helping them</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:15.200" style="s2">rethink their well yeah i mean they</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.640" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">what well the bear plenty basically um</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.200" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">one of 30 regions in new zealand</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:23.680" style="s2">and they had re-completely revamped</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">their whole strategy and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">things that was really great about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">the amount of community engagement</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">i mean they didn&#39;t just come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">strategy which often these</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">dmos do they went out and found out</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">what um what the community cared about</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">what they wanted what they didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:43.040" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:44.720" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t one of the hot spots</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.040" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">in new zealand it&#39;s it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.720" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">part of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">of the country so they did a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">so there was that sense of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">there they also did some work on what</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">they call their dna</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">so what is it that is unique about us</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">and how can we express that um and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">brought</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">the importance of the resident</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">population really</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">caring or loving their own destination</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">so bringing that those emotions of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">affection and pride and so on</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">um so they began to weave in some if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">regenerative concepts of bring putting</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">more back in than</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">than taking out so um they were about to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">launch this strategy</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">we had at the very time that this whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">pandemic thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">was breaking and so we had some good</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">sessions</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">and and i was fortunate enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">uh to one of the sessions where i um you</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">remember that beautiful poem that came</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">you know the what is the voice of govid</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">um it&#39;s asking us to stop</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:55.599" style="s2">and reflect it&#39;s a beautiful poem i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">sure you&#39;re familiar with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.599" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">italian i think it was a sculptor it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:00.160" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">and i was able to read a bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.160" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">poem and what i what</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">really um impressed me was was the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">resonance</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">at a human level it moved people they</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">realized that this</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">message was what they wanted to hear at</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">the same time their businesses were</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:20.839" style="s2">you know were tanking so um</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">the challenge i think right now is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you know this this this</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:28.960" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">almost spiritual desire to to build</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.960" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">something new</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">but you&#39;ve got the reality of paying</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">your bills</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">organizational structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:40.480" style="s2">of what the budget is going to be and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">who&#39;s going to do what and all the rest</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:46.240" style="s2">so where we&#39;re at with that is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">michelle holliday and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">felt that you know we couldn&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">people together in groups because of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:55.359" style="s2">lockdown that we would try and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">develop an online program that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.359" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">could start to get involved in</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">um over the winter months and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">just get some of these ideas that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">talking about now</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">discussed in their communities but have</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">some access to information and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">so that the the recovery could gradually</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">move in that regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">direction but that would be specifically</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">for communities in</p>

<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">and this was before their lockdown is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">being lifted</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">um they&#39;ve done an exceptional job in</p>

<p begin="01:00:01.280" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">the idea was to find a mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">of seeding i think that&#39;s the best way</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:10.640" style="s2">of putting it</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">some of these regenerative concepts</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.640" end="01:00:16.000" style="s2">amongst the tourism community and</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">getting conversations going</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.000" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">um while you were down there did you</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:21.839" style="s2">connect because</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge amount of amazing</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">in the auckland bay area and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:30.240" style="s2">so powerful is that more than half of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.240" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">um of maori or</p>

<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:40.319" style="s2">to some extent what all this</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">regenerative development and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.319" end="01:00:43.760" style="s2">regenerative design and regenerative</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.760" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">trying to do is to come back to a wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been holding</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">for centuries which brings us back to</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">the beginning of your story of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.119" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">your time in canada where you learn so</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s when i realized that i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">suited for academia</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">um i found it too too confining um</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">but that&#39;s when i was first exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">the maori uh community and then i spent</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">a lot of time in the south pacific</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a polynesian uh culture</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">um but yes um this is the beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">thing about new zealand</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">is that it has this wealth</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:30.880" style="s2">and what i&#39;m saying is this program that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:33.040" style="s2">we&#39;re developing</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.880" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to reach out to the maori</p>

<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">there were limits to what we could do um</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">but we started something and um</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.280" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll see how it goes we&#39;ll keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">working on it</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">one more question so we don&#39;t make this</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:42.880" style="s2">recording to too long</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m sorry anybody who&#39;s still</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">very committed because we make like</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:50.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve rambled a bit too</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">but we had a conversation this is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.720" end="01:02:55.839" style="s2">people think</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">the um you mentioned just before we</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.839" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">started to record you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">um that you&#39;re part of this group that</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">is more of an academic group</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">that was looking into tourism and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:07.359" style="s2">climate change</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">and a couple of times skirted on this</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.359" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">that of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">on the one hand there is a role for</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.559" end="01:03:16.559" style="s2">importance and like so many people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:18.880" style="s2">wealth</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.559" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">like families livelihood depend on</p>

<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">on the other hand it was part of driving</p>

<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:28.079" style="s2">in a dangerous way and so um</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:31.200" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.079" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">you mentioned that you put some ideas</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.200" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">towards this group of academics</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">and were somewhat surprised to actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">see them land</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:43.599" style="s2">like what what what is your take on how</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:46.799" style="s2">tourism as as a as a global</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.599" end="01:03:50.079" style="s2">network needs to respond</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.799" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">to what is the much bigger</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.079" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">danger on the horizon of cataclysmic</p>

<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">and and how to reinvent itself to not be</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.720" end="01:04:04.319" style="s2">be complicit in driving it but actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:07.119" style="s2">being</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">industry with hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">people involved in</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">and there are a lot of people uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:22.480" style="s2">individuals um particularly and some</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:24.559" style="s2">institutions that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.480" end="01:04:26.319" style="s2">have been very concerned about its</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.559" end="01:04:30.319" style="s2">contribution to</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.319" end="01:04:33.440" style="s2">carbon emissions um the aviation</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.319" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">um portion of that is of main concern</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.440" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">so um i would hate for there to be any</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:39.200" style="s2">implication that there isn&#39;t an awful</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.200" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">really good thinking and work going on</p>

<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">um but then kovit came along and now</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.200" end="01:04:48.160" style="s2">everyone&#39;s focused on recovery from</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">covet and</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.160" end="01:04:51.760" style="s2">climate change has sort of proceeded in</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">the background what i think we have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.760" end="01:04:54.880" style="s2">do is bring back that climate change</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.880" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">and show that this the the the way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">approaching</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">dealing with climate change is the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">as the way of</p>

<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:09.520" style="s2">relink it&#39;s a system</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.720" end="01:05:11.599" style="s2">and just the very idea that we created</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.520" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">the covet pandemic it didn&#39;t appear</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.599" end="01:05:15.280" style="s2">out of the blue it wasn&#39;t sent by the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">gods to punish us</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.280" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">we created the conditions that enabled</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:21.760" style="s2">those viruses to mutate</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">and until we take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.760" end="01:05:24.319" style="s2">that and why did we do that because</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.319" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">a con society that&#39;s consuming way</p>

<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:42.319" style="s2">so it&#39;s a constantly a talk of</p>

<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">um and i think kovid&#39;s done an awful lot</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.119" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">to help us in that regard</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">your question because i</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.920" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">tend to think and forget me</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.559" end="01:06:13.039" style="s2">it is a bit of a paradox this whole the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">how important it is to stay able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.039" end="01:06:16.880" style="s2">travel and build</p>

<p begin="01:06:28.000" end="01:06:34.559" style="s2">um finding the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">measure again of when to travel how long</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.559" end="01:06:39.760" style="s2">to travel how often to travel</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:42.400" style="s2">i think we we&#39;ve kind of gone</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.760" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">for a decade or two we were just beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.400" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">proportions</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">of these these um fast turnover</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:51.039" style="s2">trips um there were two you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">two kinds of travel that really</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.039" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">in my opinion were doing the harm and</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">one it was the cheap travel where no one</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">value chain was paying the true price of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">the consumer wasn&#39;t because it was being</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">offered you know the 25</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:10.400" style="s2">uh pound flights from london to nice for</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:13.119" style="s2">example for a you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.400" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">for a party this weekend that that has</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.119" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">to stop</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:17.280" style="s2">and it will stop because as cheap travel</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.280" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">you can expect that as we come out of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.839" end="01:07:22.319" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:24.559" style="s2">um come out of this and plane start</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">flying it will be a lot more expensive</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.559" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">so that impulse just go because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">cheap won&#39;t be there</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">which is important the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">contribution to the problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">was that something like uh 75</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:43.680" style="s2">of the emissions were contributed by</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">15 of the flyers</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.680" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">or even less than that i&#39;m not good at</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">numbers</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">but that proportion and that was because</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">there were certain people in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">population would again</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:55.920" style="s2">they weren&#39;t necessarily trivial trips</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:57.200" style="s2">they think they were important trips</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.920" end="01:07:58.480" style="s2">they were going to see the banker they</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.200" end="01:08:01.280" style="s2">were going to have meetings</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.480" end="01:08:03.440" style="s2">this constant business related flying</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.280" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">and so on or it could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.440" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">you know someone in ghana who&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.839" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">wealthy and just pops back at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">weekend to see</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:12.559" style="s2">their kids in the private school they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:15.359" style="s2">in right so there was an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.559" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">what i call elitist excessive travel</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.359" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">that was contributing to the emissions</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.600" style="s2">if you take that out and you look at</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:23.920" style="s2">what we&#39;re left with in the next two</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.600" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">years we could have it&#39;s not the end of</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.920" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">international travel or flights</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:30.960" style="s2">you know we are global we are now a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">planet we are now connected</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.960" end="01:08:36.080" style="s2">i think it will will start to regulate</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">itself but the most important thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.080" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">is that we develop really</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">um uh attractive and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:49.440" style="s2">meaningful opportunities for travel um</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">within our own within our own spaces</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.440" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">so that that need to jump on a plane</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:08:58.880" style="s2">um is not as as great as it was but that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:01.440" style="s2">need was really a manufactured one in</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.880" end="01:09:02.799" style="s2">the sense that we could do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.440" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">but i think most people who were doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.799" end="01:09:05.600" style="s2">those kind of trips came back more</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:08.159" style="s2">exhausted than they were</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.600" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">i mean what you just spoke to is so</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.159" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">typically</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">actually myokin and character um when</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">when you like i&#39;ve lived here now for</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">ten years and quite often when you when</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:20.640" style="s2">you say to people i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">california and people would say um why</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.640" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">want to go to california go to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">philanthropy looks the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">then you say i&#39;m going to galicia well</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:30.480" style="s2">go to uk looks the same so because the</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">island is so diverse</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.480" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">in a very on a very small island and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">is actually true that you could</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why so much of the audio visual</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">industry likes using this</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:42.480" style="s2">as a place to shoot films because you</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:43.600" style="s2">actually have such a diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.480" end="01:09:46.080" style="s2">landscapes so</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.600" end="01:09:47.199" style="s2">in many ways they somehow it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.080" end="01:09:50.080" style="s2">myokine soul</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.199" end="01:09:51.839" style="s2">to to say we live in the best place we</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.080" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">don&#39;t need to travel anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.839" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">but if that attitude exists then use</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:09:59.760" style="s2">that to harness this</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.560" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">re revitalization of the place so people</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.760" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">from one end of the island are</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">encouraged</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:06.880" style="s2">to go and visit people at the other end</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:07.840" style="s2">of the island and exchange ideas and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.880" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.840" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">but um yeah i would say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:12.719" style="s2">strength you have if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:15.600" style="s2">you know sufficiently aware that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:17.280" style="s2">have uh the world in microcosms on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.600" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">island</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.280" end="01:10:20.640" style="s2">well thank you so much for this</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">conversation we could go on but</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">um this has been really rich and i</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:29.679" style="s2">yeah as soon as this is lift up</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">i would love to come and explore with</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.679" end="01:10:33.040" style="s2">you um it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:34.640" style="s2">because i really have i do believe in</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.040" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">our islands we</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.640" end="01:10:39.440" style="s2">are great places to work with i was in</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">the azores and they&#39;ve doing some very</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:42.640" style="s2">interesting things there and i&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:45.679" style="s2">interest in the pacific</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.640" end="01:10:46.239" style="s2">and they&#39;re incredibly vulnerable um and</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.679" end="01:10:49.120" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">you know what we could do it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.120" end="01:10:53.040" style="s2">that we try and support them</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve basically extracted</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.040" end="01:10:56.000" style="s2">so much wealth and pleasure out of those</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.000" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">with putting very little back in no i</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s i moved to mallorca</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">because majorca is</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">the right size for being an example of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">regional regeneration so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.360" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">regional case study and i think islands</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">because they come in different shapes</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:18.080" style="s2">and sizes um</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">their wonderful uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.080" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">field study opportunity to for for</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">regional transformation and in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.120" end="01:11:26.400" style="s2">healing of the landscape and healing of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">the relationship between people and</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.400" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:30.480" style="s2">um that we actually need to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:32.159" style="s2">everywhere around the world but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.480" end="01:11:34.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit easier to do</p>
