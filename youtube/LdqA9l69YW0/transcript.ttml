<p begin="00:00:03.360" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">fats bad fats necessary fat sourcing of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:10.260" style="s2">them fats and cholesterol and their</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">relationship to the brain you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.260" end="00:00:18.840" style="s2">hard to again be judgmental on fats come</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:20.580" style="s2">back to the to the good and bad you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.840" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">it just drives me crazy that people call</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">a good cholesterol and bad cholesterol</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">number one to call it cholesterol is is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:29.310" style="s2">a misnomer</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">I mean LDL and HDL they&#39;re lipoproteins</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.310" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re significantly more than</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">just cholesterol but we&#39;ve got them</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">classified as cholesterol the the LDL</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:43.050" style="s2">though I mean people look at it as bad</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:45.989" style="s2">cholesterol and it&#39;s a truly wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.050" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">cholesterol I mean it is like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.989" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">low-density lipoproteins LDL I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">transport fats all over our body for use</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">in really healthy functions right you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.750" style="s2">know there are different types of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">LDL and you can you can classify that on</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">a particle test which is important to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">but to classify LDL is all bad</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:11.909" style="s2">cholesterol and all HDL is good is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">really not accurate and and again you</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">know just get rid of the judgment on</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.560" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">that and understand what you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">at more so those who don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">what does LDL do that&#39;s useful you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">mentioned transport fats but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">think most people know the role that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">has in say hormones steroid hormone</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:30.509" style="s2">pathways or what the brain is made up of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">ER I mean cholesterol is that is a core</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">and LDLs transport cholesterol as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">so they&#39;re taking cholesterol around I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">mean our brain has a ton of cholesterol</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">in it or every cell wall in our body is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">made up of fats and cholesterol and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">LDL is transporting stuff around</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">delivering it our hormones are hormones</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:56.780" style="s2">like the core component of hormones that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">they&#39;re produced from is cholesterol</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.780" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">vitamin D is made from cholesterol so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all of these really beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">aspects of cholesterol and yet we put</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">people on these low cholesterol diets</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">which are basically killing them</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">because there you&#39;re limiting an</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">essential thriving type of nutrient that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be classified that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.400" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">you know these these fats and and there</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:26.070" style="s2">are there are good and bad but most of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:29.070" style="s2">the time the good and bad are related</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.070" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">more so to your individual genetics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.070" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">and how your body responds to it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">you look at the French and Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:39.020" style="s2">paradox and they consume significantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">more fat I mean the Mediterraneans alone</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.020" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">consumed 40 to 50 percent of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:46.530" style="s2">calories in fat and have the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">heart disease rate well why is that well</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.530" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">one genetics and two they consume the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">majority of their cholesterol in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:55.350" style="s2">forms of olive oil or fats in the form</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:56.850" style="s2">of olive oil I mean almost 50 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.350" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">their calories they drink almost a liter</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.850" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">a week of olive oil on a classic</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:04.770" style="s2">Mediterranean dietary pattern I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:06.870" style="s2">liter a week of olive oil I try to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.770" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">that I think it&#39;s a highly beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.870" end="00:03:13.830" style="s2">from an epigenetic standpoint I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">these things impact not only the direct</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.830" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">utilization of these fats in creation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:29.520" style="s2">of hormones and and other lipoproteins</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">throughout the body but they also alter</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.520" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">epigenetic expression so they can change</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">gene expression omega-3s and olive oil</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">both monounsaturated fats and omega-3s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:42.630" style="s2">they are wonderful about how they change</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">gene expression in a very positive way</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.630" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">in people now omega sixes and saturated</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">fats they can be good for some people</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">but they can also be significantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">problematic in people it just depends on</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:58.830" style="s2">the individual now a mega threes and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.220" end="00:04:01.950" style="s2">and monounsaturated fats typically</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.830" end="00:04:06.050" style="s2">pretty good across the board but not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.950" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">omega sixes and the saturated fats and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.050" end="00:04:10.170" style="s2">so that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:11.640" style="s2">understand your body&#39;s response to those</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.170" end="00:04:14.850" style="s2">because they can have a profound</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.640" end="00:04:17.220" style="s2">difference in the body&#39;s body&#39;s outcome</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.850" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">with the intake of those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.220" end="00:04:21.539" style="s2">nutrients and you know everybody groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">fat into one macronutrient and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.539" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">I mean it should never have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:28.340" style="s2">if I&#39;d that way I mean you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.460" end="00:04:30.290" style="s2">look at fats as separate macronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.340" end="00:04:34.580" style="s2">you have saturated fat you have Omega 9</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.290" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">omega-6 and omega-3 s and and look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:38.570" style="s2">them from that macronutrient standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:41.570" style="s2">rather than looking at them as fats as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.570" end="00:04:42.710" style="s2">general recommendation okay so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.570" end="00:04:44.900" style="s2">to ask you a bunch of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.710" end="00:04:46.910" style="s2">they&#39;re so ok you you mentioned a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:48.260" style="s2">high amount of olive oil intake and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.910" end="00:04:50.060" style="s2">imagine that&#39;s going to be an actionable</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.260" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">step some people follow up with it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.060" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">olive oil created equal</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:56.630" style="s2">no no there&#39;s a I don&#39;t have to often</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.400" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">send you the link that you can put in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.630" end="00:05:01.610" style="s2">the podcast but there&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">evaluation of olive oils and in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.610" end="00:05:04.550" style="s2">United States</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:06.590" style="s2">apparently the rule is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.550" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">still call it extra-virgin olive oil and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.590" end="00:05:11.030" style="s2">still add certain amounts of vegetable</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">oil to it and it also happens in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.030" end="00:05:13.729" style="s2">of the European olive oils that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:15.979" style="s2">shipped into the United States</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.729" end="00:05:19.070" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got to get it number one from</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.979" end="00:05:22.250" style="s2">a very reputable source and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.070" end="00:05:25.250" style="s2">make sure that that you&#39;re getting it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.250" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">a dark bottle you know people people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.250" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">afraid to cook with extra virgin olive</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.110" end="00:05:31.640" style="s2">oil because of the smoke point but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:33.530" style="s2">spent some time in Italy with some</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.640" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">dietitians in Italy and looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.530" end="00:05:39.200" style="s2">studies on cooking with extra-virgin</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:41.630" style="s2">olive oil and unless you&#39;re deep-frying</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.200" end="00:05:43.910" style="s2">with it and using it over several days</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.630" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">in the deep fryer you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.910" end="00:05:50.030" style="s2">really get the R in Sidda T to it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">can create problems with the oxidation</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.030" end="00:05:55.970" style="s2">of the olive oil so your the oxidation</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2">of the fats in the olive oil so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.970" end="00:06:02.150" style="s2">still pretty good to go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:06:05.320" style="s2">stir-fry with it your you can cook on</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.150" end="00:06:08.870" style="s2">higher heat with it without the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.320" end="00:06:11.570" style="s2">significant problems so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.870" end="00:06:13.669" style="s2">a point that maybe not everyone knows in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.570" end="00:06:15.050" style="s2">terms of saying bad fats there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.669" end="00:06:16.729" style="s2">certain kinds of fats that I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.050" end="00:06:20.630" style="s2">everyone really wants to avoid trans</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.729" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">fats definitely and oxidized fats yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.630" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2">you want to describe those categories</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:27.350" style="s2">and be a little bit yeah I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.770" end="00:06:30.110" style="s2">trans fats is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.350" end="00:06:33.050" style="s2">the body is incapable of utilizing in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.110" end="00:06:34.099" style="s2">any way it&#39;s like a foreign material to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.050" end="00:06:37.400" style="s2">the body I mean you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.099" end="00:06:39.860" style="s2">synthetic that is truly synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.400" end="00:06:41.960" style="s2">and the body is incapable of in any way</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.860" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">using it and it gets stored in the body</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.960" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">and unfortunately you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:48.860" style="s2">like any of the organic toxins that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:51.259" style="s2">have I mean we store those in them in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.860" end="00:06:53.690" style="s2">the fat cells in our body but trans fats</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.259" end="00:06:57.729" style="s2">are very similar they get stored in for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.690" end="00:07:00.229" style="s2">years we used Crisco which was just pure</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.729" end="00:07:02.210" style="s2">trans fat paste that we used in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.229" end="00:07:04.310" style="s2">everything before we realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.210" end="00:07:08.389" style="s2">was really creating all the health</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.310" end="00:07:11.000" style="s2">problems that that are happening but you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.389" end="00:07:13.880" style="s2">know when when fats get oxidized and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.000" end="00:07:16.789" style="s2">what happens is a double bond within the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.880" end="00:07:19.400" style="s2">fat itself will get hit with a free</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.789" end="00:07:22.610" style="s2">radical and that free radical will add</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.400" end="00:07:24.919" style="s2">an oxygen to that double bond and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.610" end="00:07:27.229" style="s2">creates what we call a rancid fat or an</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.919" end="00:07:29.780" style="s2">oxidized fat and those are ones that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.229" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">body recognizes and says oh this is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.780" end="00:07:33.320" style="s2">is foreign material this is bad this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:34.699" style="s2">an invader I&#39;ve got to wall it off and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.320" end="00:07:37.960" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that get put into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.699" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">walls of the vessels and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.960" end="00:07:43.580" style="s2">rancid fats are the ones that have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:45.139" style="s2">higher carcinogenic load yes so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.580" end="00:07:48.169" style="s2">people understand that trans fat</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.139" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">basically means I hate hydrogenated fat</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.169" end="00:07:51.979" style="s2">some kind of unsaturated fat they had</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:54.740" style="s2">hydrogen added so this is your margarine</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.979" end="00:07:57.590" style="s2">Crisco vegetable shortening when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.740" end="00:08:00.320" style="s2">take anything that says partially</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.590" end="00:08:04.900" style="s2">hydrogenated soybean oil all of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.320" end="00:08:04.900" style="s2">should be kind of rigorously avoided and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.289" end="00:08:12.530" style="s2">you I don&#39;t think you can eat fast food</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.270" end="00:08:15.550" style="s2">and avoid it so that&#39;s a good point and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.530" end="00:08:19.220" style="s2">so fat that is damaged by hydrogenation</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.550" end="00:08:20.599" style="s2">should be avoided oxidized so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.220" end="00:08:22.610" style="s2">typically happens when you&#39;re cooking</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.599" end="00:08:24.530" style="s2">particularly sensitive fats at too high</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.610" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">a temperature and so you notice there</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.530" end="00:08:27.500" style="s2">are some fats that are so sensitive like</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:28.820" style="s2">fish oil or flax oil that you keep in</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.500" end="00:08:30.710" style="s2">the fridge all the time because they can</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.820" end="00:08:35.270" style="s2">oxidize even at room temperature over a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.710" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">long enough period so many people like</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.270" end="00:08:41.000" style="s2">to if they&#39;re going to have their fat in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.190" style="s2">touch with a pan right if they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.000" end="00:08:46.190" style="s2">have it at that heat just go straight to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.190" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">a healthier saturated fat like coconut</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.190" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">oil or butter or palm oil what are your</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">thoughts on that well like I said I</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">I found that the studies on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:08:59.660" style="s2">extra-virgin olive oil does not create a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:02.270" style="s2">significant amount of oxidation even</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.660" end="00:09:04.400" style="s2">with the high heats and you know I used</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.270" end="00:09:05.960" style="s2">to be the big proponent of you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.400" end="00:09:08.300" style="s2">don&#39;t use extra virgin olive oil for</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.960" end="00:09:09.980" style="s2">high heat cooking but then when the data</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.300" end="00:09:11.960" style="s2">started coming out on it and I started</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.980" end="00:09:13.820" style="s2">speaking with a lot of the the Italian</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.960" end="00:09:17.300" style="s2">dietitians and we&#39;ve looked at the data</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.820" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">the research data on what it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.300" end="00:09:22.310" style="s2">truly oxidize the extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:26.210" style="s2">I realized that it&#39;s not only the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.310" end="00:09:27.560" style="s2">temperature but the time and that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.210" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">something that I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.560" end="00:09:32.060" style="s2">miss is that they&#39;re they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:33.710" style="s2">you know oh it&#39;s the high heat well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.060" end="00:09:35.870" style="s2">the high heat plus the time of exposure</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.710" end="00:09:38.060" style="s2">to that high heat that&#39;s important so a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.870" end="00:09:42.110" style="s2">fast stir-fry is gonna be different than</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.060" end="00:09:43.700" style="s2">a long simmering process and I yes so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.110" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">would actually love to see that data if</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.700" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">you can send it to me and then I&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:51.020" style="s2">link it in this podcast if we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:53.540" style="s2">because I still AM of the mindset that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.020" end="00:09:54.740" style="s2">cooks with coconut oil or a saturated</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.540" end="00:09:57.430" style="s2">fat that has a much harder time</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.740" end="00:10:00.700" style="s2">oxidizing because it&#39;s all double bonds</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.430" end="00:10:05.710" style="s2">so I&#39;d be interested to see that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.700" end="00:10:08.020" style="s2">thank you so so we mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.710" end="00:10:10.280" style="s2">cholesterol is obviously necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.020" end="00:10:17.320" style="s2">there&#39;s also issues of oxidized</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.280" end="00:10:20.120" style="s2">cholesterol yeah so how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.320" end="00:10:21.980" style="s2">well any fat can oxidize I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.120" end="00:10:24.020" style="s2">just free radicals I mean anytime you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:26.210" style="s2">have a double bond a double bond can get</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">oxidized by an oxygen free radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.210" end="00:10:31.730" style="s2">because it&#39;s circulating around looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">for a place to really you know get a get</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.730" end="00:10:40.220" style="s2">a donor electron there so it&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:42.380" style="s2">around for these these potential sites</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.220" end="00:10:47.990" style="s2">and double bonds are the the clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.380" end="00:10:50.570" style="s2">target and the the fats the double bonds</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.990" end="00:10:53.450" style="s2">and the fats are easy pickins for these</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.570" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">free radicals and anytime something gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.450" end="00:10:57.560" style="s2">oxidized I mean it&#39;s just not a natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:59.630" style="s2">process anymore once that oxidation</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.560" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">occurs the body looks at it and says</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.630" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">okay there&#39;s something wrong with this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">and I have to do something to react to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.230" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">any oxidation process is going to create</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:11.950" style="s2">an inflammatory response it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.410" end="00:11:14.790" style="s2">create some type of protective response</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.950" end="00:11:16.900" style="s2">from the body so when you take</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.790" end="00:11:18.700" style="s2">particularly sensitive fats and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.900" end="00:11:21.520" style="s2">cholesterol right some of the highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.700" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">polyunsaturated like that are in fish</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.520" end="00:11:30.970" style="s2">and that are in good DHA free-range eggs</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">do you cook them differently factoring</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.970" end="00:11:39.520" style="s2">that you know the biggest the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">thing to consider is the how much free</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.520" end="00:11:43.840" style="s2">radical production a person typically</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">has I mean I think that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.840" end="00:11:47.650" style="s2">consider when you&#39;re and this goes back</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:50.740" style="s2">to looking at the whole picture of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.650" end="00:11:52.690" style="s2">things rather than you know going</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.740" end="00:11:55.000" style="s2">straight to this and saying okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.690" end="00:11:57.490" style="s2">a good or a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.000" end="00:12:02.280" style="s2">you look at the overall picture so why</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.490" end="00:12:05.890" style="s2">do people get a negative response from</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.280" end="00:12:07.480" style="s2">from a fad that&#39;s that&#39;s consumed that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.890" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">could potentially oxidize well you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.480" end="00:12:12.520" style="s2">you could eat really healthy fats that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">and you and not consume oxidized fats or</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.520" end="00:12:16.360" style="s2">trans fats but if you&#39;re generating a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">lot of free radicals you&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.360" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">your own inside your body anyway so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:22.960" style="s2">you want to do is you want to mitigate</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:25.210" style="s2">all the processes that are involved if</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.960" end="00:12:26.980" style="s2">you can so you minimize the inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.210" end="00:12:29.350" style="s2">you minimize the free radical production</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.980" end="00:12:31.450" style="s2">as much as you can I don&#39;t think free</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.350" end="00:12:34.540" style="s2">radical scavenging is the best way to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.450" end="00:12:36.220" style="s2">in general because the body does a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.540" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">pretty good job of controlling free</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.220" end="00:12:40.780" style="s2">radicals and most people and the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:42.760" style="s2">who would benefit most from free radical</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.780" end="00:12:44.860" style="s2">scavengers are the really the couch</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.760" end="00:12:46.060" style="s2">potatoes that are just not really</p>
