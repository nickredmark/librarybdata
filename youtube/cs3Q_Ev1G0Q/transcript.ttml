<p begin="00:00:00.399" end="00:00:06.960" style="s2">all right and now you wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.160" end="00:00:08.639" style="s2">which linda to go around and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.960" end="00:00:10.960" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.639" end="00:00:13.040" style="s2">what we think the best foundation is for</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.960" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">starting a community</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.040" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">yes um so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">i guess everyone well most people</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">i feel um like a place to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:30.800" style="s2">organize um their their thoughts into</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:34.239" style="s2">like a place to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">um and a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.239" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">places will start with um</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">a line of bullet points or rules that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">um kind of govern how the whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">is run and just have a discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s even good to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">or not and what um</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">would be the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">uh have others kind of be joined</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:16.880" style="s2">together under some sort of common</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">umbrella or thoughts or principles you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.880" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">maybe just even a couple um words</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">or just an idea you know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">that would just be uh common amongst</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">so as i was thinking about this um</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">i was thinking that probably using</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">like rules would be uh not a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">because that that&#39;s kind of like could</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">be looked upon as like aggressive and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">you might be punished if you break them</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">so that probably wouldn&#39;t be a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">and um that kind of is how game a is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">situated</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">and it it it uh kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">gives this aura of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">you know like are you following the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">rules are you breaking the rules are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">good are you bad blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">so i kind of was feeling like more i</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">would like to just</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">be part of a community that kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">had like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">uh a philosophy for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">like um you know here is a place where</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">everyone you know uh the goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">live to live together in peace</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">and you know support uh happiness</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">amongst each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">and um work together</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">as cooperatively as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">like i think that would just be a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">nice and i feel like that would leave</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">like many different people i like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">whole variety of people around me</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">so i feel like that couldn&#39;t exclude</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">it it it could be people from all ages</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">all races all ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">could fit together under that and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t put too much pressure on are you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">doing this are you not doing this but</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">then again it kind of does in a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">but so you&#39;ve said in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">little um mission vision statement there</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">was a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">things in there right to work together</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">to promote happiness to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s helpful to know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">your top prior</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">your personal top priority is um i have</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">and i&#39;m like they&#39;re when i was writing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">it down it was um</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">resiliency like being in a place where i</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">know we can handle whatever storms come</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">eating we grow our own food we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">but in an interconnected way that my</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:56.159" style="s2">current community doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">are that there&#39;s a risk that comes with</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">intertwining your finances but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">also resiliency that comes with knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">that your food is is together right</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">every family for themselves and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">abandon ship when there&#39;s there&#39;s chaos</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">although that can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">part of it but just knowing that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">resiliency and the intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">knowing i don&#39;t want our finances 100</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">intertwined but i also don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">i want to know my food shelter basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">needs are met by that community</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">when stuff hits the fence so resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">the other one was authenticity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">that to me i do want that diverse group</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">but at a higher level i want people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">are authentic where i can show up and be</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">and they&#39;re able to be authentic and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:38.160" style="s2">know what conflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">comes from that you can&#39;t just like</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.160" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna be authentic</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">and hope that there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">conflict because there will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">and then my um my one thing i would form</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">a community around</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">i think people either have land and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">want to find people they have people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">they want to find land or they have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">mission right to start a healing center</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">and my um central thing around which i</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">want to start a community as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">technology cooperative because i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a great way to fund it</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s my purpose on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">and i want those things to find so a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">community around a technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">cooperative so that would be what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">have in common and then the values that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">i want are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">resiliency and and diversity slash</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">authenticity but they&#39;re not resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">and then that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">directly i can&#39;t have one without the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">if i have one yeah i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">higher prioritized than the other with</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">i just feel like i know that i would</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">like to be surrounded by people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">um living</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">peacefully with each other is important</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">to them you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t um i like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">com compromise and find solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">that everyone can be comfortable with so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">even though that doesn&#39;t always happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">like i try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">strive for that in my relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">i find that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">living with people if you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">look at the bigger picture and not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">well this is what i want but you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">look at the other person and see it from</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">their point of view</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">you know also trying to have like</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">and how am i going to benefit from this</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">thinking of others</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">as you think about yourself too</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">yeah it sounds like the golden rule</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">as you want to be treated yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">and i heard another one that was called</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">the platinum rule let&#39;s treat others how</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">they want to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s like okay step up from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">golden rule</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">um you know i i am interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">i haven&#39;t spent a lot of time thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">about my like ideal thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">shooting for so it&#39;s good to you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">hear what other ideas are out there and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">i guess the point is i haven&#39;t spent a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">lot of time on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">for myself um i&#39;ve had some good</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.839" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">short term in community and some bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">people are really messy that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">people are messy and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">difficult and so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">lately i&#39;ve kind of backed way off</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">from community because it hasn&#39;t gone so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">well for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">i think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">i have a better idea of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">kinds of principles that i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">are really important but i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">that main</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">like uh hey a tech community or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">farming community</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">or an off-grid community or</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">um a music community you know i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">have that specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">in mind um but i have more of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">uh the principles um</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">i talk about grace i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">being built in because</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">no matter how long you know somebody my</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">experience is</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">eventually someone&#39;s gonna let you down</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">whether they</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to or or they meant to or</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">you know people are messy and flawed um</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">so the good experiences i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">those are like core things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">always go back to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like hey well what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">doing here we are attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">give each other grace uh when we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">and so if a member does something</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">they you know had a bad moment did</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">something they regret</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">then the move is to see if they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">reconcile and see if</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">um something good can happen from it</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">whereas if that wasn&#39;t a core principle</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">it appears that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">people could go along and not forgive</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">and then there would cause a lot of rift</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">and a lot of tension</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">in a community but as a community or</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">community leader you wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:13.839" style="s2">say hey well let&#39;s go back to that thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">because i could be like i never signed</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.839" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">up to forgive people</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">like but that&#39;s where i think principles</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">whatever they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like hey well we can kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">back this is what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">um and that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a few different principles that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">are kind of like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">and more like character deeper things</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">that are not so specific i could add the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">forgiveness piece</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">to a bunch of different types of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">my thing is i haven&#39;t spent the time to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">like really dig into</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">what that is um so yeah that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">uh and i&#39;ll invite juan</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">to uh share</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:08.079" style="s2">yes in my case</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">i am part of a community so um</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.079" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">i can share with you what i was looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">the most important thing was</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">to find a community which</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">is builded by members who take care</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">of my independence of this community</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">so the idea in our community is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">that we want powerful members in a weak</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">and this means finally</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">we try to empower every new member</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">to be more and more independent from</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">this community</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">this is my main goal</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">by searching or founding a community</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">so i wanted so when people join your</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">community your goal is to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">not need the community</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">to get them as um resilience the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">as independent as possible so they know</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">how to grow their own food they know how</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">fix the solar panels they know how or is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">is that what</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">would you mean by independent from the</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">um you see a lot of communities and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">because the group of members</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">in our case when we buy a house or</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">i had this i was thinking because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">about to have this call</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">the difference between i&#39;ve asked this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">question to everyone in my community</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">and not everyone but um like who what</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">would you design a new community around</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">and the two answers i&#39;ve told the story</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">before the person who was vegan and was</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">they didn&#39;t want even though they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">militant vegan</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t want to community</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">around veganism and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">i believe that&#39;s because this vegan in</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">particular is a militant vegan and wants</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">to like</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">convert to other people wants to like</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">get in on those naughty meat-eaters and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">convince them to come vegan which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">very different than the christian guy</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:33.279" style="s2">who did not answer hey i can help all</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">the heathens come to christ</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.279" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">it was the opposite it was like no i</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">don&#39;t want a christian community because</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">what if i had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">conscience if i had a crisis of faith</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">and then i would lose my community and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">my church</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">i need to have even though i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">central to his life and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">in his you know mid-30s he&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:52.240" style="s2">to change over</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">i think is actually 40 anyway that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.240" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">the difference between needing</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">because it would clearly be more</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">peaceful to have a vegan community if</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">you wanted a vegan community right</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">instead of every meal needing it to like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">okay accommodate the vegans and figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">out like there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">needing</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">everyone to feel your way</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">after the fact right she&#39;s not creating</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">a world around her veganism because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">a central part of her life and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">gonna have a vegan community</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s no i wanted to i want to be with</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">and she didn&#39;t answer this i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">making assumptions but be with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">meat-eaters and the omnivores so that i</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">like guilt them into being vegan which</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">has never made a single person go vegan</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s something in that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">community where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">and game b and all of it and maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t the space</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">but like the people i would imagine i</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">would want if i wanted veganism in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:46.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">are the exact opposite of her right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">the people who who</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">naturally help people come over help</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">them eat healthier help them</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">like without guilting them into it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">those are the exact opposite people that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">are militant about things sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">we&#39;re out there like turning people off</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">of the beautiful life</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">um it sounds like the the word is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">because yeah i might have my certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">principles that i think are good and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">you know have if i have more of like an</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">open door community</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">i need to be extremely tolerant of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">people who have different values than me</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">and like i need to know sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">end and began for myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">and for a community um i could have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">um i mean some of my experience in</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">burning man there&#39;s communities that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">have such a huge range of tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">for um different lifestyles and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">different values</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">um that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">it&#39;s really cool but it attracts a</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">big variety of people um and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s just all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">examples one isn&#39;t neither you know</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">reminds me of some of the game b</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">uh stuff that i&#39;ve heard about when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">set something in motion</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">you leave open niches and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">pay attention to the niches that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">open and be like you know say are these</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:29.919" style="s2">niches that i want to leave</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">open and like evolution is going to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.919" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">place on whatever you set in motion</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re not aware of those so</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">if yeah if you start a community</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">are we at different meal types then</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">choosing to be a vegan in a non-vegan</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">about what that means long before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">in community because some of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">things you don&#39;t know until they arise</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh i didn&#39;t realize i was this</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">confronted by when people</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">if your if it&#39;s tolerance that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">holding to a higher esteem than that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">then it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">front and center right that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">vegan tolerant of mediated or immediate</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">intolerant veganism it&#39;s like word</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">tolerance and this is our main</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">our main food i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">uh communities and continuing to like</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">learn from all those um times in my life</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">you know has the chance to do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.840" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">yeah your your goals are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">important i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">even in some of the church communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve been a part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">they&#39;re they run the gamut they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:28.640" style="s2">widespread and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">some of them tend to be more like almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.640" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">with the vegan thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">uh you&#39;re mentioning we&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">uh church people here and we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">this church thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know how to handle folks</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">are exploring that or just showed up</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">because their life is falling apart or</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">um because we&#39;re all christians here</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s like a way to do it um i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">leave my opinions out of it um and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">the the church communities that are like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">well you know everybody&#39;s at a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">place in their life</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">and we&#39;re extremely tolerant of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">um you know whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">one of us christians or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">uh that does doesn&#39;t really seem to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">matter because we&#39;re all human beings</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">but the folks that started that</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">happen to have a certain world view but</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">they&#39;re like hey well our idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">is to have a bunch of people to work</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">together and do life with</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">um so i mean there&#39;s another example</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">that is maybe a little bit analogous</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">more complicated than the vegan thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:47.360" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">we want to do veganism with open door</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">tolerance to folk anyone who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">show up and hang out and learn</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">and try it or not or whatever and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">he could be like no we&#39;re only doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">this one thing um and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">something that juan mentioned was uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">something about trust</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">which made me think like another thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">on my list</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.440" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">has to do with authenticity and so like</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve had this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">uh doing specifically</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">trust building uh meetings you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">to start a community</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">and that authenticity thing you know you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">might spend</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">i i suppose i&#39;m just hypothesizing but</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:34.600" style="s2">be like we&#39;re going to spend the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">six or nine months just doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.600" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">and just getting to know one another</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">really well</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">um which could like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">weed out the sociopaths or um</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">something like that and like if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">something you expect to continue like</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">you know honesty was mentioned so if if</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">we&#39;re doing trust building</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">i should be able to go into difficult</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">um and wonderful but just brutally</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">honest</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">parts of my life and talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">candidly</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">and be received um and just heard</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">because if i&#39;m gonna be in community</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">long term with these people</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">then i need to continue to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">um and and just be honest hey i failed</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">at this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">or you know hey i dream about doing this</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">to be known</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">um both of those kinds of things i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">curious about</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">like what trust building um</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">looks like for uh juan and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">your experience with this</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">i&#39;d be interested to one in a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">yeah the trust in community like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">thinking of like a first date where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">throw all your</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">bad on the table like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">gonna love me love me for this versus</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a relationship long term</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">and living together there&#39;s a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">risk to showing up as your real self</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">because they could leave you over it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a bigger risk the longer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">together and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">that vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">long term versus short term before you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">start the community versus in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">community that i&#39;ve seen come up in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.840" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">since especially since i don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">there so yeah trust building</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">yeah i would say trust building</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">based on the idea that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">handled by communication i think the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">first skill is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">just to show the other side that you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">able to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">and as much as you show the other side</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">that you are able to communicate on</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">different levels</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">by using different channels</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.039" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">you open more doors</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">for communication</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">let&#39;s take the word you more</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:27:01.440" style="s2">um you are laughing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">uh if you try to establish a relation to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.440" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">another person because humor is a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">good vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">to transport even ugly or not so nice</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">messages between people so if you share</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">a kind of humor between people</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">um you give the other side</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">this opportunity to use this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">channel later the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.559" style="s2">to make it quick it&#39;s better to put the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">ugly</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.559" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">part on the on the table and in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">all your nice things you can share later</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">but to make it short and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">not wasting time of others</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">it is good to be authentic and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">to show you a weak side because</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">um one main reason for searching for</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">is that you already know your weak side</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.960" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">imagine to find other people who can</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">substitute this weak part</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">with a strong better different part</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">so it makes a lot of sense to come</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">together and to spend</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">time together i i have not</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">experienced that it needs um six months</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">or more</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">to to come to this point um</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">when i think about the last years here</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">in this house um if you spend</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">24 hours together if you work together</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">in a project if you cook together</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">if you share a bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">you you get some information about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">other person</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">and um i think after one two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">you already know more or less the scale</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">possible future relations</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">sometimes people develop some people</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">open up</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">after a certain time but if you stay for</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">a while</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">together you um</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">you you can make up your mind in in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">short time you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">need so much it&#39;s it&#39;s my experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">like you know when you get out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">relationship and whatever reason it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">that you got out of that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">you then look for a partner that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">exact opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">and then you like maximize for that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">quality and forgetting about all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">other good qualities that i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">had that maybe you&#39;re not maximizing for</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">but that is part of what community is as</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">well right like</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">like all those people were messy i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">like i need to live with people with ocd</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">like me and then you go and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">whoops now everything else falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">now i&#39;m the least now i&#39;m the most messy</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">person in the community</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:09.440" style="s2">and now they&#39;re all on my i&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">going to be one of the messiest i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.440" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">never going to be a clean person</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">but yeah that knowing knowing what your</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">your conflicts are and seeking out</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">community and then being in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">relationship like you&#39;re not just going</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">to leave every time there&#39;s a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">how do we work this out and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">how does that happen that&#39;s what one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">the reasons i love the idea of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">is that even if your community itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">issues in conflict that you can&#39;t deal</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">with you can outs like you can find</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">other people with better skills or</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">sometimes you do need a fresh set of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">eyes to kind of be more judge and jury</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">if that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">kind of thing is appropriate to be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">neutral third party but yeah but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">other resources available from a meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">than just a physical one</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">well i&#39;m being a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">introspective because i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">take some things i&#39;m learning and sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">of think about them a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">anyways um</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">i think he froze</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">no you&#39;re just really good at holding</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">your temple like that oh sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">no my brain froze i lost my train of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">thought so</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">um i was uh also thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">want versus need and how that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">um like when you want uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">to start something or you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">um because need is kind of it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">a sense of desperation like if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">needed something you needed it</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">and then there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">need to anxiety around it but when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">want to be a part of something</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">and you and you see the value there then</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">easier to approach um conflicts and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">different situations that happen with</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">a more like calm uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">mindset you&#39;re not in fight-or-flight</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">mode because what i need is going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">leave and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">you know so now i&#39;m in you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">this state of yeah like uh survival</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">but when you just want it you get you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">can think more</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">with your um uh logic</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">and problem solving skills</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s that would be uh good</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:09.279" style="s2">i i like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">uh in my community i would want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.279" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">be remaining at least to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">greater part independent than dependent</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">you know being dependent on something</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">kind of scares me</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">you know so i would like um</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">that if i if i maintain my independence</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">then i never truly</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">need from other people i just want</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">them so i don&#39;t know that&#39;s just what i</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">was thinking about during listening</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">while listening to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting thing to possibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">explore um</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">next time if we want a topic for next</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">time is that difference between um</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">that resiliency like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">independent then you can leave at any</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">time but that also means you&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">likely like</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a trade-off that i&#39;m seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">my community about kobit 19 where people</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">are dispersing because they can which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">totally valid you&#39;re allowed to right</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">and then what juan was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">earlier about having the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">he didn&#39;t really say like this but</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">having the rules written out right where</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re taking with you you know what it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">means to leave</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">so that you&#39;re free to leave so that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">know you&#39;re not starting from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">like making sure that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">we have the prenuptial agreement in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">place that if you leave you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">you&#39;re going with</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">non-barrier that you&#39;re free to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">because that is actually the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">for community that if</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">because if you you&#39;re forced to stay and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">they&#39;re forced to keep you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">that is the sense of tension that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">hard to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">to deal with and yeah this this topic</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">reminds me of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">uh people being responsible or</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">the community helping one another to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">achieve different types of wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">and like i i like the topic of what does</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">start or enter into a community out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">or what does it mean to start or enter a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">new community</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">out of um you know need or</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">desperation or that survival</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">mentality um which is very real and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">are are in that yet they still need</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">we&#39;re a society so we need one another</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">but like to what degree is someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">coming in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">how do you catch someone as a community</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">who&#39;s in survival mode or something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:40.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">um and the other thing that came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">was um</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">you know one sort of mentioned on oh you</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">might might not take six months to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:55.359" style="s2">to know someone hey if i spend</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">48 hours with them and it&#39;s quality time</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.359" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">then you know i can really get to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:01.280" style="s2">them well or whatever and you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">with different people maybe i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">um the other thing that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">is that um people also</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">change so you&#39;re in community</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">with um some people but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">should expect them to change their</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">hobbies might change a little bit their</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">interests might change because if people</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">are growing and learning and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">if you have kids i mean they&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">massively</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">adults aren&#39;t changing uh quite as bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">quite quite as much but you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">leave room for the individuals to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">change who they are as they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">and growing and exploring new things</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">in life and like that&#39;s related to how</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">community changes</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">so this is something i&#39;ve experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:52.079" style="s2">little bit in some burning man groups</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">that are like hey you know some people</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">getting nostalgic</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">and being like hey it used to be like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">this and now it&#39;s different and is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">good or bad and it&#39;s like well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">and when you have a community i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">talking about like an</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">art community that um you know is</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">is about you know more than 50 people</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">strong</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">um and it&#39;s going to change over time</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">one of the things i&#39;ve noticed is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">the community</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">itself you know it&#39;s made up of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">and you know over the past eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">the community has changed because some</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">come and go so you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">someone who was there for you know five</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">or six</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">years that brought their personality in</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">a certain style</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">and then life happens things change and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">and they moved on and that like</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">that kind of changed the flavor of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">community a little bit because they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">big personality</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean the community goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">away and new people come</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">in that are slightly different uh they</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">have a different personality and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost like the community is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">sum</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">total of all these different</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">personalities</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">that are there um and the personalities</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">are going to change as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">um the last roommate that i had uh he</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">lived here for</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">almost two years and um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">if i expected him to be the same person</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">that who he was when he moved in</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">that would be a strange expectation</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">because he&#39;s reading books and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">experiencing life and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">and he should be changing um</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">as things go on right</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">one of the um things in my head that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">working on</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">doing a video on at some point in time</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">is the idea of and i&#39;ve done several</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">videos on it actually is the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">normal curve</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">if anyone&#39;s familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">mathematically any any</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">any measurable trait and i assume any</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">measurable but non-measurable trait also</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">falls</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">along a normal curve so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">average that um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">part of our problem in society to make</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">things very binary you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">racist or you&#39;re not as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">spectrum of racism</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">but yeah that um to be as independent as</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">i can</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:04.720" style="s2">but also know that my strength is in our</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">that when we come together with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">pieces that we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">individually we&#39;re a better whole and if</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">you need people to be a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">parameter</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">that&#39;s fine to me but to be transparent</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">about that and transparent about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:20.800" style="s2">leaving process what happens you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.800" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">sliver it reminds me that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">different strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">and different gifts and uh different</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">ways that we serve i mean if you think</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">you&#39;re going to enter community and only</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">be taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">like that&#39;s just not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">uh in so many different ways um i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">one of my</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">experiences as someone who did notice</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.520" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">things like clutter in this in this um</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">type of artist community um i was more</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">of like a helper</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">like people had projects and i could</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">show up and be like what do you need</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">help with you know this is fun but i</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really like a starter of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">things um so i&#39;d help people with things</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">but we had workshops and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">um people would just leave their tools</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">everywhere and sawdust and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">since i didn&#39;t really have a project of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">my own i would just start sweeping the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">shop and organizing tools and like when</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">i showed up that&#39;s kind of like what i</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">noticed and you know some folks that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">wired differently</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">and they a little bit more chaotic they</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">could kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">live in the clutter and that was normal</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">for them kind of drove me like a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t drive me crazy but they</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">appreciated when i</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">cleaned up but it was just a way that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">could serve and feel like</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">i was you know valuable um</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">just yeah way i could i could help out</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">um and that i truly think that some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">the folks</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">that were way further on the artist</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">and they couldn&#39;t even do that if they</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">you know they would have to try very</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">hard and so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">symbiosis of you know these different</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">gifts coming together they&#39;d have to try</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">very hard</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">to like keep the workshop clean because</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">it was just not the way that they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">um you know wired they sort of lived in</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">this chaos</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s part of having that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">is knowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s accepted we clean up</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">after ourselves and some of us aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">capable and as long as</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:25.760" style="s2">people know right if you&#39;re the cleaner</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">and as long as you&#39;re not getting mad at</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.760" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">everyone because you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not keeping up to your standard</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">what goes wrong is</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:33.839" style="s2">if it goes into this space where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:37.119" style="s2">telling</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">other people too much how they</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.119" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">have to be um and telling them</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">how they you know this was a specific</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">so you know the parameters</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">are specific but in that case</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.480" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">me coming and being like hey you all</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">need to like</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:00.800" style="s2">clean this up more whatever it bothers</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">me wasn&#39;t really appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">but if it was something i could help</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">in that way i could uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">i could participate but it wasn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">changing someone else</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">do we want to um we&#39;re getting close to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">the end of the hour we want to pick a</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">versus coming in a place of wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">or i&#39;ve already established some</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:49.800" style="s2">dependence</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">whereas folks are more dependent or</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.800" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">interdependent</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">you know that comes to mind for me that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">was very complex for me to write down</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">resiliency versus like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">there that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">is but it&#39;s like just this with all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">subcategory</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">which is also how i end up doing it</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">which is why i&#39;m looking for someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">else to be like</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">resiliency interdependence versus</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">independence and then you can bring up</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">wholeness and survival right but does</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">interdependence dependence work for</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a topic but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">is that enticing to people who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">part of this conversation as well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">just that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">my contribution if someone else has like</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.400" style="s2">about what does it take to live in</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">community right what does it take to</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.800" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">my situation that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">just not to return to all all of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">i would like to add now</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.920" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">that i feel happy inside of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">community because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">charged by a kind of responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">the happiness of the other members</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">so i&#39;m quite happy if</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">somebody what i see</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">after a short time is more aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">the personality than</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">aspects of skills or</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">or development in handcraft or</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:58.319" style="s2">for thinking or or</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">changing substitution of values or</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">things like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:10.280" style="s2">i see in some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">the communities actually under the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.280" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">circumstances of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">kovite 19 a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">use this event</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">to gather some more energy</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">for for the community</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">especially for some leaders or members</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">or the hierarchy inside of the community</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">um to facilitate to facilitate their</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">their their goals</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good idea from</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">daniel to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">think about the relation between a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">member</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">and the community and um</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">this um was</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">on my journey to meet a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">communities in europe</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">also a big question how would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">my relation between me and the members</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">i i see and how would be my relation</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">me and this entity community</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">in our case it&#39;s quite difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">people to understand this because</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">we really try to crash the idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">that familia feliz is something like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">entity</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">so there is no association there is no</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">speaker for this association</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t complain that familia feliz is</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">doing something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s doing nothing if the dishes</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">are not clean</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not a question of the community</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">the person who was cooking or serving</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">or the last one in the kitchen and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">you have to deal with this person</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">so yeah i think this idea from daniel</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">to put this as a topic for the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">meeting is quite a good idea because</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">even for</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">people who are searching now for</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">community life</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">they should have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">answer before they start to search for</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">reminds me of even just people being</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">prepared of what they&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">even on like emotional resiliency i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">if i don&#39;t have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">to leave dirty dishes in the sink and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">have my roommate</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">confront me about that and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">have a bad emotional reaction i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole gamut of of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">that uh yeah folks need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s like a personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">like hey you can&#39;t react like that as</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">this is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">you know not a personal attack or you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">know however</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">so i just wanna there&#39;s it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">umbrella but interdependence versus</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">dependence</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">or wholeness versus survival mode</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">which one it&#39;s not a thumbs up vote for</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">one verse the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">wholeness versus survival isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">without being part of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">it maybe isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">as um i can you know what both kind of</p>
