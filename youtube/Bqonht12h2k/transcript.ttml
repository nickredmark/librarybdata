<p begin="00:00:06.839" end="00:00:12.900" style="s2">about a million things I&#39;d like to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.760" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">about it all great and so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.900" end="00:00:16.680" style="s2">have notes on what I want to make sure I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">say just in this comment because because</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.680" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">it&#39;s important and rather than add</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">anything I just want to acknowledge a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">few things and the first one is as sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:30.510" style="s2">as I am that we have this fork in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">road rather this unique time that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.290" end="00:00:40.290" style="s2">integrated one as sure as I am of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">I&#39;m also sure we&#39;re not going to make it</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.290" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">through if we don&#39;t change our</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">and relationship and eros in exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">kinds of ways you&#39;re talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">it&#39;s that important and I think the two</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">topics are totally related and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">been telling this universe story here</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:01.670" style="s2">together and it&#39;s a new universe story</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:04.860" style="s2">and we&#39;re wanting to tell one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.670" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">congruent and that makes sense and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:09.020" style="s2">gives us a vision of the future and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">shows us our place in it and it reclaims</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.020" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">meaning and aliveness in a really deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:15.090" style="s2">way and the part that you just shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">that you just added to everything we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.090" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">done so far really is the inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">inside of the story really is in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">heart of the story where the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">part of meaning and aliveness comes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">it&#39;s just there&#39;s just so much pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">for me arising listening to it and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">the thing that I really appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">most and what you just shared and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">everything that you share is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">unique self kind of insight as you share</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">it can seem at first like it&#39;s a mostly</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">human teaching that is really important</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">and critical at the human level and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">that&#39;s just one expression of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:54.210" style="s2">really a lens for a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:57.149" style="s2">ontology at the University and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.210" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">getting that there&#39;s a uniqueness to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">every emotion to every human attribute</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:03.689" style="s2">every quality that has something to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">offer universe that none of the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.689" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">ones do where the whole universe is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">missing without it and that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">this great reclaiming that is like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">essence of what I see you teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:14.010" style="s2">doing reclaiming</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.410" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">sexuality reclaiming</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.010" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">pleasure reclaiming eros even reclaiming</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:21.299" style="s2">judgment it&#39;s almost like every</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">everything that has a shadow side where</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.299" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">the shadows had had been so painful that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:26.159" style="s2">it was right for us to throw them out</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">until we knew how to do it better and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.159" end="00:02:28.709" style="s2">yet the light side of it the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:30.659" style="s2">universe is missing without it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.709" end="00:02:33.650" style="s2">obligation and so how to bring all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.659" end="00:02:37.709" style="s2">that together and synthesize it like</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.560" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">interesting to me that I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:17.010" style="s2">understand fully until I heard you speak</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">is the degree of pleasure that I receive</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.010" end="00:03:23.669" style="s2">from being part of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:28.349" style="s2">impulse and that&#39;s like a jump between</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.669" end="00:03:32.370" style="s2">the maybe and leaving out a few but how</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.349" end="00:03:37.489" style="s2">in the world did I jump to to feeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.370" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">that and experiencing the ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.489" end="00:03:43.859" style="s2">reality of the force of creation</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:47.129" style="s2">incarnate right so I would like to just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.859" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">say that maybe the all the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.129" end="00:03:52.349" style="s2">pleasure and if this is the sixth I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:55.169" style="s2">not sure what search level it is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.349" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">this level six should include all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.169" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">them that&#39;s right and I can see that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">you only emphasize any one of them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:05.879" style="s2">not enough but emphasizing six because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:08.940" style="s2">think six is what&#39;s needed in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.879" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">decade of life because if we don&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.940" end="00:04:13.199" style="s2">the social jump race like Daniel is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">saying if we don&#39;t go to that design</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.199" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">process and if we bring all the pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2">into it and see this as ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">pleasure yeah that I have felt but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:26.590" style="s2">need to get all the other levels so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.590" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">and get them along with me including</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">myself yeah my self so it&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.250" end="00:04:41.260" style="s2">design revolution right</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:43.270" style="s2">I mean to jump into the impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">creation in body and characterizing</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:48.850" style="s2">society than to get all these other</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:52.449" style="s2">levels of pleasure then we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.850" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">movement transform humanity because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.449" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">will all be there no no that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:05:01.690" style="s2">let&#39;s just play for a second so in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.290" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">principles of pleasure so one principle</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.690" end="00:05:07.510" style="s2">we saw was that if you remove one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:08.139" style="s2">levels then you get less pleasure from</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.510" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.139" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">that&#39;s one principle right so we looked</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">at kind of for example physical pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:17.500" style="s2">you know relational pleasure and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.880" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">pleasure and we just saw that you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.500" end="00:05:20.770" style="s2">vacation in Jamaica you know with a job</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.110" style="s2">I know works a bitch that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.770" end="00:05:24.699" style="s2">principle but there&#39;s a second principle</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.110" end="00:05:26.650" style="s2">which says there&#39;s no rate of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.699" end="00:05:28.510" style="s2">between them now let me add another</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.650" end="00:05:30.850" style="s2">principle which I like to call pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.510" end="00:05:33.160" style="s2">absolutism you have to beware of</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.340" end="00:06:22.900" style="s2">Marxism understood level six pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.500" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">but but again when you absolute eyes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.900" end="00:06:28.150" style="s2">pleasure and you ignore the other levels</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.650" style="s2">so for example you might ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.150" end="00:06:32.500" style="s2">irreducible dignity of the unique self</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.650" end="00:06:35.260" style="s2">as you can&#39;t kill 17,000,000 collective</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.500" end="00:06:37.900" style="s2">farmers right but but what was driving</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.260" end="00:06:39.940" style="s2">right the communist impulse was actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.900" end="00:06:40.320" style="s2">evolutionary pleasure was excess it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.940" end="00:06:42.540" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.320" end="00:06:44.870" style="s2">an impulse right but when you absolute</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.540" end="00:06:47.250" style="s2">eyes it you get destruction so actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.870" end="00:06:49.770" style="s2">the realization that evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.250" end="00:06:52.350" style="s2">pleasure is critical and was critical to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:06:56.670" style="s2">all three of us and holding all six</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.350" end="00:06:59.070" style="s2">right and we all six are valid and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.670" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">need to be in relationship to each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.070" end="00:07:03.510" style="s2">right so one of the principles is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:05.550" style="s2">balance that you need balance between</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.510" end="00:07:08.220" style="s2">the pleasures and the second pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.550" end="00:07:10.830" style="s2">out of balance right the system kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.220" end="00:07:13.770" style="s2">runs amok and so actually the way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.830" end="00:07:16.770" style="s2">actually chart our own emergence but is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:18.480" style="s2">to actually do a check of our pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.770" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">where am i you can actually do a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.480" end="00:07:23.190" style="s2">pleasure check where am I at all six and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:27.170" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that any here&#39;s the wild</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.190" end="00:07:30.090" style="s2">paradox any ethical acting out any</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.170" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">psychological breakdown right any kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.090" end="00:07:33.930" style="s2">of you know you know kind of something</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:35.610" style="s2">which is kind of a violation of what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.930" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">think your own higher self is you will</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.610" end="00:07:40.770" style="s2">always be able to trace back to a lack</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:42.780" style="s2">in either a depth or quality or</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.770" end="00:07:43.110" style="s2">dimension of one of the six levels of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.780" end="00:07:45.300" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.110" end="00:07:47.640" style="s2">so it actually emerges as the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.300" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">of what we usually think all breakdowns</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.640" end="00:07:51.990" style="s2">in ethics are based on failures and eros</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:53.580" style="s2">and pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.990" end="00:07:54.990" style="s2">mmm-hmm and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.580" end="00:07:56.220" style="s2">ethical principle that I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.990" end="00:07:58.170" style="s2">didn&#39;t have time to talk about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.220" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">but and that&#39;s the entire place this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.170" end="00:08:02.370" style="s2">going is paradoxically and I wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:04.350" style="s2">article that decade ago in a cover of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.370" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">tycoon magazine right it was called on</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.350" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">the erotic and the ethical people just</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:09.510" style="s2">read the title and they attacked it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:11.790" style="s2">even read the article it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.510" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">like what&#39;s he did right because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.790" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">people are so there&#39;s the Iraq and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:17.880" style="s2">there&#39;s the ethical know right and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:18.990" style="s2">the ethical breakdowns always happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.880" end="00:08:20.640" style="s2">when there&#39;s a failure of our awesome</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.990" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">pleasure and that just changes the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.640" end="00:08:22.620" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">you know I just want to tell a brief</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.620" end="00:08:27.260" style="s2">story when I was a citizen diplomat in</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:03.700" style="s2">oh my god this is what we thought the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.890" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">communist men would be right that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:06.820" style="s2">citizens from the united states that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:11.590" style="s2">were going over there at their own</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:14.770" style="s2">expense hmm freely of pleasure right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.590" end="00:09:17.860" style="s2">when he saw this and real if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.770" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">downfall in his face because they had</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.860" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">hoped that by getting rid of private</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:27.580" style="s2">property they would create to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:29.860" style="s2">impulse that the citizens of the US felt</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.790" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">exactly why I say I&#39;m so sure that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.730" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">is necessary not just important and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:44.650" style="s2">meaningful right necessary to make it as</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:47.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about the need for</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.650" end="00:09:49.270" style="s2">emergent self-governance and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.470" end="00:09:51.220" style="s2">imposed government doesn&#39;t work and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.270" end="00:09:53.410" style="s2">means governing our own life and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.220" end="00:09:55.090" style="s2">being able to interact in interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.410" end="00:09:56.440" style="s2">ways so functional independence and</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.440" end="00:09:59.770" style="s2">progressively wide rate levels and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.510" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.770" end="00:10:05.020" style="s2">sovereignty and pleasure that&#39;s so deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:06.700" style="s2">that and also between Communion and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.020" end="00:10:10.990" style="s2">pleasure right it&#39;s both both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.700" end="00:10:12.760" style="s2">it where if you know that as a social</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.990" end="00:10:16.330" style="s2">scientist and as an activist coming to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.760" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">this there&#39;s such interesting social</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.330" end="00:10:19.150" style="s2">science from the correlation of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:20.410" style="s2">violent a culture is with how sexually</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.150" end="00:10:21.910" style="s2">repressed they are right the more sexual</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.410" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">press the more violent and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.910" end="00:10:26.170" style="s2">because if you want to have a dominator</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:27.550" style="s2">culture or a few control of many to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.170" end="00:10:29.050" style="s2">things that are not good to them in you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.550" end="00:10:31.210" style="s2">have to have them not listen to what</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.210" end="00:10:34.690" style="s2">to them and so when you teach kids and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.070" end="00:10:35.950" style="s2">sex is such a big part of it but all</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.690" end="00:10:37.480" style="s2">kinds of pleasures when you teach them</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.910" end="00:12:44.230" style="s2">um and one of our you know bonus things</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">we&#39;ll do a section on sexuality but but</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:51.250" style="s2">in every dimension of being I mean last</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.640" end="00:12:53.290" style="s2">example what does a person cry out at a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.250" end="00:12:56.830" style="s2">moment of orgasm right cross-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.290" end="00:12:58.390" style="s2">issue right Oh God or in our Elohim or</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.830" end="00:13:00.640" style="s2">whatever version and the name the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.390" end="00:13:01.690" style="s2">person right and we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:03.190" style="s2">once right</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.690" end="00:13:04.810" style="s2">oh why saying the name of the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.190" end="00:13:06.850" style="s2">person in God at the same time strange</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.810" end="00:13:08.320" style="s2">thing to say and of course the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.850" end="00:13:10.360" style="s2">revelation is is that you realize in</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.320" end="00:13:12.340" style="s2">that moment that Oh God in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.360" end="00:13:14.380" style="s2">the other person are the same there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.340" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">difference right that that person&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.380" end="00:13:19.450" style="s2">their unique self is God uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:21.100" style="s2">expressing them and when you&#39;re fully</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.450" end="00:13:23.080" style="s2">self involved in that that&#39;s some point</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.100" end="00:13:24.970" style="s2">open you actually see with God&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.080" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">and you call it Oh God and name the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.970" end="00:13:28.870" style="s2">other person which is the same sacred</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:30.940" style="s2">text and it&#39;s a sacred text and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.870" end="00:13:32.410" style="s2">the Tantra trickster that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.940" end="00:13:34.030" style="s2">revealing kind of dust and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.410" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">kind of take this and make it source</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.030" end="00:13:38.580" style="s2">code of culture which has obligation</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:43.540" style="s2">commitment the whole thing it&#39;s exciting</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.580" end="00:13:46.210" style="s2">it&#39;s exciting yeah it&#39;s exciting I want</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.540" end="00:13:48.820" style="s2">to add to that as Marshall Rosenberg has</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.210" end="00:13:50.620" style="s2">this great quote that if you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.820" end="00:13:52.390" style="s2">a peacemaker you have to master conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.620" end="00:13:53.770" style="s2">you have to master going into it so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.390" end="00:13:55.240" style="s2">you can actually heal it and dress it</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.770" end="00:13:56.650" style="s2">and that means dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.240" end="00:13:58.120" style="s2">elephants in the living room that really</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.650" end="00:14:01.090" style="s2">mess stuff up if they don&#39;t get dealt</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.120" end="00:14:04.020" style="s2">with right and in the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.090" end="00:14:06.070" style="s2">movement the social design movement</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.020" end="00:14:07.450" style="s2">sexuality is such an elephant in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.070" end="00:14:08.680" style="s2">living room where it&#39;s easy okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.450" end="00:14:09.520" style="s2">talk about economics let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.680" end="00:14:11.590" style="s2">governance let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.520" end="00:14:13.240" style="s2">infrastructure that wasn&#39;t so taboo that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.590" end="00:14:14.710" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna get in trouble if we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.240" end="00:14:17.350" style="s2">it and then we&#39;ll be less credible in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.710" end="00:14:19.780" style="s2">these other areas and yet it&#39;s so core</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.350" end="00:14:21.370" style="s2">to I mean just getting we all got here</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.780" end="00:14:23.890" style="s2">that way right like it&#39;s one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.370" end="00:14:26.190" style="s2">things that is in common to to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.890" end="00:14:30.370" style="s2">that&#39;s so deeply moving and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.190" end="00:14:32.350" style="s2">if we don&#39;t actually address it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.370" end="00:14:33.940" style="s2">get to fix the other things and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.350" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">courage to do that and it&#39;s critical and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.940" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">so I&#39;m really happy that you&#39;re doing</p>
