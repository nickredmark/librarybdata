<p begin="00:01:36.310" end="00:01:41.720" style="s2">thanks Peter and thanks for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.140" end="00:01:44.840" style="s2">invitation to come into this virtual</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.720" end="00:01:46.910" style="s2">space and talk about these things so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.840" end="00:01:48.650" style="s2">am going to talk about fortitude or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.910" end="00:01:51.290" style="s2">the virtue of courage but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.650" end="00:01:54.650" style="s2">talking quite a bit about failure and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.290" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">failings and when when Peter approached</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.650" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">me about what topic I might want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:03.110" style="s2">about that&#39;s what came to mind right</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.040" end="00:02:06.790" style="s2">away because I think that we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.110" end="00:02:09.229" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about it enough in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.790" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">stoicism I know in our local group we we</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.229" end="00:02:13.940" style="s2">do every once in a while I&#39;ll bring up</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">where we went wrong and then we analyze</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.940" end="00:02:18.019" style="s2">it but there&#39;s you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:21.260" style="s2">not something that people are often</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.019" end="00:02:23.000" style="s2">happy to discuss and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.260" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">important because any mode of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.000" end="00:02:26.780" style="s2">intentional living and constants and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:27.830" style="s2">this one of those there&#39;s gonna be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.780" end="00:02:31.820" style="s2">of failings and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.830" end="00:02:33.950" style="s2">failures so stoicism helps us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">understand those and to wean ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.950" end="00:02:39.230" style="s2">away from dysfunctional approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">the inevitable failures that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.230" end="00:02:42.380" style="s2">the reason why I pick fortitude wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:44.300" style="s2">just because you know the alliteration</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.380" end="00:02:47.150" style="s2">the nice F sounds or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.300" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">it&#39;s because if we if we look at what</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.150" end="00:02:51.500" style="s2">the Stoics actually said about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:54.020" style="s2">virtue fortitude or courage it&#39;s broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.500" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">than just dealing with fears and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.020" end="00:02:59.030" style="s2">really does have some some resources</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:01.670" style="s2">there to help us deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.030" end="00:03:03.950" style="s2">inevitable failures that we right into</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.670" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">so this is gonna be kind of restricted</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.950" end="00:03:08.540" style="s2">in scope there&#39;s so much that could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:10.760" style="s2">said about this I think one could</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.540" end="00:03:12.230" style="s2">actually write a small book about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.760" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk and I&#39;ve already used</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.230" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">up probably a minute of the time this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.690" end="00:03:22.700" style="s2">gonna get on some some key points so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:26.770" style="s2">know I talked about why this this issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.700" end="00:03:31.130" style="s2">and I&#39;ll start by talking about a a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.770" end="00:03:32.870" style="s2">failing of mine that&#39;s also culminated</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.130" end="00:03:36.739" style="s2">in several failures for all of you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.870" end="00:03:38.510" style="s2">if you&#39;re not involved in academia all</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.739" end="00:03:41.300" style="s2">of your still you know quite aware that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.510" end="00:03:43.160" style="s2">everything has had to go online and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.300" end="00:03:45.380" style="s2">takes a lot of work and a lot of thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.160" end="00:03:50.180" style="s2">from this and I&#39;ve been teaching online</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.380" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">for eight years now so you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.180" end="00:03:54.650" style="s2">first got quarantined until they we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:57.470" style="s2">gonna extend Spring Break you better</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.650" end="00:03:59.269" style="s2">start shifting the classes online that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.470" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">first weekend I thought oh this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.269" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">perfect opportunity I can like get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:06.050" style="s2">of this work done right away and then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:08.840" style="s2">found myself as many of you probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.050" end="00:04:12.350" style="s2">have as well and this is a topic we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:14.030" style="s2">could talk about as well at the end you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.350" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">know feeling kind of unmotivated feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.030" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">kind of kind of blue and sad and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:22.040" style="s2">getting the things done that I I said I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:25.640" style="s2">would and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s both a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.040" end="00:04:27.290" style="s2">failure but it&#39;s also a failing and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.640" end="00:04:29.390" style="s2">talk about the difference between those</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.290" end="00:04:32.840" style="s2">in a bit because it&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.390" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">you know often do more often than I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.840" end="00:04:36.770" style="s2">like I create this great Google Calendar</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:38.390" style="s2">full of things that I&#39;m gonna do and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.770" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">then I don&#39;t actually get to them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.390" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:43.200" style="s2">revise it and take stock of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:45.180" style="s2">that the work didn&#39;t get done and who</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.200" end="00:04:47.730" style="s2">does it affect well it affects my</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:49.710" style="s2">students and it&#39;s not like I left them</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.730" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">in the lurch but I wanted to do all</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.710" end="00:04:53.670" style="s2">these different things that would use</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">their transition and keep them from</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.670" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">feeling anxious and I got maybe half of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.360" style="s2">them done you know on the scale that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">wanted so you know that&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.360" end="00:05:04.830" style="s2">classic instance I have some duties</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">towards these people that I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.830" end="00:05:11.070" style="s2">response with I know what the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.860" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">thing is to do and yet I find myself not</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.070" end="00:05:17.100" style="s2">getting all of the right thing done and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:20.700" style="s2">I think many of you can bring up similar</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.100" end="00:05:24.600" style="s2">instances in in your own just the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.700" end="00:05:27.630" style="s2">couple weeks the quarantine and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.600" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">staying at home and all the anxieties</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.630" end="00:05:33.290" style="s2">about koban 19 and the situation that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">we&#39;re in I think makes this even more</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.290" end="00:05:39.090" style="s2">important to talk about because as we</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:40.890" style="s2">put more stress on the systems that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.090" end="00:05:44.070" style="s2">live in and we put more stress upon</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.890" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">ourselves we&#39;re going to make more</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.070" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">mistakes we&#39;re going to shift into</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:53.340" style="s2">unhealthy ways of looking at things so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about failings and failures</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.340" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">we often use these words synonymously as</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:05:59.580" style="s2">if they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.580" end="00:06:03.750" style="s2">you know grammar police or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:06.870" style="s2">that about this but it is useful to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.750" end="00:06:10.050" style="s2">a distinction we often fail at things</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.870" end="00:06:12.930" style="s2">and we do so in determinate ways within</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.050" end="00:06:17.010" style="s2">situations that&#39;s a failure and it could</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.930" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">be minor it could be I forgot to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.010" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">the dog out and so the dog is is upset</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.620" end="00:06:23.580" style="s2">you know and maybe has an accident or</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:25.560" style="s2">something like that and then has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.580" end="00:06:27.060" style="s2">cleaned up and you know inconveniences</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.560" end="00:06:29.940" style="s2">people or it could be a really big thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.060" end="00:06:32.010" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t check into my classes all</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.940" end="00:06:33.960" style="s2">week and my students are wondering where</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.960" end="00:06:39.570" style="s2">do and and there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.660" end="00:06:43.200" style="s2">possibilities and then when we realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.570" end="00:06:44.830" style="s2">that we&#39;ve failed sometimes we realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.200" end="00:06:48.700" style="s2">that there&#39;s something more going</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.830" end="00:06:51.340" style="s2">we have failings there&#39;s there&#39;s things</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.340" end="00:06:57.930" style="s2">like them to be and you know our society</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.790" end="00:07:00.190" style="s2">is very good at giving us all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.930" end="00:07:01.990" style="s2">sometimes correct and very often</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.190" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">incorrect information about what our</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.990" end="00:07:07.270" style="s2">failings would be you might think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">the fashion industry and how it pushes a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.270" end="00:07:13.630" style="s2">certain not just you know coiffeur and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:16.750" style="s2">and you know set of clothes that should</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.630" end="00:07:18.580" style="s2">change every season but body types and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.750" end="00:07:21.460" style="s2">what we ought to be investing our time</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.580" end="00:07:23.410" style="s2">and attention into those those can make</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.460" end="00:07:27.040" style="s2">us think that we&#39;re fail that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.410" end="00:07:30.490" style="s2">failing when we&#39;re not really doing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.040" end="00:07:33.910" style="s2">so we can talk about that as well we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.490" end="00:07:36.730" style="s2">also see failings and failures in other</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.910" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">people and one of the things I think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.730" end="00:07:43.090" style="s2">can be on guard from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:46.230" style="s2">against is interpreting failures on</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.090" end="00:07:50.050" style="s2">people&#39;s part as automatically</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.230" end="00:07:53.290" style="s2">signifying failings on their part so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.050" end="00:07:55.180" style="s2">I you know neglect an email for a while</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.290" end="00:07:58.420" style="s2">and don&#39;t respond to it right away</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.180" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that that that failure</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.420" end="00:08:03.760" style="s2">is automatically because of a failing</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:05.590" style="s2">with me and not wanting to address</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.760" end="00:08:08.230" style="s2">people or being disrespectful or</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.590" end="00:08:09.640" style="s2">anything along those lines but you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.230" end="00:08:11.590" style="s2">we have to be on guard against that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.640" end="00:08:14.370" style="s2">because that&#39;s a natural tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.590" end="00:08:18.940" style="s2">read those things into other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.370" end="00:08:20.830" style="s2">behavior so in any as I was saying in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.940" end="00:08:23.260" style="s2">any path of intentional living and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.830" end="00:08:26.620" style="s2">personal development we really want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.260" end="00:08:29.410" style="s2">expect to fail very often when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.620" end="00:08:31.480" style="s2">starting it and you know I know just</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.410" end="00:08:33.340" style="s2">looking at the list of people here some</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.480" end="00:08:36.460" style="s2">of you have been practicing stoicism for</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.340" end="00:08:37.780" style="s2">quite a long time and even then all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.460" end="00:08:40.180" style="s2">those who can&#39;t then you can weigh in</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.780" end="00:08:43.420" style="s2">and say yeah we keep on failing as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.180" end="00:08:45.910" style="s2">but when you&#39;re first embracing some</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.420" end="00:08:49.090" style="s2">stomach principles and practices you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:50.590" style="s2">gonna fail all the time and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.090" end="00:08:53.910" style="s2">that&#39;s just part of the course it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.590" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">like learning a musical instrument or</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.910" end="00:08:57.850" style="s2">going to the gym and starting a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:08:59.620" style="s2">exercise routine you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.850" end="00:09:02.910" style="s2">it makes sense that that would happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.620" end="00:09:05.139" style="s2">and so you know dealing with failure</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.910" end="00:09:08.410" style="s2">productively is going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.139" end="00:09:10.870" style="s2">important for us and you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.410" end="00:09:12.639" style="s2">think about some of the ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.870" end="00:09:14.350" style="s2">fail and I came up with a list here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.639" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">just gonna like hit on some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.350" end="00:09:18.940" style="s2">general ways right some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:20.740" style="s2">cognitive we get mixed up in what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.940" end="00:09:23.139" style="s2">think or assume or we have incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.740" end="00:09:24.850" style="s2">ideas about things like mixing up what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.139" end="00:09:28.029" style="s2">in our control and what&#39;s what&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.850" end="00:09:32.290" style="s2">our control we make mistaken inferences</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.029" end="00:09:35.709" style="s2">we follow out automatic lines of thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.290" end="00:09:39.490" style="s2">processes or lines of reasoning that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.709" end="00:09:41.170" style="s2">mistaken sometimes we actually just sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.490" end="00:09:43.060" style="s2">of make a mistake almost like you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.170" end="00:09:44.410" style="s2">in mathematics would be lined up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.060" end="00:09:46.509" style="s2">the wrong number at the end we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.410" end="00:09:48.430" style="s2">quite sure how we got there we get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.509" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">wrong results but we do that with our</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.430" end="00:09:53.769" style="s2">reasoning as well but we also have</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:09:55.870" style="s2">effective ways in which we fail and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.769" end="00:09:57.910" style="s2">is where I think service ISM can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.870" end="00:09:59.889" style="s2">really helpful in telling us what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.910" end="00:10:01.750" style="s2">what we want to desire what we ought to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.889" end="00:10:05.620" style="s2">be averse to right</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.750" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">we often desire the wrong things or are</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.620" end="00:10:11.949" style="s2">averse to the wrong things or too much</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:16.149" style="s2">too little we direct our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.949" end="00:10:18.699" style="s2">towards the wrong objects sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.149" end="00:10:21.970" style="s2">act on them in ways that are not helpful</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.699" end="00:10:23.800" style="s2">for us or for others and we often do</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.970" end="00:10:26.199" style="s2">realize if we&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.800" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">ourselves in examining ourselves which</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.199" end="00:10:32.500" style="s2">is part of stoicism that we we should</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:34.060" style="s2">feel something better or different but</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.500" end="00:10:37.300" style="s2">don&#39;t then we feel that as a failure</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.060" end="00:10:40.060" style="s2">right on our on our part there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.300" end="00:10:42.699" style="s2">volitional modalities we we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.060" end="00:10:45.689" style="s2">choose the wrong things or commit to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.699" end="00:10:48.189" style="s2">wrong things the bad instead of the good</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.689" end="00:10:50.829" style="s2">and then afterwards we said what was I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.189" end="00:10:52.660" style="s2">thinking there we choose things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.829" end="00:10:54.519" style="s2">could be good but end up being bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.660" end="00:10:56.740" style="s2">because we don&#39;t pay close enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.519" end="00:10:59.019" style="s2">attention to what we&#39;re doing we start</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.740" end="00:11:01.540" style="s2">with a good intention but don&#39;t follow</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.019" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">through on it or we prioritize things in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.540" end="00:11:07.149" style="s2">a way that that gets in our own way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:10.029" style="s2">hinders us things Epictetus is term or</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.149" end="00:11:10.910" style="s2">sometimes we fail to fulfill the duties</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.910" end="00:11:16.370" style="s2">and that leads us into action sometimes</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.370" end="00:11:20.780" style="s2">through on it we don&#39;t check up to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.920" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">whether the results actually turned out</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.780" end="00:11:25.580" style="s2">the way that we assumed or you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:27.770" style="s2">things turn out differently than we</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.580" end="00:11:30.890" style="s2">intended because we we don&#39;t act in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.770" end="00:11:34.010" style="s2">pure vacuum we were within an entire</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.890" end="00:11:36.680" style="s2">matrix of causes that include other</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.010" end="00:11:39.830" style="s2">people and the universe itself and all</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.680" end="00:11:42.860" style="s2">of these these processes and so things</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.830" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">go astray and we have to stay on top of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:49.100" style="s2">that so those are all different ways in</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">which we might experience failure and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:52.940" style="s2">might you know when we bring the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:56.810" style="s2">stoicism into the mix in a way it kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.940" end="00:11:59.210" style="s2">of raises the bar so we hold ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.810" end="00:12:01.550" style="s2">to higher standards then we would have</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.210" end="00:12:03.710" style="s2">had we would have in the past when it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.550" end="00:12:05.750" style="s2">comes to our choices and actions and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.710" end="00:12:08.510" style="s2">thoughts and particularly to emotions</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.510" end="00:12:12.920" style="s2">entire life with anger that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.670" end="00:12:14.120" style="s2">how I got into studies over the first</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.120" end="00:12:20.090" style="s2">story I&#39;m and I&#39;ll be happy to share it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.310" end="00:12:23.390" style="s2">in the Q&amp;A if people want and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.090" end="00:12:26.150" style="s2">the Stoics are very zero-tolerance when</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.390" end="00:12:29.240" style="s2">it comes to ager and I can say I fail at</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.150" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">that probably not every single day but</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.240" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">pretty close and so you know when we we</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.020" style="s2">begin to hold ourselves to higher</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:39.740" style="s2">standards we become much more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.020" end="00:12:41.720" style="s2">of where we&#39;re failing we also do so and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.740" end="00:12:44.150" style="s2">I think this is a very helpful mental</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.150" end="00:12:49.640" style="s2">vices you know when we can give a name</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.640" end="00:12:55.070" style="s2">it&#39;s bad for a person to be and we can</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.440" end="00:13:05.780" style="s2">know we often fail when it comes to the</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.869" end="00:13:36.910" style="s2">of those relationships and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.839" end="00:13:38.319" style="s2">might say oh well that makes you know in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.910" end="00:13:40.089" style="s2">that case maybe we should get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.319" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">Stoicism it just makes us more miserable</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.089" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s not fulfilling its promise of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:47.769" style="s2">making us happier and you know we might</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:50.470" style="s2">want to think about the legendary sage</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.769" end="00:13:53.170" style="s2">of the fact that maybe some of you aim</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.470" end="00:13:56.040" style="s2">to be the sage I don&#39;t I&#39;m a Procope Don</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.170" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">and I intend to be that my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.040" end="00:14:00.339" style="s2">because that&#39;s good enough you know I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:02.170" style="s2">just want to get a bit better and a bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:05.019" style="s2">better just like Epictetus says hey I</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.170" end="00:14:08.110" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be Socrates it&#39;s enough if</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.019" end="00:14:10.449" style="s2">I just make some progress along way and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.110" end="00:14:12.339" style="s2">I think another thing that epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.449" end="00:14:13.990" style="s2">says is helpful in this all of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.339" end="00:14:16.629" style="s2">remember that the passage from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.990" end="00:14:19.240" style="s2">enchiridion about the beginner blames</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.629" end="00:14:22.089" style="s2">everybody except for themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.240" end="00:14:24.189" style="s2">and the person who&#39;s making some</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.089" end="00:14:26.470" style="s2">progress blames himself and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.189" end="00:14:28.449" style="s2">person who&#39;s actually made a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.470" end="00:14:30.610" style="s2">progress or understands things doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.449" end="00:14:33.339" style="s2">blame anybody and we use this as a class</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.610" end="00:14:35.860" style="s2">of a Qatari principle I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.339" end="00:14:38.439" style="s2">see this as a continuum instead you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.860" end="00:14:41.410" style="s2">as a process where we wean ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.439" end="00:14:44.050" style="s2">away from blaming other people and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.410" end="00:14:45.699" style="s2">start focusing more on what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.050" end="00:14:49.209" style="s2">change in ourselves and what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.699" end="00:14:51.759" style="s2">be you know sometimes hard on ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.209" end="00:14:54.040" style="s2">about and then eventually move away from</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.759" end="00:14:55.029" style="s2">that as well doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.040" end="00:14:57.459" style="s2">ever going to get there</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.029" end="00:14:59.050" style="s2">entirely and not blame anybody and be</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.459" end="00:15:02.910" style="s2">totally cool with everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:06.360" style="s2">going on maybe that&#39;s not not what we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.910" end="00:15:09.129" style="s2">another thing I wanted to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.360" end="00:15:11.529" style="s2">common mistakes that people make when</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.129" end="00:15:13.959" style="s2">they fail and how we can look at them</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.529" end="00:15:15.339" style="s2">from the stoic perspective and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.959" end="00:15:16.870" style="s2">looking at them from the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.339" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">perspective will happen more in the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.870" end="00:15:21.939" style="s2">but here&#39;s some common mistakes and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:23.470" style="s2">can add your own as well so the first</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.939" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">one is denying that there was any</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.470" end="00:15:27.910" style="s2">failure in the first place right it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:29.589" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen and then you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.910" end="00:15:31.809" style="s2">you are familiar with them the payoff</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.589" end="00:15:33.960" style="s2">well it didn&#39;t happen oh it did happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.809" end="00:15:37.620" style="s2">but I you know wasn&#39;t me</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.960" end="00:15:40.620" style="s2">was me but I didn&#39;t intend it oh I did</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.620" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">intend it but it really didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.620" end="00:15:44.010" style="s2">bad effect that that you&#39;re saying it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:45.990" style="s2">that you know all this minimizing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.010" end="00:15:47.190" style="s2">goes out that is not helpful at all</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.990" end="00:15:49.020" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.190" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">if we fail who we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.020" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">acknowledge that we did fail another big</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">problem that people launch themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:59.190" style="s2">into a rather set of problems and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">actually when I was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:04.950" style="s2">I realized this is a very common theme</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2">in sitcoms a person will fail at</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.950" end="00:16:11.010" style="s2">something and then they will try to fix</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:13.080" style="s2">it by any means they can and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.010" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t approach it attentively they</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.080" end="00:16:17.640" style="s2">don&#39;t approach it with proce okay as we</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:19.830" style="s2">would say in stoicism they&#39;re reacting</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.640" end="00:16:21.330" style="s2">immediately and the efforts that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.830" end="00:16:23.910" style="s2">make make it worse and worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.330" end="00:16:26.370" style="s2">worse until around the you know 28</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.910" end="00:16:29.339" style="s2">minute mark everything falls apart and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.370" end="00:16:31.020" style="s2">then we have a nice you know coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.339" end="00:16:34.410" style="s2">together and we learned a lesson sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.020" end="00:16:36.330" style="s2">thing well you know in real life this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.410" end="00:16:38.970" style="s2">this approach towards failure often</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.330" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pay off that way</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.970" end="00:16:44.279" style="s2">shifting responsibilities to others</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s another problematic way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.279" end="00:16:49.740" style="s2">dealing with failure we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.310" end="00:16:53.850" style="s2">deal with things that are our business</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.740" end="00:16:55.740" style="s2">the things that are up to us ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.850" end="00:16:57.660" style="s2">how we make things harder for others</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.740" end="00:17:00.690" style="s2">when we fail that&#39;s that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.660" end="00:17:02.940" style="s2">common thing as well and I think if</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.690" end="00:17:05.250" style="s2">we&#39;re Stoics we have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.940" end="00:17:06.569" style="s2">larger systems that were involved so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:09.179" style="s2">like you know for example if I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.569" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">show up until 20 minutes into this I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.179" end="00:17:13.949" style="s2">would be putting out however many people</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.870" style="s2">are I can&#39;t I can&#39;t tell exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.949" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">now helmet however many people were</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.870" end="00:17:21.209" style="s2">waiting for this right if I let if I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:22.709" style="s2">fail myself I let others down sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.209" end="00:17:26.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s a matter of justice and a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.709" end="00:17:28.340" style="s2">matter of duties another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.130" end="00:17:31.610" style="s2">often happens when people fail is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.340" end="00:17:34.170" style="s2">excessive emotional reactions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.610" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">sometimes this can be you know guilt or</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.170" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">shame sadness is a common one anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:42.200" style="s2">you know what if people think I&#39;m a bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:44.779" style="s2">person because of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.200" end="00:17:47.690" style="s2">some of the other ones that come up that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.779" end="00:17:48.169" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t experience but I know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.690" end="00:17:50.989" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.169" end="00:17:54.229" style="s2">frustration that leads to anger and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.989" end="00:17:55.399" style="s2">lashing out at others which generates</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.229" end="00:17:58.279" style="s2">yet another failure</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.399" end="00:18:00.409" style="s2">or even a desire and enjoyment and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.279" end="00:18:02.269" style="s2">seeing others fail so that least it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.409" end="00:18:06.679" style="s2">know detracts from from what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.269" end="00:18:08.929" style="s2">doing another another common mistake I</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.679" end="00:18:11.029" style="s2">think is being too concerned about what</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.929" end="00:18:15.799" style="s2">other people will think and not about</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.029" end="00:18:18.200" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually dealing with in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.799" end="00:18:20.989" style="s2">situation so how can we approach these</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.200" end="00:18:24.739" style="s2">things as a stoic I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.989" end="00:18:27.289" style="s2">most helpful principles is the dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.739" end="00:18:30.049" style="s2">of control you know thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.289" end="00:18:32.989" style="s2">is genuinely up to us and what isn&#39;t up</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.049" end="00:18:34.820" style="s2">to us and one thing that we definitely</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.989" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">don&#39;t control is whether we failed or</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.820" end="00:18:41.359" style="s2">not so you know once we fail that is set</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:43.369" style="s2">and that&#39;s there in the past and we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.359" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">tell whatever story as we want about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.369" end="00:18:47.960" style="s2">and we can reframe things in more</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:50.629" style="s2">productive ways but the thing happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.960" end="00:18:53.210" style="s2">and if it came from something within us</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.629" end="00:18:56.570" style="s2">a failure within us that&#39;s still there</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.210" end="00:18:58.249" style="s2">too and you know we can change how we</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.570" end="00:19:01.429" style="s2">approach it in the future but we really</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.249" end="00:19:04.549" style="s2">can&#39;t do much more than that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.429" end="00:19:06.590" style="s2">we will have failings and failures with</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.549" end="00:19:10.729" style="s2">respect to all sorts of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.590" end="00:19:13.489" style="s2">indifference and you know those in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.729" end="00:19:15.259" style="s2">do matter as Epictetus tells us the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.489" end="00:19:17.989" style="s2">things that are in difference like say</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.259" end="00:19:19.460" style="s2">money it doesn&#39;t have no value</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.989" end="00:19:21.470" style="s2">whatsoever it just doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.460" end="00:19:25.009" style="s2">value that a lot of people ascribe to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.470" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">and how we use it is important and is up</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.009" end="00:19:34.070" style="s2">to us so we can think about those those</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:36.229" style="s2">you know classifications prudence has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.070" end="00:19:38.659" style="s2">do with how we use indifference in large</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.229" end="00:19:42.499" style="s2">part same thing with justice the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.659" end="00:19:45.009" style="s2">thing with fortitude and we probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.499" end="00:19:47.269" style="s2">should try to work on our skills and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.009" end="00:19:48.590" style="s2">abilities that we call virtues it will</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.269" end="00:19:51.080" style="s2">help us deal well with these</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.590" end="00:19:52.100" style="s2">indifference so I think that&#39;s one key</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.080" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.100" end="00:19:59.090" style="s2">we look at what is in our control and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:01.970" style="s2">focus on a mat but we also try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.090" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">maintain some focus on what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.970" end="00:20:08.090" style="s2">absolutely control but can influence we</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:10.100" style="s2">should do that well another thing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.090" end="00:20:12.020" style="s2">being concerned about as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.100" end="00:20:15.410" style="s2">what other people make of our failures</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">and Marcus has a thing that he says at</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.410" end="00:20:18.919" style="s2">one point Epictetus I believe has</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:22.549" style="s2">another thing in Seneca has something</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.919" end="00:20:23.990" style="s2">similar where somebody&#39;s criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.549" end="00:20:26.090" style="s2">somebody else and they say well</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.990" end="00:20:28.309" style="s2">obviously you don&#39;t know me that well</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.090" end="00:20:29.690" style="s2">because if you did you know not only</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.309" end="00:20:31.909" style="s2">would you criticize me for this one</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.690" end="00:20:33.890" style="s2">thing over here that I fail that boy</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.909" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">you&#39;d see all these other things where</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.890" end="00:20:38.090" style="s2">I&#39;m screwing up as well and doing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.559" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">can kinda help you put things in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.090" end="00:20:41.090" style="s2">perspective I&#39;m not saying you can say</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">that to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.090" end="00:20:46.100" style="s2">but you can sort of say that to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:48.980" style="s2">in your mind and then maybe not feel as</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.100" end="00:20:50.770" style="s2">as bad about the single thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.980" end="00:20:54.710" style="s2">weighing upon you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.770" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">realism about success rates is also very</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.710" end="00:21:00.919" style="s2">important you know Socrates himself has</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:03.530" style="s2">that patinas tells us went around and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.919" end="00:21:05.620" style="s2">this is his divine mission in epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.530" end="00:21:08.179" style="s2">--is of you to go around and tell people</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.620" end="00:21:10.130" style="s2">focus on your soul don&#39;t worry so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.179" end="00:21:13.909" style="s2">on these other things and what was his</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.130" end="00:21:16.520" style="s2">success rate about one in a thousand so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.909" end="00:21:19.240" style="s2">if Socrates himself was not succeeding</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.520" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">all of the time maybe we need to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.240" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">downward depending on what it is our</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:26.690" style="s2">conception what success and failure are</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:29.780" style="s2">maybe some of the things that we think</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.690" end="00:21:31.580" style="s2">of as failures partly failures and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.780" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">could say well in that case we go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.580" end="00:21:35.570" style="s2">to the dichotomy of control all Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">could do is put the message out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.570" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">and you know in a very assertive way</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:43.909" style="s2">which got him killed eventually but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">up to the other people to take that into</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.909" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">account and that&#39;s not up to him we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:55.570" style="s2">also think about what we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:59.059" style="s2">failures as experiences experiences are</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.570" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">appearances fantasy I for christos ISM</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.059" end="00:22:02.929" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean that they have no</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.340" end="00:22:09.390" style="s2">is a system of appearances Epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.560" end="00:22:10.800" style="s2">tells us so we need to look at how</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.390" end="00:22:12.200" style="s2">things are connected with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.800" end="00:22:15.750" style="s2">whether we&#39;re getting them right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.200" end="00:22:18.150" style="s2">cognitively and effectively the last</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.750" end="00:22:20.130" style="s2">thing I would say you know that might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.150" end="00:22:23.820" style="s2">helpful from a stoic perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.130" end="00:22:27.510" style="s2">this is not just there in stoic advice</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.820" end="00:22:30.420" style="s2">but it runs throughout intentional modes</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.510" end="00:22:33.060" style="s2">of living is that we can&#39;t hope to fix</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.420" end="00:22:35.700" style="s2">everything at once if we do here if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.060" end="00:22:39.330" style="s2">discover failings in ourselves we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.700" end="00:22:41.070" style="s2">to work on them bit by bit so if I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.330" end="00:22:43.470" style="s2">know struggling to not drink you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.070" end="00:22:45.390" style="s2">two pots of coffee a day which I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.470" end="00:22:47.970" style="s2">going to change by the way oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.390" end="00:22:49.350" style="s2">that&#39;s my normal consumption there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.970" end="00:22:51.090" style="s2">there&#39;s other things I could focus on</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.350" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">more like you know what my students need</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.090" end="00:22:54.750" style="s2">for me but if I decided to make that my</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:22:56.250" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.750" end="00:22:59.310" style="s2">I probably shouldn&#39;t try to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.250" end="00:23:01.140" style="s2">everything else at the same time and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.310" end="00:23:04.350" style="s2">can remind ourselves what is the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.140" end="00:23:07.080" style="s2">stoic philosophy so the stock answers</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.350" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">are you dumb or Nia right good flow of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.080" end="00:23:11.370" style="s2">life and tranquility and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:13.800" style="s2">actually do that what does that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.370" end="00:23:15.420" style="s2">look like the Stoics tell us this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.800" end="00:23:19.230" style="s2">where we get to the Nitty Gritty of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.420" end="00:23:21.150" style="s2">then it means understanding and choosing</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.230" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">and actually doing the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.150" end="00:23:26.280" style="s2">supposed to do appropriate actions or</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:28.650" style="s2">duties they also tell us and epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.280" end="00:23:31.050" style="s2">it&#39;s like constantly stressing this that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.650" end="00:23:33.660" style="s2">the goal of the stomach life is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.050" end="00:23:36.390" style="s2">recognize where we are in conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.660" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">ourselves where we are contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.390" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">though Greek word for that is my</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">literally battle where we&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">ourselves and to work through that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">gradually untangling these knots that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:52.020" style="s2">have within ourselves they also think</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:53.970" style="s2">that we are truth seeking animals we</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.020" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">want to know reality we don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.970" end="00:23:59.610" style="s2">screwing up health it&#39;s that in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:01.350" style="s2">assessing things so we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.610" end="00:24:03.330" style="s2">realistic about the world and very</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.350" end="00:24:05.250" style="s2">realistic about ourselves that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.330" end="00:24:07.640" style="s2">seeing where we&#39;re we&#39;re failing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.250" end="00:24:09.900" style="s2">stoic philosophy is about a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.640" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">transformation of the person it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.900" end="00:24:14.280" style="s2">about an on/off switch where we learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.120" end="00:24:16.310" style="s2">some principles and now everything turns</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.280" end="00:24:18.800" style="s2">into happiness and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.310" end="00:24:20.360" style="s2">and tranquility instead we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.800" end="00:24:22.160" style="s2">some work so here&#39;s where we get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.360" end="00:24:24.140" style="s2">fortitude and I realize I&#39;m already</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.160" end="00:24:27.050" style="s2">going a little bit fine so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.140" end="00:24:27.920" style="s2">keep this fairly short so fortitude is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.050" end="00:24:31.160" style="s2">virtue right</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.920" end="00:24:33.290" style="s2">we often translated as courage in Latin</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.160" end="00:24:37.160" style="s2">it&#39;s fortitude fortitudo and in Greek</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.290" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s on delay and like the other for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.160" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">other three cardinal virtues</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:45.590" style="s2">it&#39;s an overarching basket of things so</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:47.810" style="s2">what does it encompass it does include</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.590" end="00:24:50.780" style="s2">the traditional notion of like dealing</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.810" end="00:24:54.550" style="s2">with fear for anxiety right being brave</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.780" end="00:24:58.100" style="s2">in the face of danger or stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.550" end="00:25:02.450" style="s2">but it encompasses more for the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.100" end="00:25:04.280" style="s2">so Cicero tells us in on duties that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.450" end="00:25:06.730" style="s2">fear is one of the emotions that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.280" end="00:25:10.100" style="s2">helps us to handle desire is another and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.730" end="00:25:13.310" style="s2">anger is another as well those all fall</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.100" end="00:25:15.830" style="s2">within the scope of this area&#39;s didymus</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.310" end="00:25:18.650" style="s2">who you know if you haven&#39;t checked him</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.830" end="00:25:21.160" style="s2">out he&#39;s worth he&#39;s worth taking a look</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.650" end="00:25:24.610" style="s2">at he gave this epitome of stoic ethics</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.160" end="00:25:28.010" style="s2">he talks about these five different</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.610" end="00:25:30.860" style="s2">aspects to courage or fortitude</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.010" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">so in Greek I&#39;ll give you the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.860" end="00:25:33.980" style="s2">terms and I&#39;ll tell you what they mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">and I&#39;ll give you his gloss on them</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.980" end="00:25:35.870" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t go much further than</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:38.870" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.870" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">so the first one is car Tyria and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.870" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">week we translate his perseverance but</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:46.370" style="s2">also as endurance depending on which</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:49.010" style="s2">translation you&#39;re looking at and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.370" end="00:25:50.840" style="s2">calls this the knowledge there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.010" end="00:25:52.310" style="s2">all types of knowledge a piston a but</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.840" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">they&#39;re not like just purely cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.310" end="00:25:57.800" style="s2">they&#39;re also you know with within our</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:26:00.110" style="s2">habits and and our feelings this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.800" end="00:26:01.910" style="s2">knowledge that that is ready to remain</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.110" end="00:26:06.460" style="s2">and what is right been rightly decided</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.910" end="00:26:09.320" style="s2">so when we&#39;ve decided we want to do X</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.460" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">perseverance helps us to do that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.320" end="00:26:13.700" style="s2">part of what it means to be courageous</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:15.530" style="s2">in this respect so being courageous</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.700" end="00:26:17.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be running into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.530" end="00:26:19.370" style="s2">burning building it could be actually</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.390" end="00:28:23.740" style="s2">you know we get reluctant sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.059" end="00:28:26.409" style="s2">encounter things or like yeah I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.740" end="00:28:27.880" style="s2">this great idea this intention and then</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.790" end="00:28:51.070" style="s2">about all these parts he doesn&#39;t use the</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.370" end="00:29:14.260" style="s2">our agency that we ought to have so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.620" end="00:29:16.450" style="s2">know this I think maybe it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.260" end="00:29:18.460" style="s2">like a little pep talk more than a deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.450" end="00:29:21.100" style="s2">analysis or anything like that but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.460" end="00:29:24.970" style="s2">gives you an idea about how we can use</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.100" end="00:29:28.030" style="s2">this this virtue fortitude to approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.970" end="00:29:30.220" style="s2">the inevitable failing failures that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.030" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">we see and then the failings within us</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.220" end="00:29:34.900" style="s2">that we want to work on the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:37.510" style="s2">I&#39;ll say is you know the stomach&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.900" end="00:29:39.430" style="s2">often portrayed as saying that virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.510" end="00:29:41.740" style="s2">just a kind of knowledge right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.430" end="00:29:45.430" style="s2">that&#39;s true they do think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.740" end="00:29:48.430" style="s2">cognitive side too it&#39;s not just you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.430" end="00:29:49.570" style="s2">know having an automatic response you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.430" end="00:29:51.370" style="s2">need to know what you&#39;re doing and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.570" end="00:29:53.790" style="s2">do need to think about it and you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.370" end="00:29:56.140" style="s2">need attentiveness</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.790" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">Epictetus talks about us is having the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.140" end="00:30:00.760" style="s2">virtues within us as sort of resources</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.540" end="00:30:03.430" style="s2">that we can draw upon and that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.760" end="00:30:05.830" style="s2">aspect to it these are all part of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.430" end="00:30:08.140" style="s2">nature if we choose to develop it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.830" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2">the other thing where the Stoics do line</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.140" end="00:30:12.940" style="s2">up with other virtue ethicists is their</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:15.220" style="s2">emphasis on if we want to actually have</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.940" end="00:30:17.110" style="s2">the virtues available to us if we want</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.220" end="00:30:19.480" style="s2">to have the fortitude we have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.110" end="00:30:22.660" style="s2">continually choose and practice and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.480" end="00:30:25.450" style="s2">leads to establishing new habits that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.660" end="00:30:27.370" style="s2">going to happen over time and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.450" end="00:30:30.340" style="s2">sort of a meta level here we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.370" end="00:30:32.200" style="s2">fail at that too and so we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.340" end="00:30:34.420" style="s2">willing to you know if we want to use</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.200" end="00:30:37.630" style="s2">more of the imagery like the wrestler</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.420" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">pick himself up dust himself off and get</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.630" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">back in the ring again and fortitude is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.160" style="s2">the virtue that helps us do that so</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.980" end="00:30:47.210" style="s2">fortitude develops itself in its own</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.160" end="00:30:49.010" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.210" end="00:30:50.900" style="s2">the last thing I&#39;ll close out I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.010" end="00:30:54.140" style="s2">saying well if you do this it gets</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.900" end="00:30:55.640" style="s2">better it gets easier I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.140" end="00:30:57.860" style="s2">from somebody who&#39;s gone a bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.640" end="00:30:59.630" style="s2">way and can see you know further on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.860" end="00:31:02.600" style="s2">horizon probably some of you are further</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.630" end="00:31:05.030" style="s2">along with that than I am but you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.600" end="00:31:07.790" style="s2">the message is you can do this you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.030" end="00:31:08.330" style="s2">deal with failings and failures and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.790" end="00:31:10.700" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.330" end="00:31:12.500" style="s2">it&#39;s in one respect it&#39;s okay to fail</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.700" end="00:31:13.730" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.500" end="00:31:16.370" style="s2">become okay with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.730" end="00:31:19.040" style="s2">obviously you&#39;d want to fail less but</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.370" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">you want to be quite realistic with</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.040" end="00:31:23.510" style="s2">yourself about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:26.060" style="s2">so fortitude is the thing that we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.510" end="00:31:29.510" style="s2">to focus on that that&#39;s that&#39;s my shape</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.060" end="00:31:33.260" style="s2">here so I&#39;ll open it up to Q&amp;A cool cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.510" end="00:31:35.780" style="s2">so if you have any questions write it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.260" end="00:31:37.520" style="s2">Greg in the chat box and I&#39;ll calling</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.780" end="00:31:39.620" style="s2">you Tony yourself or I&#39;ll read on your</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.520" end="00:31:42.560" style="s2">behalf and I&#39;ll warm up Greg right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.620" end="00:31:44.300" style="s2">with the question of my own or me well</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.560" end="00:31:46.820" style="s2">I&#39;ll share some thoughts and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.300" end="00:31:48.980" style="s2">we can tease out a question here yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.820" end="00:31:53.090" style="s2">what was salient is when you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.980" end="00:31:54.710" style="s2">the the sitcom thing because my wife and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.090" end="00:31:57.530" style="s2">I just finished watching the whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.710" end="00:32:00.440" style="s2">series of friends and I had a Jason</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.530" end="00:32:02.900" style="s2">thought similar to that that I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.440" end="00:32:04.310" style="s2">everyone freaking lies in every episode</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.900" end="00:32:05.810" style="s2">they&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.310" end="00:32:08.360" style="s2">same thing with signs are always lying</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.810" end="00:32:10.550" style="s2">and you&#39;re right the lying stems from</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.360" end="00:32:13.040" style="s2">some minor mistake or failure or</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.550" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">whatever and then they make it worse by</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.040" end="00:32:17.660" style="s2">lying right and if they were just being</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">upfront and forthright and truthful then</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.660" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be an episode essentially</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:25.310" style="s2">and what comes to mind is that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:27.710" style="s2">Hall had his take on wisdom is being in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.310" end="00:32:29.690" style="s2">right relationship with reality which</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.710" end="00:32:31.580" style="s2">could do another spin of like living in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.690" end="00:32:33.050" style="s2">accordance with nature and so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.580" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">thought came to mind like what is right</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.050" end="00:32:36.890" style="s2">relationship with failure you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:38.180" style="s2">similar what you&#39;re talking about so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.890" end="00:32:39.590" style="s2">just throw that out you if you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.180" end="00:32:42.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a helpful framework if anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.590" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">came to mind yeah and as I mentioned you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.860" end="00:32:48.020" style="s2">know the Stoics think of us as animals</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.110" end="00:32:49.700" style="s2">that have these sort of basic drives</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.020" end="00:32:51.740" style="s2">towards things and unlike the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.700" end="00:32:53.780" style="s2">we have a drive towards truth and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.740" end="00:32:55.370" style="s2">where the the virtual wisdom gets its</p>

<p begin="00:34:05.920" end="00:34:11.110" style="s2">being wise would be realizing among</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.660" end="00:34:17.620" style="s2">sort of story to mollify them but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:20.380" style="s2">you have to fix the relationship so now</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.620" end="00:34:22.270" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably you know in some</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.790" end="00:34:41.650" style="s2">people seems a relevant aspect in a time</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.620" end="00:34:54.670" style="s2">that in a number of different ways you</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.860" end="00:35:15.470" style="s2">Twitter is kind of</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.230" end="00:35:32.180" style="s2">oh you&#39;re totally mistaken about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.820" end="00:35:34.970" style="s2">this sort of thing and I think as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.180" end="00:35:37.340" style="s2">stoic you would you would want to think</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.970" end="00:35:41.510" style="s2">well is it really worth my time to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.340" end="00:35:43.640" style="s2">involved in this particular situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.510" end="00:35:47.630" style="s2">this particular tip now if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.640" end="00:35:49.460" style="s2">about people closer to us maybe those</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.630" end="00:35:52.370" style="s2">who we have responsibility for so like</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.460" end="00:35:55.430" style="s2">you know if my kids are doing something</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.370" end="00:35:57.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not to their benefit or might be</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.430" end="00:35:59.630" style="s2">harming others I probably should say</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.650" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">something to them about that and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:05.300" style="s2">even if I have any any sway in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:07.880" style="s2">situation because you know quite often</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.300" end="00:36:11.180" style="s2">kids are you know they really are their</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.880" end="00:36:13.310" style="s2">own thing their own little world try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.180" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">influence them and bring them towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.310" end="00:36:17.420" style="s2">what&#39;s good and we could say this maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:18.590" style="s2">you know you think about this I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.420" end="00:36:20.060" style="s2">thought about this before but you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.590" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">think about the concentric circles that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.060" end="00:36:23.780" style="s2">we talked about with here achlys and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">usually bring this up in terms of Winkie</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.430" end="00:36:36.590" style="s2">there&#39;s also that that more inner circle</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:39.380" style="s2">where we are more concerned with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.590" end="00:36:41.780" style="s2">and we probably in times like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.380" end="00:36:43.910" style="s2">probably should pay closer attention I</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.780" end="00:36:45.800" style="s2">need to focus for example on my students</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.910" end="00:36:49.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t need to really worry about what</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.490" end="00:36:53.810" style="s2">that they&#39;re they&#39;re doing seem a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.080" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">bit counterproductive I need to focus</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.810" end="00:37:00.460" style="s2">more on my tasks there will be some</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:11.630" style="s2">and you know the most we can do often is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.050" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">a day or screwing up here would be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.630" end="00:37:19.750" style="s2">better path but you know right now well</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.300" end="00:41:09.180" style="s2">cases it will mean not feeling fear and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.360" end="00:41:12.450" style="s2">this is where the cognitive side comes</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.180" end="00:41:15.060" style="s2">in if you understand that some things</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.450" end="00:41:17.550" style="s2">aren&#39;t really scary even though people</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.060" end="00:41:19.980" style="s2">say that they are or your first reaction</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.550" end="00:41:23.460" style="s2">is to think that they are you can you</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.980" end="00:41:25.230" style="s2">can avoid feeling fear but even even</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.460" end="00:41:26.730" style="s2">though the stomach philosophy or we will</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.190" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">but there will be some things that will</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.510" end="00:41:47.450" style="s2">be genuinely scary and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:50.700" style="s2">guess I&#39;m tempted to think that modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.450" end="00:41:54.510" style="s2">stoicism would acknowledge a wider range</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.700" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">of the Stoics had with what are called</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:03.030" style="s2">good emotional states and caution you LA</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:05.220" style="s2">baya is one of those and that&#39;s feeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.030" end="00:42:06.810" style="s2">fear when it&#39;s rational to feel fear I</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.220" end="00:42:10.020" style="s2">think maybe we would be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.810" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">more wide in our scope so you know for</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.020" end="00:42:14.849" style="s2">example my kids are down in Indiana</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.130" end="00:42:27.660" style="s2">concern for them and now does that have</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.220" end="00:42:29.700" style="s2">to look rise to the level of something</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.660" end="00:42:31.530" style="s2">where I&#39;m calling them up all the time</p>

<p begin="00:42:33.030" end="00:42:39.180" style="s2">like that right no itch that that would</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:41.640" style="s2">be clearly off base but exhibiting what</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.180" end="00:42:43.500" style="s2">the Stoics called caution you know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.640" end="00:42:45.180" style="s2">does make sense in a lot of cases and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.500" end="00:42:47.069" style="s2">you know so if we let&#39;s think of very</p>

<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.620" style="s2">because you&#39;ve realized this isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.670" end="00:44:41.290" style="s2">so I think we&#39;d have to pin down what</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.320" end="00:45:09.460" style="s2">is kind of an interesting take to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.320" end="00:45:11.110" style="s2">about particularly in terms of the how</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.019" end="00:46:45.549" style="s2">quarantine and social isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:49.179" style="s2">stuff like that we might be going on for</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.549" end="00:46:51.219" style="s2">months and months and months and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.179" end="00:46:53.140" style="s2">know the economy is going to look quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.219" end="00:46:54.939" style="s2">different when we&#39;re when we&#39;re finished</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.140" end="00:46:57.339" style="s2">with this there&#39;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.939" end="00:47:00.130" style="s2">you know my wife has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.339" end="00:47:01.929" style="s2">connections in the food and restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.130" end="00:47:03.789" style="s2">industry they&#39;re really hurting right</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.929" end="00:47:06.579" style="s2">now you know a lot of restaurants are</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.789" end="00:47:10.390" style="s2">going to go under and what&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.579" end="00:47:12.999" style="s2">left after we&#39;re done we&#39;ll have to see</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.390" end="00:47:14.529" style="s2">how how the whole industry is able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.999" end="00:47:16.150" style="s2">bounce back and then we say that whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.529" end="00:47:17.799" style="s2">industry I mean all these other people</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.150" end="00:47:22.150" style="s2">whose livelihoods are dependent upon it</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.799" end="00:47:25.390" style="s2">many people it&#39;s their entry-level jobs</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.150" end="00:47:27.519" style="s2">so you know I guess we&#39;ll see which</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.390" end="00:47:29.789" style="s2">systems are actually anti fragile as</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.519" end="00:47:29.789" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.190" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">stoic Dan and you had a question feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.250" end="00:47:41.460" style="s2">free to unmute yourself oh I think I</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:45.420" style="s2">might have to yeah yeah you can unmute</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.460" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">yourself now dan great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.420" end="00:47:50.610" style="s2">um earlier in your talk Greg you</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:54.060" style="s2">mentioned that Stoics have a zero</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.610" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">tolerance to anger and that&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.060" end="00:47:58.320" style="s2">the way I would describe it as well but</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:01.260" style="s2">just yesterday I was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.320" end="00:48:04.530" style="s2">Massimo talk on another call like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.260" end="00:48:07.470" style="s2">and he said that sometimes a stoic will</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.530" end="00:48:10.140" style="s2">need to show anger to snap someone into</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.470" end="00:48:12.660" style="s2">doing the right thing kind of like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.140" end="00:48:15.950" style="s2">rare oddity that we sometimes hear about</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.660" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">a buddhist teacher slapping his student</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.950" end="00:48:23.010" style="s2">so oh but massimo added that you should</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.140" style="s2">not feel anger inside you should only</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.010" end="00:48:27.090" style="s2">display it and this should be rare what</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.140" end="00:48:29.700" style="s2">do you think about that that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.090" end="00:48:32.300" style="s2">what Seneca said that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.700" end="00:48:35.880" style="s2">example in on anger of the judge who</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.300" end="00:48:37.770" style="s2">appears to be angry so displays you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.880" end="00:48:40.680" style="s2">they don&#39;t display anger in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.770" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">acting from anger within them they</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.680" end="00:48:45.120" style="s2">display the conventional appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:47.580" style="s2">anger like raising their voice and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.120" end="00:48:49.620" style="s2">know maybe like they make themself get</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.580" end="00:48:52.560" style="s2">red in the face or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.620" end="00:48:54.840" style="s2">we can imagine so that&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.560" end="00:48:57.030" style="s2">pretty straightforward there is actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.840" end="00:49:01.410" style="s2">a debate about going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.030" end="00:49:03.540" style="s2">well maybe the aristotelian who the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.410" end="00:49:05.580" style="s2">Stoics by the way misrepresented I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.540" end="00:49:07.260" style="s2">mention as well if we look at that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.580" end="00:49:09.660" style="s2">ancient you know tanks and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.260" end="00:49:11.790" style="s2">that a little bit on that this but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.660" end="00:49:13.860" style="s2">they were civilians were a bit right in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.790" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">thinking that anger would be needed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.860" end="00:49:20.750" style="s2">galvanize people to doing what&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.670" end="00:49:23.600" style="s2">you know on a larger scale in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.750" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">getting our politicians to take the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.600" end="00:49:30.840" style="s2">dangers to working-class people and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:34.700" style="s2">mean here&#39;s a great example here in</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.840" end="00:49:37.020" style="s2">Milwaukee we&#39;ve had ten deaths now and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:39.500" style="s2">all of them have been on the north side</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.020" end="00:49:42.530" style="s2">of Milwaukee at the poor neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.500" end="00:49:44.450" style="s2">so there&#39;s clearly you know some things</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.530" end="00:49:46.430" style="s2">that need to be attended to and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.450" end="00:49:48.740" style="s2">it you know could anger get the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.430" end="00:49:51.850" style="s2">politicians to pay more attention to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.740" end="00:49:56.330" style="s2">public health things yeah the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.850" end="00:49:58.370" style="s2">that when we use anger for activism like</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.330" end="00:50:00.080" style="s2">like Seneca and Aristotle point out</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.370" end="00:50:03.730" style="s2">anger gets away from you really easily</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.080" end="00:50:06.230" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a blunt instrument and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.730" end="00:50:08.600" style="s2">Seneca says anything that we could</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.230" end="00:50:10.340" style="s2">accomplish with anger we could</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.600" end="00:50:13.220" style="s2">accomplish just by following bright</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.340" end="00:50:17.090" style="s2">practical reasoning and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.220" end="00:50:19.370" style="s2">whether or not we can get mass movements</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.090" end="00:50:20.810" style="s2">going without it I don&#39;t know we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.370" end="00:50:23.600" style="s2">certainly as individuals act</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.810" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">appropriately without using anger so if</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.600" end="00:50:31.730" style="s2">I see my child being bullied anger could</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:34.540" style="s2">spur me to take a stand against that but</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.730" end="00:50:37.490" style="s2">it could also lead me to like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.540" end="00:50:39.290" style="s2">going over and punching the bullying</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.490" end="00:50:41.150" style="s2">kids dad in the face or something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.290" end="00:50:43.940" style="s2">that and we don&#39;t want those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.150" end="00:50:45.500" style="s2">excessive reaction so anger is anger is</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.940" end="00:50:47.360" style="s2">always kind of dangerous even if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.500" end="00:50:49.340" style="s2">think a little bit could be okay if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.360" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">want to use that beam we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.340" end="00:50:53.480" style="s2">little bit of anger as a treat sometime</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:59.000" style="s2">no you know it&#39;s still kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.480" end="00:51:03.560" style="s2">dangerous to do it okay so we have time</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.000" end="00:51:06.020" style="s2">for one more question okay let&#39;s do this</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.560" end="00:51:10.100" style="s2">one so this is from Greg Lopez our</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.020" end="00:51:11.960" style="s2">friend from New York so epictetus asked</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.100" end="00:51:14.420" style="s2">us to transfer aversions from external</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.960" end="00:51:17.030" style="s2">x&#39; to our internal state what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.420" end="00:51:19.790" style="s2">balance of blaming yourself without also</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.030" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">inflaming secondary passions about how</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.790" end="00:51:25.430" style="s2">you have a failing can you give an</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:27.650" style="s2">example of how you do it okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.430" end="00:51:29.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a good one and and yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.650" end="00:51:32.090" style="s2">he does in the enchiridion suggests</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.990" end="00:51:35.180" style="s2">transferring aversions entirely from</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.090" end="00:51:36.820" style="s2">from externals I think some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.180" end="00:51:39.830" style="s2">that he says in the discourse is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.820" end="00:51:41.600" style="s2">modifies that but let&#39;s say that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.830" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">actually doing this so we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.600" end="00:51:48.950" style="s2">focus entirely inward on our own and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:51.470" style="s2">couldn&#39;t look at it as failings right so</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.950" end="00:51:53.810" style="s2">we should be averse to being unless</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.470" end="00:51:55.910" style="s2">let&#39;s use it in terms of the virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.810" end="00:51:57.640" style="s2">right let&#39;s say we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.910" end="00:52:00.770" style="s2">realize that we&#39;re a little greedy and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.640" end="00:52:02.770" style="s2">that means that we want to take more</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.770" end="00:52:05.150" style="s2">than our fair share of things which then</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.770" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">leaves other people in the lurch it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.150" end="00:52:09.230" style="s2">could be like toilet paper for example</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:10.190" style="s2">right Hawaiian hurting in this crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.230" end="00:52:12.109" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s been happening in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.190" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">Canada but it&#39;s a big problem here in</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.109" end="00:52:16.309" style="s2">the States for some reason it&#39;s an only</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">crisis where we&#39;ve actually seen this</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.309" end="00:52:23.180" style="s2">this weird behavior with toilet paper so</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">you know you you you realize that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.180" end="00:52:28.010" style="s2">getting caught up in the hysteria about</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:30.049" style="s2">how we better get out and get as many</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.010" end="00:52:32.690" style="s2">rolls as possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.049" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">now you instead of being averse to not</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.690" end="00:52:36.440" style="s2">having toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:38.150" style="s2">if we&#39;re following you know potatoes</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.440" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">they&#39;d be averse to being the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.150" end="00:52:43.609" style="s2">jerk who goes out and and takes what</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:45.740" style="s2">other people need and hoards it up and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.609" end="00:52:47.630" style="s2">then now that would require us to like</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.740" end="00:52:49.700" style="s2">look at me what&#39;s going on with me</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.630" end="00:52:51.349" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with me that I do this sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.700" end="00:52:53.690" style="s2">of thing and now we start to carry out</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.349" end="00:52:57.170" style="s2">some analysis and so there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.690" end="00:52:58.460" style="s2">what&#39;s going to help us doing that is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.170" end="00:53:00.829" style="s2">like you know beating our breasts and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.460" end="00:53:03.049" style="s2">say may I cold but no that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.829" end="00:53:04.460" style="s2">particularly productive as a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.049" end="00:53:06.920" style="s2">fact some people do that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.460" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">precisely so they don&#39;t have to engage</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.920" end="00:53:12.200" style="s2">in self analysis they feel like they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:14.839" style="s2">gotten himself off of the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.200" end="00:53:16.130" style="s2">the charge that they were involved in</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.839" end="00:53:19.309" style="s2">before we&#39;d have to actually look well</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.130" end="00:53:22.039" style="s2">why am I so concerned about having this</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.309" end="00:53:24.500" style="s2">one commodity what am I afraid of what</p>

<p begin="00:53:24.500" end="00:53:29.750" style="s2">engaging in introspection and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.170" end="00:53:34.730" style="s2">using sort of stoic categories to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.750" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">that now how would we avoid not blaming</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.730" end="00:53:39.079" style="s2">ourselves in other ways there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:41.089" style="s2">blaming yourself like getting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.079" end="00:53:43.250" style="s2">off the hook for doing that which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.089" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">just a show but what about actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.250" end="00:53:49.880" style="s2">feeling oh I&#39;m a really bad person for</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:51.770" style="s2">doing this that&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.880" end="00:53:54.109" style="s2">particularly productive either how do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.770" end="00:53:57.020" style="s2">how do we avoid that we could say to or</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.109" end="00:54:01.880" style="s2">sell things like well you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.020" end="00:54:03.829" style="s2">screwed up and my screwing up makes</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.320" end="00:54:12.450" style="s2">to move away from this but I don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.450" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">to to get past this or there might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.210" end="00:54:19.950" style="s2">other emotions to like anger directed at</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:22.140" style="s2">other people and all those those other</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.950" end="00:54:24.510" style="s2">people who made me do this no the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.140" end="00:54:26.100" style="s2">people didn&#39;t make you do that you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.510" end="00:54:28.140" style="s2">know you have a prior ASIS you have your</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.100" end="00:54:30.170" style="s2">own faculty of choice you decided to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.140" end="00:54:36.120" style="s2">allow yourself to get caught up in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.170" end="00:54:40.890" style="s2">toilet paper hoarding hysteria so can I</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.120" end="00:54:43.320" style="s2">give an example of how I do it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.890" end="00:54:45.090" style="s2">hopefully the toilet paper one gives an</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.320" end="00:54:47.400" style="s2">example but and could we think about</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.090" end="00:54:51.330" style="s2">other ways that aren&#39;t quite so silly</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.400" end="00:54:52.620" style="s2">that we can do this and other secondary</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.330" end="00:54:56.280" style="s2">passions</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.620" end="00:54:58.890" style="s2">you know maybe so one interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.280" end="00:55:01.410" style="s2">and this is where we move to where</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.890" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">stoicism and existentialism could</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.410" end="00:55:06.900" style="s2">overlap if you think about anxiety the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:11.070" style="s2">way that existentialist interpret</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.900" end="00:55:13.410" style="s2">anxiety in many cases is a an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.070" end="00:55:15.600" style="s2">of our own freedom that realizes that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.410" end="00:55:17.070" style="s2">could screw up we could screw up in ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.600" end="00:55:18.540" style="s2">that would be catastrophic and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.070" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">Kierkegaard has the example of the guy</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.540" end="00:55:24.660" style="s2">who stands at the edge of the cliff and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">feels anxiety he knows he&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.660" end="00:55:27.810" style="s2">throw himself off because it would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:29.340" style="s2">stupid to do but you never know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.810" end="00:55:32.700" style="s2">maybe I would do that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.340" end="00:55:36.540" style="s2">right and I don&#39;t think that Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.700" end="00:55:40.320" style="s2">would be immune to that we are conscious</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.540" end="00:55:42.690" style="s2">of our own freedom but if we understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.320" end="00:55:45.150" style="s2">that dynamic there and we recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.690" end="00:55:46.980" style="s2">emotions as they&#39;re coming up and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.150" end="00:55:49.980" style="s2">what they involve the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.980" end="00:55:53.490" style="s2">judgments that they they imply we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.980" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">sort of short-circuit them and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.490" end="00:55:59.970" style="s2">won&#39;t go away entirely most likely I</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:56:01.890" style="s2">don&#39;t they don&#39;t for me but we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.970" end="00:56:03.960" style="s2">them from having the deciding voice and</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.890" end="00:56:06.420" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.960" end="00:56:08.850" style="s2">they&#39;re not influencing the pro&#39; a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.420" end="00:56:10.560" style="s2">racist the Faculty of choice or the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.850" end="00:56:15.260" style="s2">ruling principle if you like you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.560" end="00:56:15.260" style="s2">the other term for that hegemony cone</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.540" end="00:56:23.610" style="s2">does that that address it&#39;s officially a</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.090" end="00:56:52.800" style="s2">inquire into stone but we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.550" end="00:56:54.420" style="s2">to develop an ecology of practices where</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.800" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">we can kind of like build this muscle of</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.420" end="00:56:57.810" style="s2">fortitude and this is a collective we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">gonna source the collective intelligence</p>
