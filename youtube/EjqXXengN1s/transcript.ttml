<p begin="00:01:43.430" end="00:01:48.380" style="s2">there&#39;s legislative power behind them so</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.380" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">like these made-up words Z and xur and</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.970" end="00:02:21.430" style="s2">my finger on a nerve</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.819" end="00:02:23.530" style="s2">as time passed many of those who flocked</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.530" end="00:02:28.799" style="s2">correctness became hooked by his message</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.170" end="00:02:31.510" style="s2">of transformation and transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.799" end="00:02:39.730" style="s2">began calling him one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.510" end="00:02:41.590" style="s2">profound thinkers of the time as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.730" end="00:02:43.870" style="s2">journalist and filmmaker of a TV</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.590" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">networks like channel 4 in the BBC I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.870" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">trained to be skeptical of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">grand claims but over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">months of listening to his lectures I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">become convinced that what he is saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">is that significant which is why I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.829" style="s2">come all the way to Toronto to interview</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:05.709" style="s2">him Peterson has been studying belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.829" end="00:03:07.959" style="s2">systems his whole life and how the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.709" end="00:03:11.410" style="s2">utopian ideas can create the worst</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.959" end="00:03:13.600" style="s2">outcomes and he&#39;s concluded that only</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.410" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">appreciation and integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.600" end="00:03:18.209" style="s2">great ideas of the past would protect us</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:20.530" style="s2">from the same things happening again</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.209" end="00:03:22.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been surprised that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:23.829" style="s2">been able to teach what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.120" end="00:03:26.019" style="s2">teaching in the universities because</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.829" end="00:03:28.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve always regarded it as crazily</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.019" end="00:03:31.510" style="s2">radical in a sense you know it&#39;s crazily</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.930" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">radical in a conservative way well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.510" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to make of that your</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:37.209" style="s2">teaching is crazy radical in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">conservative way yeah I mean it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.209" end="00:03:41.139" style="s2">conservative way because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">the past is not only has value its we</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.139" end="00:03:44.829" style="s2">cannot live without the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:46.870" style="s2">the past no more than you can live as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.829" end="00:03:49.329" style="s2">individual without integrating your past</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.870" end="00:03:55.049" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re historical creatures right</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.329" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">and and we without if we&#39;re not united</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:04:01.629" style="s2">can&#39;t consciously with the past then</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:05.470" style="s2">were divided internally and socially and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.629" end="00:04:06.550" style="s2">that has consequences so some of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.470" end="00:04:07.960" style="s2">are playing it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.550" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">so in the political divisions in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.960" end="00:04:13.990" style="s2">current world but the consequences can</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:16.030" style="s2">be fatal his fascination with the nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.990" end="00:04:18.370" style="s2">of belief system started when he was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.030" end="00:04:20.620" style="s2">young man haunted by the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.370" end="00:04:25.330" style="s2">nuclear annihilation during the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.620" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">I was trying to solve this terrible</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.330" end="00:04:31.630" style="s2">puzzle that confronted me for and many</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:33.340" style="s2">other people about how it was that human</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.630" end="00:04:35.800" style="s2">beings got themselves in such a tangle</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:38.230" style="s2">about what they believed such a tangle</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.800" end="00:04:39.820" style="s2">that we were pointing the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.230" end="00:04:44.710" style="s2">weapons of destruction at one another</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:46.540" style="s2">which by the way we are still doing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.710" end="00:04:48.820" style="s2">I thought okay well I understand that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.540" end="00:04:51.430" style="s2">need their belief systems they orient us</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.820" end="00:04:53.710" style="s2">and that means there will be conflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:55.060" style="s2">between belief systems and that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.710" end="00:04:57.480" style="s2">catastrophe and that&#39;s being played out</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.060" end="00:05:00.700" style="s2">everywhere again in very many ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.480" end="00:05:02.410" style="s2">what&#39;s the solution to that well one</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.700" end="00:05:05.740" style="s2">possibility is there&#39;s no solution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.410" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">just mayhem all the way around could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.740" end="00:05:10.360" style="s2">the case but it seemed to me as I delved</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:12.540" style="s2">into it that the proper solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.360" end="00:05:15.550" style="s2">was to live properly</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.540" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">he believes the answers for how to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.550" end="00:05:21.070" style="s2">properly are all around us if we look</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">carefully the artists get there before</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.070" end="00:05:25.630" style="s2">the philosophers long before the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:28.750" style="s2">philosophers the dramatists get there</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.630" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">way before the artists even and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.750" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">figured it out we represented it in art</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:35.760" style="s2">and literature and music and drama and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">then we&#39;re on the cusp so to speak of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.760" end="00:05:41.770" style="s2">understanding it in a fully articulated</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:44.380" style="s2">manner and not a moment too soon so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.770" end="00:05:46.810" style="s2">is that idea basically that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.380" end="00:05:49.150" style="s2">hidden story of transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.810" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">transcendence and it&#39;s encoded in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.150" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">mythology in our religion in our biology</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:05:58.030" style="s2">and in our actions Petersen is reviving</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:00.550" style="s2">the thought of Carl Jung the renegade</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.030" end="00:06:02.890" style="s2">psychologist who delve deeply into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.550" end="00:06:05.980" style="s2">human subconscious to develop the theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.890" end="00:06:08.860" style="s2">of archetypes Universal patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.980" end="00:06:11.620" style="s2">being such as the Divine Mother</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">unconscious the way it looks to me is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.720" end="00:06:21.580" style="s2">that we embody a lot of information in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:23.050" style="s2">our action and our action has developed</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.580" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">as a consequence of imitating other</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.050" end="00:06:27.460" style="s2">people and not only the people the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:28.840" style="s2">people around us but of course the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.460" end="00:06:30.280" style="s2">people around us imitated the people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.840" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">came before them and those people in</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:37.660" style="s2">and so on so far back that it&#39;s as far</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.410" end="00:06:39.910" style="s2">back as you can go and so you embody</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.660" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">these patterns of behavior that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.910" end="00:06:43.660" style="s2">extremely informative that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:45.100" style="s2">understand that are a consequence of</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.100" end="00:06:50.110" style="s2">centuries and then those patterns can</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.770" end="00:06:52.930" style="s2">become manifest as figures of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.110" end="00:06:55.510" style="s2">imagination and those figures of</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.080" end="00:08:00.790" style="s2">I think perhaps probable that nothing</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.320" end="00:09:04.030" style="s2">a conscious relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:06.280" style="s2">archetypes there&#39;s no way if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.030" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">then you&#39;re susceptible to possession</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:13.960" style="s2">and no wonder well you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:16.530" style="s2">axioms so the run yeah seems are the</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.530" end="00:09:21.820" style="s2">you see a certain axis biological</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.850" end="00:09:24.280" style="s2">structures there at least that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.820" end="00:09:28.150" style="s2">they&#39;re preexisting they&#39;re pre-existing</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.040" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">about it is that you know that the peer</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.020" end="00:09:36.460" style="s2">empiricist thinks that you get all your</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:39.430" style="s2">information from the outside world right</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.460" end="00:09:41.380" style="s2">but that&#39;s not true because you bring on</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:10:01.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t easy so you have the snake you</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.150" style="s2">so that can summarize the language</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.590" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">instinct so yeah that&#39;s right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.150" end="00:10:20.470" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:22.600" style="s2">like the archetypes are manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.470" end="00:10:24.490" style="s2">of the universal grammar grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:26.020" style="s2">emotion and motivation that&#39;s a good way</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.490" end="00:10:27.670" style="s2">of thinking about it now they may be</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.670" end="00:10:33.030" style="s2">these are some things we have to recover</p>

<p begin="00:10:33.030" end="00:10:51.480" style="s2">the idea of transcendental truth itself</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.440" end="00:14:54.069" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the ultimate level of</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.069" end="00:14:58.389" style="s2">hypothesis that extends to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.019" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">to Buddha as well the hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.389" end="00:15:03.130" style="s2">there has been one or two individuals</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:04.899" style="s2">who managed that and that in their</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.230" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">completely into alignment I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.019" end="00:15:21.970" style="s2">intimations of what that might mean we</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:24.069" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the world very well we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.970" end="00:15:26.110" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how the world could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.069" end="00:15:27.910" style="s2">mastered if it was mastered completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.110" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how an individual might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.910" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">able to manage that we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:35.410" style="s2">transformations that might make possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:37.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a few quotes that you that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:39.940" style="s2">transcribed that from the ideology logos</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.750" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">and belief lecture which I remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.940" end="00:15:42.910" style="s2">having a kind of hair stand up on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:45.670" style="s2">back of my neck moment when I heard you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.910" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2">say this I don&#39;t know what happens to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.670" end="00:15:48.490" style="s2">person if they bring themselves</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.490" end="00:15:53.110" style="s2">intimations of what that might mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:56.740" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s mysticism rather than</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.110" end="00:15:58.630" style="s2">religion is it not well I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.740" end="00:16:00.310" style="s2">you can you could draw a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.630" end="00:16:01.509" style="s2">between those two things to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.310" end="00:16:03.189" style="s2">because you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.509" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">in a religious system there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.189" end="00:16:07.420" style="s2">components and people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:08.680" style="s2">temperamentally inclined to align with</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.420" end="00:16:10.600" style="s2">one or the other there&#39;s a dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.680" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">component so the Conservatives are more</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.600" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">likely to align with that and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:17.380" style="s2">active mystical component which updates</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:20.410" style="s2">the conservative component but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.380" end="00:16:22.689" style="s2">threatens it so which is what creative</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.410" end="00:16:26.199" style="s2">thought does in general and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.689" end="00:16:27.959" style="s2">say that the mystical element of that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.199" end="00:16:31.029" style="s2">religious but it&#39;s more on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.959" end="00:16:34.449" style="s2">transformative side but you know I also</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.029" end="00:16:37.480" style="s2">think that figures like the Buddha you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.449" end="00:16:40.120" style="s2">know he&#39;s an exemplar of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.480" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">possibilities of that alignment and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.120" end="00:16:43.930" style="s2">exercise is the yogic exercises for</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:45.670" style="s2">example our attempts to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.930" end="00:16:48.040" style="s2">alignment into being you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very centered on the body which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.040" end="00:16:50.510" style="s2">quite interesting even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.490" style="s2">spiritual tradition right</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.510" end="00:16:54.590" style="s2">very very centered on the body and when</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">you say you have intimations of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.590" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">that might mean can you explain what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">mean by that well I&#39;ve had experiences</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:05.780" style="s2">where everything came together you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:09.010" style="s2">and and and there are very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.780" end="00:17:12.680" style="s2">experiences and and they&#39;re they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.010" end="00:17:15.170" style="s2">characterized by it&#39;s like everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.680" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">turns into a musical symphony where each</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.170" end="00:17:21.170" style="s2">part is exactly appropriate for that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:23.300" style="s2">moment and and I think music actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.170" end="00:17:25.070" style="s2">expresses that which is partly why music</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.300" end="00:17:27.500" style="s2">produces transcendent experiences you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.070" end="00:17:30.230" style="s2">know when people are dancing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.500" end="00:17:33.260" style="s2">something profound and they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.230" end="00:17:36.020" style="s2">into it let&#39;s say the music and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.260" end="00:17:37.430" style="s2">person are the same thing and then if if</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.020" end="00:17:39.380" style="s2">things really get going you see this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.430" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">sometimes in a rock concert or a musical</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.380" end="00:17:46.040" style="s2">concert where everyone is in the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.100" end="00:17:49.250" style="s2">place right the band kicks into high</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.040" end="00:17:51.050" style="s2">gear and they&#39;re way out beyond where</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.250" end="00:17:53.000" style="s2">they usually go you don&#39;t see that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">often in a concert even a great concert</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.000" end="00:17:57.710" style="s2">but now and then you really see it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:17:59.990" style="s2">the whole place is one thing that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.710" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2">pulsing you know and that&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.990" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">experience and I think it is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:05.480" style="s2">intimation of paradise it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:07.220" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.480" end="00:18:09.170" style="s2">and you can think about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.220" end="00:18:11.090" style="s2">psychologically you know because it also</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.170" end="00:18:13.130" style="s2">makes sense psychologically that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.090" end="00:18:16.190" style="s2">at our best when we&#39;re integrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.130" end="00:18:19.940" style="s2">completely and there is an effect of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.190" end="00:18:21.470" style="s2">that integration in principle on what we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.940" end="00:18:23.930" style="s2">would normally regard as external</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.470" end="00:18:25.670" style="s2">reality because external reality can</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.930" end="00:18:29.810" style="s2">line up with that integration as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.670" end="00:18:31.610" style="s2">and so-called external reality and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.810" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">think people probably experience that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.610" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">when they have peak sexual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.740" end="00:18:37.880" style="s2">with someone you know where there&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:39.470" style="s2">intimacy because they&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.880" end="00:18:42.350" style="s2">place at the same time and everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.470" end="00:18:45.110" style="s2">comes together for that moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.350" end="00:18:49.390" style="s2">maybe literally yes yes literally right</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.110" end="00:18:55.490" style="s2">and and and I also don&#39;t think that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.390" end="00:18:57.260" style="s2">linguistic usage is chance right because</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.490" end="00:19:02.050" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a place where that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.260" end="00:19:03.920" style="s2">experience is a brief intimation of of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.050" end="00:19:08.060" style="s2">heaven that might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.920" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">way of thinking about it so this message</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.060" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">of responsibility and meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:16.490" style="s2">resonating most deeply with men every</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">public appearance that I&#39;ve made that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.490" end="00:19:20.930" style="s2">related to the sort of topics that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:22.670" style="s2">discussing is overwhelmingly men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.930" end="00:19:24.650" style="s2">like it&#39;s like eighty-five to ninety</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.670" end="00:19:26.270" style="s2">percent and so I thought wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.650" end="00:19:28.220" style="s2">weird like what the hell&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.270" end="00:19:30.920" style="s2">exactly and then the other thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.220" end="00:19:32.540" style="s2">noticed is that I&#39;ve been talking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.920" end="00:19:33.680" style="s2">to the crowds that I&#39;ve been talking to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.540" end="00:19:35.870" style="s2">not about rights but about</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.680" end="00:19:37.430" style="s2">responsibility right because he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.870" end="00:19:38.660" style="s2">have the bloody converse what are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.430" end="00:19:41.210" style="s2">doing you can&#39;t have the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.660" end="00:19:43.430" style="s2">about rights without the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.210" end="00:19:46.250" style="s2">about responsibility because your rights</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:49.160" style="s2">are my responsibility that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.250" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">are technically so you just can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.160" end="00:19:53.180" style="s2">only half of that discussion and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:54.590" style="s2">only having half that discussion and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.180" end="00:19:57.290" style="s2">question is well what the hell are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.590" end="00:19:59.510" style="s2">leaving out if you only have that half</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.290" end="00:20:01.010" style="s2">of the discussion and the answer is well</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.510" end="00:20:02.930" style="s2">you&#39;re leaving out responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.010" end="00:20:03.920" style="s2">then the question is well what are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.930" end="00:20:05.930" style="s2">leaving out if you&#39;re leaving out</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.920" end="00:20:07.550" style="s2">responsibility and the answer might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.930" end="00:20:09.890" style="s2">well maybe you&#39;re leaving out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.550" end="00:20:12.220" style="s2">meaning of life that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.890" end="00:20:14.950" style="s2">like to me it&#39;s like here you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.220" end="00:20:18.260" style="s2">suffering away what makes it worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.950" end="00:20:21.470" style="s2">right you know you&#39;re completely oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.260" end="00:20:24.770" style="s2">you&#39;re completely you have no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.470" end="00:20:28.570" style="s2">you&#39;re you it&#39;s almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.770" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">describe how bad an idea that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:32.570" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s what gives life</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:35.870" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.570" end="00:20:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like lift a load then you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.870" end="00:20:40.910" style="s2">tolerate yourself right because look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.460" end="00:20:42.430" style="s2">your useless easily hurt easily killed</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.910" end="00:20:45.680" style="s2">why should you have any self-respect</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.430" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the story of the fall pick</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.680" end="00:20:49.490" style="s2">something up and carry it pick make it</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">heavy enough so that you can think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.490" end="00:20:52.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:54.650" style="s2">useless as I am at least I could move</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.280" end="00:20:56.060" style="s2">that from there to there well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.650" end="00:20:58.490" style="s2">really cool about that is that when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.060" end="00:21:00.950" style="s2">talk to these crowds about this the</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:05.270" style="s2">been talking about this mythological</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.470" end="00:21:07.040" style="s2">material for a long time and I can see</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.270" end="00:21:09.380" style="s2">when I&#39;m watching crowds people you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.040" end="00:21:11.390" style="s2">their eyebrows lift their eyes let light</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.380" end="00:21:13.490" style="s2">out because I put something together for</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.390" end="00:21:15.230" style="s2">them that&#39;s what mythological stories do</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.490" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">so I&#39;m not taking responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.230" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s what the stories do</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:20.280" style="s2">so I save the story people go click</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">click click you know in their eyes light</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.280" end="00:21:22.500" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:24.270" style="s2">but this responsibility thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.500" end="00:21:26.220" style="s2">whole new order of this is that young</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.270" end="00:21:28.920" style="s2">men are so hungry for that it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.220" end="00:21:32.010" style="s2">unbelievable it just blows me away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.920" end="00:21:35.670" style="s2">like really that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.010" end="00:21:37.560" style="s2">counterculture grow the hell up and do</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.670" end="00:21:39.810" style="s2">something useful really I could do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.560" end="00:21:41.400" style="s2">oh I&#39;m so excited by that idea no one</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.810" end="00:21:43.410" style="s2">ever mentioned that before</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.400" end="00:21:47.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like rights rights rights rights</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.410" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">Jesus it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s appalling it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.310" end="00:21:51.510" style="s2">it&#39;s and and I feel that that&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:54.060" style="s2">felt by the people who are who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.510" end="00:21:55.560" style="s2">coming out to to listen to these sorts</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.060" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">of things to there they&#39;ve had enough of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.560" end="00:22:00.920" style="s2">that so and they better have because</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.470" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a non-productive mode of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.920" end="00:22:06.180" style="s2">responsibility man I think it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:08.820" style="s2">in a deep level the West has lost faith</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.180" end="00:22:11.340" style="s2">in the idea of masculinity now that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.820" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">different than the death of God it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.340" end="00:22:18.090" style="s2">same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:19.770" style="s2">the consequence of that would be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.090" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">that&#39;s most of what he wrote about you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.770" end="00:22:23.940" style="s2">know and so you&#39;d say well the divine</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:25.950" style="s2">symbol of masculinity has been</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.940" end="00:22:29.610" style="s2">obliterated well so then what do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.950" end="00:22:31.560" style="s2">expect what it what&#39;s gonna happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.610" end="00:22:35.490" style="s2">gonna that means masculinity is going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.560" end="00:22:37.950" style="s2">become weak and especially if the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.490" end="00:22:41.370" style="s2">is also denigrated right which it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.950" end="00:22:45.410" style="s2">definitely is so what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.370" end="00:22:50.700" style="s2">the ideal that man could aspire to is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.410" end="00:22:51.930" style="s2">denigrated and well then with your ideal</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.700" end="00:22:55.430" style="s2">in tatters</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.930" end="00:23:00.090" style="s2">you&#39;re weak that&#39;s that&#39;s definitional</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.430" end="00:23:03.570" style="s2">so I think the reason that men have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.090" end="00:23:07.410" style="s2">responding positively to my my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.570" end="00:23:13.190" style="s2">let&#39;s say is that I don&#39;t buy any of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.410" end="00:23:17.210" style="s2">that I like the masculine spirit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.190" end="00:23:20.070" style="s2">necessary and it&#39;s not fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:23.640" style="s2">carnage and pillaging it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.070" end="00:23:26.760" style="s2">fundamentally rape culture you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.640" end="00:23:28.440" style="s2">not fundamentally world destroying and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.760" end="00:23:31.049" style="s2">all of those things have been all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.440" end="00:23:33.000" style="s2">those aspersions have been cast upon</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.049" end="00:23:36.030" style="s2">that&#39;s partly the guilt of Western</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.000" end="00:23:40.110" style="s2">society for technological progress even</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.030" end="00:23:45.150" style="s2">and those are reasonable challenges to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.110" end="00:23:47.909" style="s2">be set before men but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.150" end="00:23:51.390" style="s2">reasonable accusations to swallow</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.909" end="00:23:54.059" style="s2">without criticism and and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.390" end="00:23:57.030" style="s2">what is it what what is the masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.059" end="00:23:59.309" style="s2">we can aspire to well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.030" end="00:24:03.690" style="s2">responsibility fundamentally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.309" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s to put it symbolically is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.690" end="00:24:08.850" style="s2">your your responsibility is to incarnate</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:11.490" style="s2">the Spirit of the logos that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.850" end="00:24:16.530" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s your role in life</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.490" end="00:24:18.809" style="s2">and that is independent to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.530" end="00:24:21.960" style="s2">in whether or not you accept the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.809" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">a transcendent and eternal reality now</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.960" end="00:24:29.220" style="s2">I&#39;m not making a case for that or</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">against that I those things are beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.220" end="00:24:37.500" style="s2">human understanding but we know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:40.140" style="s2">happens if people act poorly if men act</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.140" end="00:24:44.039" style="s2">the world turns into something that&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:55.980" style="s2">the 20th century so we should learn that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.090" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">lesson and what that lesson is is pick</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.980" end="00:25:00.419" style="s2">up the world on your shoulders and walk</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">forward pick up the world with all of</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:38.779" style="s2">sex sex is very very very old it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.779" end="00:28:41.240" style="s2">fundamental issue and sex is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.779" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">fundamentally about female and male and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.240" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">there&#39;s no getting around that now as I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:47.750" style="s2">said you can distinguish masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:51.350" style="s2">feminine from that and you can speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.750" end="00:28:53.720" style="s2">about the psychological components of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.350" end="00:28:56.269" style="s2">sex as well as the physiological</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.720" end="00:29:00.220" style="s2">components but the real radicals deny</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.269" end="00:29:00.220" style="s2">the physiological components it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.590" end="00:29:07.460" style="s2">that&#39;s okay except when they force other</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.630" end="00:29:09.320" style="s2">people to do the same kind of denial</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.460" end="00:29:12.169" style="s2">like people are entitled to their</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.169" end="00:29:17.929" style="s2">it in the law and so that&#39;s why I was</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.929" end="00:29:22.820" style="s2">to transgender people or I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.179" end="00:29:24.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a sideshow in in many ways I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.820" end="00:29:26.510" style="s2">not trying to trivialize it but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.710" end="00:29:29.000" style="s2">like a it&#39;s not the main event it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.510" end="00:29:33.590" style="s2">emblematic of something else otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.000" end="00:29:36.639" style="s2">no one would have cared and I just see</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.590" end="00:29:40.130" style="s2">it as fundamentally oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.639" end="00:29:42.289" style="s2">destabilization and destruction he says</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.130" end="00:29:45.130" style="s2">to defend ourselves against resentment</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.289" end="00:29:47.770" style="s2">we each need to identify it in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.130" end="00:29:50.679" style="s2">our shadows</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.770" end="00:29:52.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly why young believed</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.679" end="00:29:55.270" style="s2">that it was necessary for people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.660" end="00:29:56.790" style="s2">integrate their shadow and he said that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.270" end="00:30:00.220" style="s2">was a terrible thing for people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.790" end="00:30:02.170" style="s2">attempt because the human shadow mmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.220" end="00:30:04.900" style="s2">which is all those things about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.170" end="00:30:07.090" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want to realize reaches</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.900" end="00:30:09.790" style="s2">all the way to hell and what he meant by</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.090" end="00:30:11.350" style="s2">that was it&#39;s through an analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.790" end="00:30:13.690" style="s2">your own shadow that you can come to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.350" end="00:30:16.360" style="s2">understand why other people are capable</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.690" end="00:30:18.700" style="s2">and you as well of the sorts of terrible</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.360" end="00:30:21.070" style="s2">atrocities that characterize let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.700" end="00:30:23.020" style="s2">the 20th century and without that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.070" end="00:30:25.450" style="s2">understanding there&#39;s no possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.020" end="00:30:27.730" style="s2">bringing it under control when you study</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.450" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">Nazi Germany for example or you study</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.730" end="00:30:33.460" style="s2">the Soviet Union particularly under</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:36.070" style="s2">Stalin and you&#39;re asking yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.460" end="00:30:37.929" style="s2">what are these perpetrators like forget</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.070" end="00:30:39.640" style="s2">about the victims let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.929" end="00:30:42.370" style="s2">perpetrators the answer is they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.640" end="00:30:43.809" style="s2">like you and if you don&#39;t know that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.370" end="00:30:46.600" style="s2">just means that you don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.809" end="00:30:48.550" style="s2">about people including yourself and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.600" end="00:30:51.670" style="s2">it also means that you have to discover</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.550" end="00:30:54.280" style="s2">why they&#39;re just like you and believe me</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.670" end="00:30:56.140" style="s2">that&#39;s no picnic so that&#39;s enough to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.280" end="00:30:58.450" style="s2">traumatize people and that&#39;s partly why</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.140" end="00:31:00.429" style="s2">they don&#39;t do it and it&#39;s also partly</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.450" end="00:31:04.330" style="s2">why the path to enlightenment and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.429" end="00:31:06.400" style="s2">is seldom trod upon because if it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.330" end="00:31:08.740" style="s2">all a matter of following your bliss and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.400" end="00:31:10.120" style="s2">doing what made you happy then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.740" end="00:31:12.790" style="s2">in the world would be a paragon of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.120" end="00:31:14.890" style="s2">wisdom but it&#39;s not that at all it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.790" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of facing the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.890" end="00:31:18.580" style="s2">least want to face while through</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">listening to it started to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.580" end="00:31:21.520" style="s2">a lot of what I&#39;ve been doing over the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.340" style="s2">last few years I&#39;ve done quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.520" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">sort of deep transformational practices</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.340" end="00:31:28.750" style="s2">a lot of shadow works of integrating the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:30.280" style="s2">shadow and actually feeling that real</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.750" end="00:31:32.679" style="s2">sense of becoming more in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.280" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">myself feeling that these different</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.679" end="00:31:35.559" style="s2">parts of myself coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:38.620" style="s2">feeling more embodied and more present</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.559" end="00:31:39.910" style="s2">in the world but it was through</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.620" end="00:31:41.980" style="s2">listening to you that I made this</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.910" end="00:31:43.450" style="s2">connection with the logos with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.980" end="00:31:45.340" style="s2">that this is actually a deep principle</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.450" end="00:31:47.410" style="s2">of Western culture which gave it another</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.340" end="00:31:50.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the principle of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.410" end="00:31:54.130" style="s2">Incarnation right because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.110" end="00:31:56.050" style="s2">Incarnation is is as at least a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.130" end="00:31:57.929" style="s2">representation of the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.050" end="00:32:00.970" style="s2">Spirit has to fully inhabit the body</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.929" end="00:32:01.159" style="s2">right and that&#39;s also a remarkable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.970" end="00:32:02.840" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.159" end="00:32:05.479" style="s2">remarkable idea especially because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.840" end="00:32:08.149" style="s2">spirit so to speak the psyche if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.479" end="00:32:10.549" style="s2">want flees from the body in terror</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.149" end="00:32:13.159" style="s2">because the body is the place of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.549" end="00:32:15.470" style="s2">mortality and suffering and so people</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.159" end="00:32:16.820" style="s2">are disembodied and it&#39;s because what</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.470" end="00:32:19.159" style="s2">one way of looking at is because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.820" end="00:32:22.039" style="s2">too afraid to become fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.159" end="00:32:23.749" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re afraid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.039" end="00:32:26.210" style="s2">reason to be afraid</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.749" end="00:32:27.799" style="s2">but the question is well what would you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.210" end="00:32:29.539" style="s2">be like if you had the courage to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.799" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">fully embodied and that&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.539" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">incarnate that&#39;s another way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:36.169" style="s2">about that and the idea that Christian</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:39.049" style="s2">ideas that the fully incarnate human</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.169" end="00:32:42.289" style="s2">being is the Messiah that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.049" end="00:32:45.739" style="s2">that&#39;s a hell of an idea you know but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.289" end="00:32:50.119" style="s2">means embracing the horrors of the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.739" end="00:32:51.739" style="s2">that&#39;s what it means and that&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.119" end="00:32:53.090" style="s2">the horrors of the world but the evil of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.739" end="00:32:57.379" style="s2">the world you know so there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.090" end="00:33:00.200" style="s2">that Christ absolutely well then those</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.379" end="00:33:02.330" style="s2">are those are not different and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.200" end="00:33:04.429" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea that not only was</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.330" end="00:33:06.470" style="s2">Christ the Incarnate spirit right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.429" end="00:33:08.690" style="s2">fully descended into the body let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.470" end="00:33:10.669" style="s2">but that he also took the sins of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.690" end="00:33:13.779" style="s2">world onto himself and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.669" end="00:33:16.309" style="s2">is that psychologically speaking is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.779" end="00:33:19.190" style="s2">part of spiritual development is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.309" end="00:33:24.200" style="s2">recognize the satanic tendencies that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.190" end="00:33:26.539" style="s2">characterize you and to fully wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.200" end="00:33:28.220" style="s2">with them and to and to integrate them</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.539" end="00:33:30.979" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.220" end="00:33:33.349" style="s2">to cast them away it&#39;s to transmute them</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.979" end="00:33:34.820" style="s2">you know and you can see the difference</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.349" end="00:33:36.200" style="s2">between people who&#39;ve done that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.820" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t at least to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.200" end="00:33:40.999" style="s2">degree because people who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:43.609" style="s2">integrated the shadow at all are naive</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.999" end="00:33:45.379" style="s2">and you can tell that when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.609" end="00:33:46.879" style="s2">them and you can tell that when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.379" end="00:33:48.679" style="s2">to them and because they&#39;re naive</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.879" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">they&#39;re often resentful as well because</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.679" end="00:33:52.609" style="s2">they get taken advantage of and someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:56.119" style="s2">who&#39;s integrated that more they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.609" end="00:33:58.009" style="s2">dangerous in in the martial arts sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.119" end="00:33:59.960" style="s2">way which is they&#39;re dangerous but they</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.009" end="00:34:06.099" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be they don&#39;t have to use</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.960" end="00:34:06.099" style="s2">it because their presence radiates</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.850" end="00:34:14.280" style="s2">what would you say it doesn&#39;t radiate</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.980" end="00:34:17.160" style="s2">threat exactly well certainly strength</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.280" end="00:34:19.740" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.160" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">for havoc that&#39;s the right way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.740" end="00:34:25.110" style="s2">thinking about it there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.110" end="00:34:30.030" style="s2">really necessary it&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.260" end="00:34:31.170" style="s2">that gives people self respect this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.030" end="00:34:33.020" style="s2">an interesting thing about the</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.680" end="00:34:45.810" style="s2">gives you far more respect for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">strangely enough because the same</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:51.960" style="s2">animal or even a monster it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.400" end="00:34:54.330" style="s2">though so then maybe you learn to treat</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.960" end="00:34:56.220" style="s2">yourself differently like I think this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.330" end="00:34:58.410" style="s2">is particularly true with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.220" end="00:35:01.890" style="s2">discipline of children you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.410" end="00:35:03.690" style="s2">know that you&#39;re a monster and that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.890" end="00:35:05.940" style="s2">will manifest itself in your life</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.690" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">consciously or unconsciously and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.940" end="00:35:11.100" style="s2">unconsciously it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">then you become better at disciplining</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.100" end="00:35:15.240" style="s2">children and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:18.780" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to expose them to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.240" end="00:35:20.850" style="s2">dark side and so if they behave and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.780" end="00:35:23.490" style="s2">don&#39;t provoke you which means they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.850" end="00:35:26.040" style="s2">also behave for other people then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.490" end="00:35:29.010" style="s2">don&#39;t the monstrous part can stay in</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.040" end="00:35:31.950" style="s2">abeyance and then that&#39;s great but if</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.010" end="00:35:33.390" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand yourself as capable</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.950" end="00:35:35.370" style="s2">of wreaking havoc and that can be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.390" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">kind of havoc that unfolds over decades</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.370" end="00:35:38.130" style="s2">right because if you&#39;re going to abuse a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.130" end="00:35:43.470" style="s2">it&#39;s the primitive form of abuse is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:45.630" style="s2">physical abuse the sophisticated form of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.470" end="00:35:48.180" style="s2">abuse is the continual undermining of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.630" end="00:35:50.730" style="s2">the child&#39;s courage across perhaps their</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.180" end="00:35:53.370" style="s2">entire life and that there&#39;s a terribly</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.730" end="00:35:57.660" style="s2">monstrous element to that and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.370" end="00:36:01.170" style="s2">not respected properly by the child say</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.660" end="00:36:03.660" style="s2">you will absolutely take revenge on them</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.170" end="00:36:05.010" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s the holes in some</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.660" end="00:36:07.320" style="s2">sense that&#39;s the whole Freudian</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.010" end="00:36:10.020" style="s2">psychoanalytic story it&#39;s not all of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.320" end="00:36:12.870" style="s2">but it&#39;s a huge part of it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.020" end="00:36:14.970" style="s2">that you you say that you have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.870" end="00:36:17.100" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re dangerous or become</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.970" end="00:36:18.450" style="s2">dangerous because I&#39;d also say that if</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.100" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">you haven&#39;t done that kind of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.450" end="00:36:21.840" style="s2">work if you haven&#39;t made friends with</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.280" end="00:36:22.330" style="s2">your anger if you haven&#39;t integrated it</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.330" end="00:36:26.290" style="s2">actually more dangerous yes then things</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.820" end="00:36:27.850" style="s2">will happen that will it will come out</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.290" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">in a way that you don&#39;t expect right it</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.850" end="00:36:32.530" style="s2">comes out disintegrate it so it comes</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.720" style="s2">out as an autonomous spirit right under</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.530" end="00:36:36.670" style="s2">no-one&#39;s control and that&#39;s like a burst</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.720" end="00:36:38.980" style="s2">of rage let&#39;s say you either have that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.670" end="00:36:43.390" style="s2">or it has you those are the options and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.980" end="00:36:46.540" style="s2">you don&#39;t become safe by being castrated</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.390" end="00:36:50.380" style="s2">right that&#39;s not the right move forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.540" end="00:36:53.170" style="s2">you can actually see a change in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.380" end="00:36:55.300" style="s2">people&#39;s faces when that part of them is</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:57.580" style="s2">integrated when the I would say the rage</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.300" end="00:36:59.860" style="s2">circuit is integrated because their face</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.580" end="00:37:02.110" style="s2">is hardened like they no longer look</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.860" end="00:37:04.060" style="s2">like wide-eyed children that they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.110" end="00:37:07.090" style="s2">longer someone to whom things only</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.060" end="00:37:09.130" style="s2">happen there there&#39;s someone who makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.090" end="00:37:11.110" style="s2">things happen and there isn&#39;t much</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.130" end="00:37:12.970" style="s2">difference between being dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.110" end="00:37:16.450" style="s2">being indomitable right there.this</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.970" end="00:37:17.770" style="s2">they&#39;re that they&#39;re they&#39;re the same</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.770" end="00:37:23.620" style="s2">perspectives and so you know in my new</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.310" end="00:37:25.290" style="s2">book I wrote a little bit about there</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.620" end="00:37:27.820" style="s2">was an idea in the 80s that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.290" end="00:37:30.310" style="s2">reasonably popular among psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.820" end="00:37:32.500" style="s2">that the way to regulate male aggression</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.310" end="00:37:36.690" style="s2">was to socialize little boys like little</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.500" end="00:37:42.250" style="s2">girls and that&#39;s a very very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.690" end="00:37:45.400" style="s2">so because suppressing that aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.250" end="00:37:47.080" style="s2">competitive urge which also</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.400" end="00:37:49.840" style="s2">characterized as many women by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.080" end="00:37:52.690" style="s2">although it&#39;s more common among men it</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.840" end="00:37:54.370" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what you do you you you</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.690" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">integrate it this is why I&#39;m such a fan</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.370" end="00:37:58.870" style="s2">of Piaget you know as opposed not as</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.000" style="s2">opposed to Freud but I think Piaget is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.870" end="00:38:03.340" style="s2">developmental model is superior to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.000" end="00:38:06.220" style="s2">Freud&#39;s developmental model because for</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.340" end="00:38:09.100" style="s2">Piaget the process of becoming civilized</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.220" end="00:38:12.670" style="s2">is a process of continual integration</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.100" end="00:38:14.680" style="s2">including the integration of what Freud</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.670" end="00:38:16.090" style="s2">would consider the in you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.680" end="00:38:17.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not as if for I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.090" end="00:38:19.930" style="s2">because he wanted people to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.980" end="00:38:21.970" style="s2">the it but he you know he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.930" end="00:38:25.750" style="s2">conceptualized socialization as the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.970" end="00:38:27.370" style="s2">super-ego inhibiting the it&#39;d you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.750" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">or or suppressing it</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.370" end="00:38:32.020" style="s2">that&#39;s only that only happens when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:34.600" style="s2">socialization process is bad when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.020" end="00:38:36.190" style="s2">good like if you have a competitive</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.190" end="00:38:43.300" style="s2">was and is a competitive person you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.329" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">them integrate that into the ethos of</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.300" end="00:38:48.450" style="s2">fair play and then it&#39;s it&#39;s a mark of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.500" style="s2">character strength at that point and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.450" end="00:38:52.740" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s there&#39;s no doubt</p>
