<p begin="00:05:39.260" end="00:05:42.590" style="s2">of read them and share them online or</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.970" end="00:05:46.310" style="s2">you can download them and kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.590" end="00:05:48.020" style="s2">still prefer that kind of slower digest</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.310" end="00:05:51.350" style="s2">of you know having the whole you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.020" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">the especially with this issue the whole</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:05.090" style="s2">emergent structure and so for me just</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.900" end="00:06:07.130" style="s2">having that ability to kind of take them</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.090" end="00:06:09.169" style="s2">all in at once is really important so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.130" end="00:06:12.410" style="s2">offer them in the in the journal format</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.169" end="00:06:15.140" style="s2">and then we also do podcasts I&#39;ve done</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.099" end="00:06:58.299" style="s2">and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.719" end="00:07:01.389" style="s2">in science and all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.299" end="00:07:03.909" style="s2">things things that you can only capture</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.389" end="00:07:06.939" style="s2">you can only capture a certain dimension</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.909" end="00:07:09.519" style="s2">of them in sort of traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.939" end="00:07:12.129" style="s2">academic discursive settings so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.519" end="00:07:14.589" style="s2">trying to like hit it in in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.129" end="00:07:18.399" style="s2">different ways so the the side view is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.589" end="00:07:20.709" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know what else I should say</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.399" end="00:07:22.329" style="s2">about it I guess the name is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.709" end="00:07:23.849" style="s2">attitude right we&#39;re trying to we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.329" end="00:07:26.709" style="s2">trying to look at things from the side</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.849" end="00:07:32.559" style="s2">from a side view which basically just</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.709" end="00:07:34.149" style="s2">means trying to understand not just if</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.559" end="00:07:37.119" style="s2">you look at a lot of history books for</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.149" end="00:07:38.860" style="s2">example you see that you see if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.119" end="00:07:41.860" style="s2">looking at a history of philosophy for</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.860" end="00:07:46.509" style="s2">example you see a history of completed</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.860" end="00:07:51.189" style="s2">texts completed works sort of set epochs</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.509" end="00:07:53.349" style="s2">and periods and it it&#39;s all there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.189" end="00:07:55.479" style="s2">just everything there in the finished</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.349" end="00:07:58.360" style="s2">product but the the side view</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.479" end="00:08:02.499" style="s2">perspective is to actually try and take</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.360" end="00:08:05.649" style="s2">on all of the practices and experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.499" end="00:08:08.289" style="s2">and and into intuitions and methods that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.649" end="00:08:10.329" style="s2">actually led those people to create the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.289" end="00:08:12.819" style="s2">things that that we kind of see as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.329" end="00:08:14.619" style="s2">finished product so that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.819" end="00:08:18.519" style="s2">the side view is it&#39;s an it&#39;s a focus on</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.619" end="00:08:20.559" style="s2">the on the practice that leads to the</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.509" end="00:08:28.809" style="s2">right right and you and I were talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.999" end="00:08:30.219" style="s2">last week about this is my opinion but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.809" end="00:08:34.029" style="s2">think other people should participate as</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.219" end="00:08:36.009" style="s2">well is that how the side view is sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.029" end="00:08:39.819" style="s2">of like the gold standard of the like a</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.779" end="00:09:01.029" style="s2">you can talk about how it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:02.949" style="s2">that para academic journal thing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.029" end="00:09:04.449" style="s2">also how peer hadou plays such a central</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.670" end="00:10:11.050" style="s2">or withdrawal and kind of a monkish way</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.030" end="00:11:28.330" style="s2">is your bodily senses actually change</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">you actually transform sedation at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.330" end="00:11:33.250" style="s2">pretty deep level and I get all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.930" end="00:11:35.380" style="s2">from it though</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.250" end="00:11:37.660" style="s2">and other people he&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.380" end="00:11:40.630" style="s2">alone in it he&#39;s sort of the person who</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.660" end="00:11:43.000" style="s2">invited that notion into my life and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.630" end="00:11:46.300" style="s2">I I continue to think with him and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.000" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">continue to be inspired by him but he</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.300" end="00:11:51.730" style="s2">also in addition to having that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">you know deeper understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.730" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">philosophy is also had had quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">of opinions about how philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:06.010" style="s2">taught in these earlier Greek contexts</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:11.170" style="s2">and how they&#39;re how its taught today and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.010" end="00:12:15.160" style="s2">he definitely sees a a loss of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.170" end="00:12:16.630" style="s2">the existential or spiritual or in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.160" end="00:12:19.330" style="s2">context you could say religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.630" end="00:12:21.610" style="s2">dimension the therapeutic dimension</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.330" end="00:12:25.240" style="s2">perhaps that has always been a part of a</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.240" end="00:12:30.190" style="s2">to it and something happened to it with</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.200" end="00:12:31.450" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to go into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.190" end="00:12:33.640" style="s2">history that he gives of it but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.450" end="00:12:37.860" style="s2">something happened to it with the rise</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.640" end="00:12:41.950" style="s2">of the modern university system where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.860" end="00:12:44.350" style="s2">we we got into a focus of getting really</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.950" end="00:12:48.900" style="s2">good at learning about texts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.350" end="00:12:48.900" style="s2">learning how to criticize texts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.290" end="00:12:54.610" style="s2">building up these figures who have these</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.310" end="00:12:59.020" style="s2">kind of encyclopedic knowledge of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.610" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">history of philosophy without very much</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:07.060" style="s2">in their daily lives and so I that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:10.360" style="s2">also a part of what the side view is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.060" end="00:13:15.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s on the one hand recognizing</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.130" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">academic process there are there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.340" end="00:13:25.330" style="s2">a real lineage and a real tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:29.020" style="s2">goes back thousands of years of teachers</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.330" end="00:13:32.170" style="s2">and students of of mastery of really</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.020" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">understanding what philosophy is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.170" end="00:13:35.470" style="s2">you know a lifetime of study</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.540" end="00:13:35.740" style="s2">acknowledging that that&#39;s important but</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.710" end="00:13:53.620" style="s2">side view you know circulates freely on</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:55.750" style="s2">the internet it&#39;s it has elements of an</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.220" end="00:15:37.000" style="s2">realizing like oh they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.390" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">the chatbox and I think we were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.730" end="00:16:24.519" style="s2">about allowing each sort of author to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:26.260" style="s2">have a chance to speak I&#39;m gonna veto</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.519" end="00:16:28.060" style="s2">that because intellectuals usually talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.260" end="00:16:29.560" style="s2">a lot and we have a certain time period</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.060" end="00:16:32.019" style="s2">right here and I want to kind of place</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.030" end="00:17:10.179" style="s2">question about this latest release so</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.290" end="00:17:12.370" style="s2">you have the three sections you have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.179" end="00:17:15.970" style="s2">wayfinding cultures ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.370" end="00:17:19.270" style="s2">and meta modernism I&#39;m curious did you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.970" end="00:17:22.900" style="s2">these just naturally emerge or were you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.270" end="00:17:27.669" style="s2">kind of looking for these themes no</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.900" end="00:17:29.290" style="s2">there there there and I mean in some</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.669" end="00:17:30.790" style="s2">sense they&#39;re really obviously there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.290" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">in some sense they&#39;re a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.790" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">subtly but the I mean we can go through</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:39.850" style="s2">the three of them the wayfinding</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">cultures is well Bonita and her essay</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.850" end="00:17:46.330" style="s2">talks about wayfinding wayfinding is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:49.390" style="s2">kind of sense making but it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.330" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">she talks about it maybe Bonita wants to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.390" end="00:17:55.870" style="s2">speak to it but she&#39;s talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">in I want to back up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.870" end="00:18:00.340" style="s2">actually because the way we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:02.740" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.340" end="00:18:05.590" style="s2">on the side view is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.740" end="00:18:08.890" style="s2">different from the way sense-making is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.590" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">used in the kind of a larger</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.890" end="00:18:11.860" style="s2">conversation they overlap and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:14.500" style="s2">related but they&#39;re also a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.860" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">different and if you read like Benitez</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.500" end="00:18:19.179" style="s2">si you get this kind of this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:22.360" style="s2">sense making that&#39;s coming out of the in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.179" end="00:18:24.450" style="s2">activist tradition that draws on people</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.360" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">like merleau-ponty and Francisco Varela</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.450" end="00:18:29.740" style="s2">evan Thompson all kinds of figures and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.920" style="s2">that&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.740" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">sense-making is really kind of opening</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.920" end="00:18:38.710" style="s2">up how our perception works our lived</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.190" end="00:18:41.800" style="s2">experience our day-to-day sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.710" end="00:18:44.020" style="s2">reality in our sense of salience and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.800" end="00:18:47.260" style="s2">meaning and how we navigate and all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.020" end="00:18:51.160" style="s2">those things and Bonita picked up this</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.260" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">example of wayfinding where we faring</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.160" end="00:18:56.290" style="s2">seafaring all of these different ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.900" style="s2">that people learn how to get around</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.290" end="00:19:02.290" style="s2">territories where they don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.900" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">a good representational model like we</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.290" end="00:19:07.210" style="s2">usually think about it so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">piece coming from Bonita Nick in his</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.210" end="00:19:13.720" style="s2">piece is talking about a civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:15.700" style="s2">scale perception how do we think on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.720" end="00:19:17.890" style="s2">scale of ten thousand years in in either</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.700" end="00:19:20.350" style="s2">direction right that&#39;s that&#39;s the long</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.890" end="00:19:23.410" style="s2">now foundation thing and how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.350" end="00:19:27.130" style="s2">do you embody that and so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.410" end="00:19:29.020" style="s2">doing this this exercise in you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.130" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">issues called collective navigation so</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.020" end="00:19:34.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s this kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:36.910" style="s2">sense making at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.660" end="00:19:39.730" style="s2">civilizations right can we do that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.910" end="00:19:41.830" style="s2">that something we can do that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.730" end="00:19:45.000" style="s2">question for me and how does it have</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.830" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">what does it have to do with these other</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.000" end="00:19:49.990" style="s2">sort of more embodied more individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">more internal modes of perception is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.990" end="00:19:54.100" style="s2">just or just connecting up or what are</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:55.660" style="s2">the emergent properties what are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.100" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2">feedback loops what&#39;s feeding back down</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.660" end="00:20:00.730" style="s2">and what&#39;s feeding up you know all those</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:02.410" style="s2">kinds of things and Wolf Wolf tae Vee</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.730" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">sorry from pronouncing your name wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.410" end="00:20:10.300" style="s2">wolf all had this kind of bigger scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:12.400" style="s2">you know image of how would you actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.300" end="00:20:14.020" style="s2">run a society if you were in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.400" end="00:20:17.470" style="s2">it you know how would you do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.020" end="00:20:19.240" style="s2">and same thing with with Nora Bateson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.470" end="00:20:20.920" style="s2">essay oh she had this she was this kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.240" end="00:20:23.170" style="s2">of group it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.920" end="00:20:25.000" style="s2">participatory sense making it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.000" end="00:20:30.220" style="s2">and so like that&#39;s kind of the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:32.980" style="s2">group and they they all just fit</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.220" end="00:20:34.809" style="s2">together really nicely and so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.980" end="00:20:38.679" style="s2">this idea of like collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.809" end="00:20:40.210" style="s2">making can we like what are the what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.679" end="00:20:43.330" style="s2">some of the words that we can put to</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:43.780" style="s2">in a really neat way and I I had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:47.470" style="s2">little bit of an epiphany looking at</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.780" end="00:26:49.150" style="s2">those because I realized that I I had</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.470" end="00:26:51.450" style="s2">done so much of what I had done with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.150" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">side view independently of knowing about</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.450" end="00:26:57.160" style="s2">any of this other stuff you know and so</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.929" end="00:27:07.900" style="s2">emergent structure that what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.280" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">was like in the middle of like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.900" end="00:27:13.450" style="s2">little piece right there but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:15.790" style="s2">oh we all responded to some some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.450" end="00:27:19.140" style="s2">ambient signal and this structure sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.790" end="00:27:21.420" style="s2">of crystallized and so with this</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.140" end="00:27:24.060" style="s2">this issue I wanted to like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.420" end="00:27:26.430" style="s2">capture that feeling just by invoking</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.060" end="00:27:29.130" style="s2">some of the words that were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.430" end="00:27:30.420" style="s2">involved in that in those diagrams like</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.130" end="00:27:31.860" style="s2">what who are all these people what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.420" end="00:27:34.200" style="s2">they doing what what what are the key</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.860" end="00:27:35.880" style="s2">words they use okay let&#39;s it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.200" end="00:27:37.650" style="s2">that&#39;s us there&#39;s some kind of a spell</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.880" end="00:27:39.150" style="s2">here this is like we can string this</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.650" end="00:27:41.730" style="s2">into some kind of incantation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.150" end="00:27:45.890" style="s2">something will emerge and what emerged</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.730" end="00:27:53.510" style="s2">is this issue for me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.890" end="00:27:53.510" style="s2">transmission by wayfinding yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:28:05.930" style="s2">cool thanks Bonita rain Jess your</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.630" end="00:28:10.170" style="s2">question Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.930" end="00:28:14.130" style="s2">so I think creating a new publication or</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.170" end="00:28:15.330" style="s2">a new form of media is really rich for</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.130" end="00:28:18.750" style="s2">this question of what&#39;s different about</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.330" end="00:28:21.030" style="s2">it and we have our the old broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.750" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">centralized broadcast model and we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.030" end="00:28:26.280" style="s2">the contemporary web web which is sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.910" style="s2">of like a weird amalgamation of total</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.280" end="00:28:31.260" style="s2">anarchy and decentralization along with</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.910" end="00:28:34.590" style="s2">Twitter blasts that end up just being</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.260" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">broadcasts anyway so I&#39;m curious how you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.590" end="00:28:40.050" style="s2">see the relationship between the speaker</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:41.940" style="s2">and the audience changing if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.050" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">the side of you having a new</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.940" end="00:28:51.720" style="s2">relationship between speaker and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.590" end="00:28:53.400" style="s2">audience I think I think a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.720" end="00:28:55.920" style="s2">these questions in terms of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.400" end="00:29:01.860" style="s2">having sedimented layers are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.920" end="00:29:05.460" style="s2">like strata I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:08.820" style="s2">this is an either/or situation I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.460" end="00:29:11.310" style="s2">in learning environments where it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.820" end="00:29:15.630" style="s2">kind of completely horizontal sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.310" end="00:29:21.270" style="s2">circular it&#39;s good for some things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.630" end="00:29:24.150" style="s2">really poor for other things so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.270" end="00:29:25.800" style="s2">it&#39;s important to maintain what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.150" end="00:29:29.580" style="s2">healthy and beneficial about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.800" end="00:29:30.539" style="s2">structure and also look at at other</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.580" end="00:29:34.769" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.539" end="00:29:36.389" style="s2">and I think the same goes for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.769" end="00:29:38.639" style="s2">different types of ways that you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.389" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">able to put out writing is but I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.639" end="00:29:41.729" style="s2">mostly about writing and you know think</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:45.629" style="s2">about writing and editing and things</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.729" end="00:29:51.389" style="s2">like that but you&#39;re never gonna replace</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.629" end="00:29:53.879" style="s2">a book with a blogpost you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.389" end="00:29:56.820" style="s2">never gonna replace a blogpost with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.879" end="00:29:59.249" style="s2">tweet but they can complement each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.820" end="00:30:01.799" style="s2">and having like that kind of competency</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.249" end="00:30:06.419" style="s2">about what&#39;s the right medium for this</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.799" end="00:30:08.339" style="s2">idea is more interesting to me than okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.419" end="00:30:10.109" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing broadcasts we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.339" end="00:30:12.929" style="s2">doing broadcast style anymore we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.109" end="00:30:15.479" style="s2">doing 300 page books anymore we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.929" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">gonna do online shareable medium</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.479" end="00:30:19.109" style="s2">articles like that doesn&#39;t make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:21.839" style="s2">me so just finding and finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.109" end="00:30:25.949" style="s2">mix of things is kind of how I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.839" end="00:30:28.649" style="s2">about it and it&#39;s just it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.949" end="00:30:30.749" style="s2">just seeing how this like switch from</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.649" end="00:30:34.319" style="s2">sort of podcast world to whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.749" end="00:30:36.719" style="s2">zoom situation is kind of exemplifies</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.319" end="00:30:40.609" style="s2">something of a transition like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.719" end="00:30:44.459" style="s2">where I think if this had happened Peter</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.609" end="00:30:46.440" style="s2">before the pandemic you and I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.459" end="00:30:49.619" style="s2">probably be having a podcast just you</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.440" end="00:30:52.529" style="s2">and I about this but for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.619" end="00:30:55.199" style="s2">this is one of the second-order effects</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.529" end="00:30:56.729" style="s2">of being stuck at home is that now we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.199" end="00:30:59.099" style="s2">do it like this and I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.729" end="00:31:01.139" style="s2">positive so I think we should do more</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.099" end="00:31:05.940" style="s2">things like this because kind of break</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.139" end="00:31:08.249" style="s2">some walls right so Raven has a question</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.940" end="00:31:09.929" style="s2">for me so I let her ask that and then I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.249" end="00:31:10.649" style="s2">have a question for my number one</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.929" end="00:31:16.319" style="s2">frenemy</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.649" end="00:31:18.179" style="s2">Jason Schneider so uh raven hi yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.319" end="00:31:20.579" style="s2">really connects well to what you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.179" end="00:31:23.969" style="s2">said Adam actually in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.579" end="00:31:26.909" style="s2">speaking about how the stoah has emerged</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.969" end="00:31:30.659" style="s2">as a like since making form that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.909" end="00:31:33.479" style="s2">around dialogue and communitas and also</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.659" end="00:31:34.859" style="s2">about practice with the kind of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.479" end="00:31:37.229" style="s2">technologies we&#39;ve been experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.859" end="00:31:40.229" style="s2">with in the wisdom gym so my question</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.229" end="00:31:42.830" style="s2">was about is there a kind of a natural</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.229" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">complement between the side view</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.830" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">it&#39;s exploration of text and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:49.700" style="s2">multi-modality ways that we can get at</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:53.000" style="s2">the communication of things through</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.700" end="00:31:56.600" style="s2">artifacts and also how the stoah is</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.000" end="00:31:59.750" style="s2">treating interaction and and practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.600" end="00:32:01.429" style="s2">and this live event format and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.750" end="00:32:04.520" style="s2">someone said in the chat are they</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.429" end="00:32:07.159" style="s2">siblings are they lovers are they</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.520" end="00:32:09.429" style="s2">pentose so I don&#39;t know if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.159" end="00:32:12.740" style="s2">insight into that into that question</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.429" end="00:32:16.820" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;m curious Adams thoughts of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.740" end="00:32:19.010" style="s2">the others say that I have philia for</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.820" end="00:32:21.260" style="s2">the side view maybe it&#39;s just because we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.010" end="00:32:23.779" style="s2">have shared philosophical engages with</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.260" end="00:32:25.850" style="s2">hadou but it seems like we&#39;re gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.779" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">towards the same thing and so any form</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.850" end="00:32:30.529" style="s2">of collaboration that can emerge I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:32.029" style="s2">very open to it and he mentions a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.529" end="00:32:34.760" style="s2">question I wanted to answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.029" end="00:32:35.899" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t ask there but you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.760" end="00:32:37.490" style="s2">in the chat it&#39;s like how can you speak</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.899" end="00:32:39.980" style="s2">on your piece of memetic mediation as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.490" end="00:32:41.090" style="s2">stoic kind of compliment I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.980" end="00:32:43.340" style="s2">mention that just mentioned that briefly</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.090" end="00:32:45.830" style="s2">that Jason Jared and I we have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.340" end="00:32:49.100" style="s2">mediation campfire every Sunday here at</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.830" end="00:32:50.860" style="s2">the stove 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.100" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">talked about mimetic mediation how do</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.860" end="00:32:54.710" style="s2">and maybe one definition of that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:55.549" style="s2">getting different mimetic tribes or</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.710" end="00:32:58.370" style="s2">different memes into right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.549" end="00:33:00.919" style="s2">with each other and how to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.370" end="00:33:02.390" style="s2">the idea here is just invite people from</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.919" end="00:33:03.740" style="s2">all these different ideologies all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.390" end="00:33:05.630" style="s2">different philosophies in the wild to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.740" end="00:33:07.490" style="s2">get them warm by the digital campfire we</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.630" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">had Michael Brooks we have you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.490" end="00:33:11.899" style="s2">a progressive issed Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:13.820" style="s2">supporter we had Jack Murphy&#39;s a man&#39;&#39;ôs</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.899" end="00:33:15.860" style="s2">for your guy can to get warmer around</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.820" end="00:33:18.529" style="s2">the campfire and eventually can they or</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.860" end="00:33:20.570" style="s2">their you know followers come to dialog</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.529" end="00:33:22.130" style="s2">with each other in this space and so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.570" end="00:33:25.640" style="s2">kind of want the stoah to be this sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.130" end="00:33:26.510" style="s2">of space where people can engage so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.640" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">have a question for Jason but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.510" end="00:33:34.490" style="s2">curious if Adam has any any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">how many of that just yes I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.490" end="00:33:42.730" style="s2">the more the more we can do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:42.730" style="s2">cross-pollination the better I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.830" end="00:33:48.510" style="s2">I think about this you know one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.870" end="00:33:52.529" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of creating a sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.510" end="00:33:54.330" style="s2">artifact that people can look at but and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.529" end="00:33:57.390" style="s2">think about on their own but poor work</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.330" end="00:34:00.419" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of a question of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.390" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">culture and participating in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.419" end="00:34:06.539" style="s2">and just taking responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">fact that that culture doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.539" end="00:34:14.250" style="s2">happen it has to be made and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:18.330" style="s2">be made with some intention and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.250" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see you know as kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.330" end="00:34:22.740" style="s2">almost most important is that it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:27.480" style="s2">like whole communities spring up around</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.740" end="00:34:29.849" style="s2">these conversations you know and I have</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.480" end="00:34:33.389" style="s2">I have competencies and comfort zones</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.849" end="00:34:35.940" style="s2">that I just when I started the website I</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.389" end="00:34:37.889" style="s2">knew I knew it should be multimedia and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.940" end="00:34:40.050" style="s2">you it should be podcasts and events but</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.889" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">the podcasts have always been more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.050" end="00:34:44.970" style="s2">challenging for me just because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:48.389" style="s2">it&#39;s not where I feel highly competent</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.970" end="00:34:51.060" style="s2">but writing and editing and getting into</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.389" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas and back and forth you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.060" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">know I can do that you know all day long</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:59.700" style="s2">so I like the idea that we bring kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:02.280" style="s2">a different emphasis to the work that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.700" end="00:35:05.910" style="s2">do and I think that&#39;s important but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.280" end="00:35:10.109" style="s2">wonder Peter maybe we can sort of bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.910" end="00:35:14.280" style="s2">in some of the writers I you know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.109" end="00:35:17.460" style="s2">is mostly their work and me just trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.280" end="00:35:21.270" style="s2">to act as a kind of antenna slash</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.460" end="00:35:26.099" style="s2">facilitator so I mean so please yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.270" end="00:35:28.050" style="s2">have I see ray down there Brent I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.099" end="00:35:30.980" style="s2">see all of you but I you know I know</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.050" end="00:35:33.060" style="s2">you&#39;re out there so I&#39;m curious I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.980" end="00:35:34.170" style="s2">yeah Carter sort of time we have 20</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.060" end="00:35:37.430" style="s2">minutes do you have any questions to any</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.170" end="00:35:37.430" style="s2">of the writers I don&#39;t directly</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.869" end="00:35:48.440" style="s2">no I&#39;m just so happy that this all came</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.880" end="00:35:50.510" style="s2">together and I just I know you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.440" end="00:35:53.510" style="s2">having written for a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.510" end="00:35:55.369" style="s2">publications myself just how much of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.510" end="00:35:57.289" style="s2">labor of love it is and how frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.369" end="00:35:58.910" style="s2">it is and how like you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.289" end="00:36:01.730" style="s2">really grind your gears on this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.910" end="00:36:03.349" style="s2">stuff and then you know it&#39;s not like</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.369" end="00:36:49.420" style="s2">like to share it with the group</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.150" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">comment that you know this time of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.410" end="00:37:02.329" style="s2">physical separation has diso highlighted</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:04.279" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to just say the value of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.329" end="00:37:07.269" style="s2">community but the practice of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.279" end="00:37:10.910" style="s2">together that we&#39;re using these digital</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.269" end="00:37:12.500" style="s2">interfaces and zoom calls and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.910" end="00:37:15.619" style="s2">else we&#39;re doing like I used discord</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.500" end="00:37:17.630" style="s2">quite a bit to really kind of come at it</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.619" end="00:37:19.640" style="s2">as if it&#39;s a novelty right like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.630" end="00:37:23.569" style="s2">haven&#39;t really used the social space</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.640" end="00:37:25.700" style="s2">spaces online in my experience anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.569" end="00:37:27.829" style="s2">since their early days like this right</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.700" end="00:37:29.869" style="s2">when YouTube was brand-new and we could</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.829" end="00:37:33.049" style="s2">you know Matt Segal&#39;s on here we had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.869" end="00:37:34.460" style="s2">kind of an interesting video blog</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.049" end="00:37:35.900" style="s2">practice community where we would</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.460" end="00:37:37.819" style="s2">philosophize and send each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.900" end="00:37:39.980" style="s2">10-minute videos and replies and have</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.819" end="00:37:41.990" style="s2">like a reply thread through video and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.980" end="00:37:44.210" style="s2">was so exciting it felt so genuine you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.990" end="00:37:46.700" style="s2">know there&#39;s a kind of a genuineness I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.210" end="00:37:49.609" style="s2">think in the way we&#39;re using zoom and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.700" end="00:37:51.799" style="s2">social media today that perhaps we had</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.609" end="00:37:54.470" style="s2">taken for granted for quite a while so</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.799" end="00:37:56.390" style="s2">just sort of an interesting Anan Tod</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.470" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">reversal of the way we&#39;re coming up</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.390" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">these social technologies</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.780" end="00:38:09.940" style="s2">yeah totally raven you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.480" end="00:38:12.610" style="s2">that you got got a plus-one up she liked</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.940" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">to ask it yeah I would and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.610" end="00:38:17.170" style="s2">Greg also wrote an essay kind of about</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:18.430" style="s2">the subject so if he feels invited to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.170" end="00:38:20.350" style="s2">answer the question I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:23.380" style="s2">really love to hear from him so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.350" end="00:38:26.530" style="s2">was kind of there has been a critique</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.380" end="00:38:29.110" style="s2">that meta modernism and game B some of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.530" end="00:38:32.230" style="s2">these emerging sense-making communities</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.110" end="00:38:34.750" style="s2">are lacking aesthetics and I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.230" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">wondering if the side view and its play</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.750" end="00:38:40.750" style="s2">with mediums is an emergence of an</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:49.260" style="s2">artistic movement in association with</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.750" end="00:38:51.720" style="s2">these intellectual practical movement I</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.260" end="00:38:58.260" style="s2">mean I definitely think a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.720" end="00:39:03.630" style="s2">aesthetics aesthetics is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.260" end="00:39:07.349" style="s2">we think of aesthetics as like I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.630" end="00:39:09.480" style="s2">Tim Martin the philosopher had it right</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.349" end="00:39:10.829" style="s2">when he said we think of we think of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.480" end="00:39:13.020" style="s2">aesthetics as the sprinkles on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.829" end="00:39:17.780" style="s2">cupcake but they&#39;re they&#39;re really much</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.020" end="00:39:22.470" style="s2">deeper you know aesthetics really matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.780" end="00:39:25.740" style="s2">not just not just in the sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.470" end="00:39:30.030" style="s2">nice to look at nicely designed things</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.740" end="00:39:31.349" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually part of well</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.030" end="00:39:33.720" style="s2">they&#39;re certainly part of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.349" end="00:39:35.220" style="s2">of nature and they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.720" end="00:39:38.070" style="s2">structure of our well-being in some</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.220" end="00:39:43.010" style="s2">important way as for like artistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.070" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">movements I think these things are just</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.010" end="00:39:49.740" style="s2">they just erupt and there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:52.020" style="s2">no way to kind of say that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.740" end="00:39:53.849" style="s2">happening it&#39;s just you you learn after</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.020" end="00:39:56.339" style="s2">the fact and if you did it right</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.849" end="00:40:00.050" style="s2">somebody else will give you a label for</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.339" end="00:40:03.060" style="s2">what you did you know so I don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.050" end="00:40:05.460" style="s2">aesthetics yeah in general we should</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.060" end="00:40:08.300" style="s2">think more about it maybe Greg has</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.460" end="00:40:10.940" style="s2">something to say about meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.300" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2">Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.940" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">well I think my essay is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.000" end="00:40:26.220" style="s2">foreigner kind of in the world of the of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.109" end="00:40:29.790" style="s2">the volume and I&#39;m a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.220" end="00:40:35.300" style="s2">foreigner here in this chat so I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.790" end="00:40:38.700" style="s2">came to clarify what meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.300" end="00:40:41.030" style="s2">origins are as a term and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.700" end="00:40:43.950" style="s2">if you&#39;ve had a chance to read my essay</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.030" end="00:40:51.960" style="s2">but it actually originates as a theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.950" end="00:40:55.560" style="s2">of aesthetics specifically and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.960" end="00:40:57.150" style="s2">theory of contemporary aesthetics and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.560" end="00:41:03.260" style="s2">aesthetics that have kind of been at</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.150" end="00:41:07.260" style="s2">play since around 2000 so the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.260" end="00:41:09.950" style="s2">movement and the aesthetic artifacts and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.260" end="00:41:13.020" style="s2">cultural artifacts have already emerged</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.950" end="00:41:17.850" style="s2">and are all around</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.020" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">and then there&#39;s kind of this other</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.850" end="00:41:21.210" style="s2">sense of meta modern is of the word</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:23.360" style="s2">mount of modernism that I think maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.210" end="00:41:26.030" style="s2">lot of the people here are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.360" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">where it&#39;s a kind of proposed</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.030" end="00:41:34.230" style="s2">transformation to society and I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">can&#39;t really speak to whether it lacks</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.230" end="00:41:39.300" style="s2">the aesthetic dimension although coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.190" style="s2">from my perspective I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.300" end="00:41:46.680" style="s2">things that&#39;s kind of unique about game</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.190" end="00:41:52.410" style="s2">B is that it does have kind of a fun</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.680" end="00:41:54.180" style="s2">flavor to it that is almost an example</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.410" end="00:41:59.580" style="s2">of the kind of meta modernism that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.180" end="00:42:04.740" style="s2">talk about in my essay so I&#39;ll just look</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.580" end="00:42:06.180" style="s2">at that cool I just can I just get</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.740" end="00:42:09.240" style="s2">plugged greg&#39;s I say one more time</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.180" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">because he he actually gives you some</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.240" end="00:42:15.060" style="s2">really clear examples from you know like</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:18.030" style="s2">pop cultural references that you&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.060" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">kind of recognize immediately and it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.030" end="00:42:23.850" style="s2">actually reading Greg&#39;s essay where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:25.620" style="s2">sort of like it&#39;s like the idea of meta</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.850" end="00:42:28.530" style="s2">modernism sort of really clicked for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.620" end="00:42:33.270" style="s2">in a different way like what it was and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.530" end="00:42:35.190" style="s2">it was it was Greg&#39;s sort of just the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.270" end="00:42:38.730" style="s2">ease with which he was able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.190" end="00:42:40.770" style="s2">pull from the you know the cultural you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.730" end="00:42:42.120" style="s2">know regime of products and say here</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.770" end="00:42:43.290" style="s2">look at this and then if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.120" end="00:42:45.000" style="s2">this you&#39;ll see that the same thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.290" end="00:42:48.060" style="s2">going on here and if like I finally got</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.000" end="00:42:49.530" style="s2">the concept in a way where then I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.060" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">kind of like walking around being like</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.530" end="00:42:53.910" style="s2">oh and and this would also be an example</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:56.040" style="s2">right yeah okay I get it now like I I</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.910" end="00:42:57.870" style="s2">was able to like use it you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.040" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">finally learned how to use the word in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.870" end="00:43:04.140" style="s2">sentence so make sure you check it out</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:05.910" style="s2">beautiful and like I was just reading</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.140" end="00:43:07.740" style="s2">princess a too and had a good overview</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.910" end="00:43:09.660" style="s2">like the intellectual history of meta</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.740" end="00:43:13.020" style="s2">modernism so these they seem like they</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.660" end="00:43:15.870" style="s2">really complement each other and so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.020" end="00:43:17.160" style="s2">have about 15 minutes we&#39;ll still</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.870" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">continue with the structured format and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.160" end="00:43:20.390" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have like a sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">free-for-all when we stop pressing</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.390" end="00:43:25.979" style="s2">record so you can hold on for that but</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:28.389" style="s2">Bonita I know you said he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.979" end="00:43:34.479" style="s2">add something there no no I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.389" end="00:43:46.119" style="s2">to David&#39;s question yeah so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.479" end="00:43:48.789" style="s2">geek out here little so aesthetics so</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.119" end="00:43:51.089" style="s2">I&#39;m going to go back to caught maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.789" end="00:43:53.829" style="s2">Adam you can follow up after I say this</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.089" end="00:43:56.349" style="s2">yet three critiques get a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.829" end="00:43:59.529" style="s2">pure reason and it could take a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.349" end="00:44:03.699" style="s2">practical reason and he had a critique</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.529" end="00:44:08.529" style="s2">of judgemental reason and the only way</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.699" end="00:44:11.729" style="s2">out is aesthetic reason and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.529" end="00:44:15.669" style="s2">difference between all of those is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.729" end="00:44:19.149" style="s2">aesthetic reason so I want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.669" end="00:44:22.209" style="s2">like what we need to add but and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.149" end="00:44:23.949" style="s2">the side view is is doing this like it</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.209" end="00:44:27.789" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have pictures and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.949" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">have artists but we Adam looks at their</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.789" end="00:44:33.519" style="s2">work not from pure reasons yes from</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:35.049" style="s2">practical reason not from judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.519" end="00:44:37.349" style="s2">reasons but I think he has this more</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.049" end="00:44:42.069" style="s2">like this aesthetic reason which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.349" end="00:44:46.479" style="s2">every piece stands on its own in its</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.069" end="00:44:50.259" style="s2">hole in its kind of concrete Universal</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.479" end="00:44:53.349" style="s2">in its own expression so you can&#39;t judge</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.259" end="00:44:57.789" style="s2">like this Vermeer is that this level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:45:00.429" style="s2">consciousness and this you know Jackson</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.789" end="00:45:02.589" style="s2">Pollock you know it&#39;s not this this</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.429" end="00:45:05.819" style="s2">judgmental there&#39;s not a rational</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.589" end="00:45:09.039" style="s2">approach I think that when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.819" end="00:45:11.169" style="s2">what it is that the site view is doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.039" end="00:45:14.229" style="s2">or what it is that we should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.169" end="00:45:18.519" style="s2">this notion of aesthetic reasoning I</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.229" end="00:45:25.529" style="s2">think is is key and you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.519" end="00:45:27.729" style="s2">wanted to make this statement but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.529" end="00:45:31.539" style="s2">just want to comment real quickly</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.729" end="00:45:34.899" style="s2">because Matt Matt Siegal linked in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.539" end="00:45:38.060" style="s2">chat to an essay that was published in</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.899" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">issue 2 by heidi Gustafson of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.060" end="00:45:44.380" style="s2">of ours and she has some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:47.300" style="s2">anesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.380" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">some kind of a I don&#39;t know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.300" end="00:45:53.930" style="s2">a magical intuition in her painting but</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:56.900" style="s2">also in she actually sources all of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.930" end="00:45:59.740" style="s2">minerals for her paints and she writes</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.900" end="00:46:04.940" style="s2">in her essay about how she does that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.740" end="00:46:09.230" style="s2">she is driven by an intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.940" end="00:46:11.720" style="s2">not the kind of explicit rationality</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.230" end="00:46:14.870" style="s2">that would typically be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.720" end="00:46:17.900" style="s2">sort of like going out into a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.870" end="00:46:19.850" style="s2">and finding minerals and I think Juanita</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.900" end="00:46:22.460" style="s2">is right there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.850" end="00:46:24.320" style="s2">signal there and I try to translate</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.460" end="00:46:26.690" style="s2">whatever signal I&#39;m getting into some</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.320" end="00:46:33.620" style="s2">kind of aesthetic for each for each</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.690" end="00:46:39.260" style="s2">piece cool David you had a question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.620" end="00:46:44.900" style="s2">oh yeah yeah David add questions to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.260" end="00:46:47.240" style="s2">Jason okay thank you I think I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.900" end="00:46:49.700" style="s2">in response to your Benitez question</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.240" end="00:46:52.490" style="s2">that he was surprised by the Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.700" end="00:46:54.860" style="s2">connection that Peter and Christopher</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.860" end="00:47:00.950" style="s2">from before but I happen to know it goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.560" end="00:47:03.320" style="s2">quite a bit deeper than that because I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.950" end="00:47:06.740" style="s2">see guys interacting in Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.320" end="00:47:10.900" style="s2">guesting on each other&#39;s podcasts and in</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.780" end="00:48:43.120" style="s2">you know intelligence collective</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.300" end="00:48:45.730" style="s2">intelligence you know sharing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.120" end="00:48:48.550" style="s2">emerging ideas that I just try and keep</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.730" end="00:48:51.070" style="s2">up and you know try and get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.550" end="00:48:53.470" style="s2">you know what is like some small little</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.070" end="00:48:55.510" style="s2">area that I can contribute to you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.470" end="00:48:56.710" style="s2">in terms of you know perhaps there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.510" end="00:48:59.860" style="s2">some kind of misunderstanding between</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.710" end="00:49:01.270" style="s2">you know one particular person that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.860" end="00:49:03.310" style="s2">you know that we might find on our</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.270" end="00:49:05.890" style="s2">podcast or another and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.310" end="00:49:07.840" style="s2">mimetic mediation comes in is like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.890" end="00:49:09.640" style="s2">just kind of like where where can there</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.840" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">be a little bit more signal transfer</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.640" end="00:49:12.910" style="s2">instead of noise transfer and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:14.710" style="s2">is there is this a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.910" end="00:49:18.090" style="s2">disagreement that cannot be resolved or</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.710" end="00:49:22.180" style="s2">is it some kind of misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.090" end="00:49:23.620" style="s2">yeah and Jason I were supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.180" end="00:49:25.180" style="s2">actually write a piece together but we</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.620" end="00:49:27.390" style="s2">couldn&#39;t mediate a motion our selves so</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.180" end="00:49:29.830" style="s2">we did separate pieces</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.390" end="00:49:31.540" style="s2">Danita that was one thing that surprised</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.830" end="00:49:33.400" style="s2">me I forgot about that they were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.540" end="00:49:35.400" style="s2">co-write this piece and then I get an</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.400" end="00:49:36.779" style="s2">email I get one email from both of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.400" end="00:49:39.510" style="s2">basically at the same time they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.779" end="00:49:42.140" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna work like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.510" end="00:49:48.450" style="s2">mediators can&#39;t write a mediation piece</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.140" end="00:49:50.210" style="s2">what is going on yeah like the real</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.450" end="00:49:53.279" style="s2">story as Peter didn&#39;t like what I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.210" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">and he was like I don&#39;t want this to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.279" end="00:49:58.490" style="s2">part of my brand or something</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:58.490" style="s2">I think that&#39;s unshared of it to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.650" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">but I let it sit I&#39;ll be stoic about</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.329" end="00:50:04.500" style="s2">that the misinformation that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:06.150" style="s2">providing them I&#39;m hoping that I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.500" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">mediate the two of them and then the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.150" end="00:50:13.980" style="s2">third wheel here and usually I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:15.510" style="s2">a third wheel between you two so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.980" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">glad the roles have changed</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.510" end="00:50:23.460" style="s2">Jerry got to drive a point home but if</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.980" style="s2">we adopted aesthetic judgment we would</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.460" end="00:50:31.230" style="s2">not need the realm of ideas to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.980" end="00:50:35.819" style="s2">mediated we would not argue over what</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.230" end="00:50:38.359" style="s2">painting deserves a key point for my</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.819" end="00:50:41.250" style="s2">essay is that the engine of mediation is</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.359" end="00:50:43.230" style="s2">from a keg in stage three point of view</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.250" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">which is relational and aesthetic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.230" end="00:50:46.680" style="s2">the connection I try to make and so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:51.049" style="s2">agree with you juanita</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.680" end="00:50:54.539" style="s2">that often times sub ideological</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.049" end="00:50:56.579" style="s2">aesthetic and you know relational</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.539" end="00:51:01.500" style="s2">connection is much more powerful than</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.579" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">anything else so I&#39;m going to jump in</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.500" end="00:51:05.130" style="s2">because this is getting fun so I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:06.390" style="s2">we should pivot to the sense making a</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.130" end="00:51:08.730" style="s2">question we only have five minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.390" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">of the allotted time for the recorded</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.730" end="00:51:14.309" style="s2">portion before I hit it over and hand it</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:17.970" style="s2">to Raven Adam gave any kind of closing</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.309" end="00:51:20.789" style="s2">thoughts about you know the episode of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.970" end="00:51:22.920" style="s2">the issue or whatever I don&#39;t but I if</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.789" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">we have five minutes and if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:30.619" style="s2">something and you haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.809" end="00:51:30.619" style="s2">please take five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.490" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">and again we have 30 plus minutes</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.660" end="00:51:39.600" style="s2">afterwards to the jam together but if</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:42.510" style="s2">anyone wants to say anything up for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.600" end="00:51:45.270" style="s2">reported portion I&#39;m a past contributor</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.410" end="00:53:13.070" style="s2">this question at first it felt really</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.530" end="00:53:15.230" style="s2">inadequate like I didn&#39;t have a like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.070" end="00:53:17.840" style="s2">felt like people were asking for like</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.020" end="00:53:43.559" style="s2">started giving lists of like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.870" end="00:53:47.759" style="s2">practices that I had and then I had an</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.559" end="00:53:50.249" style="s2">teacher of my mind just kind of comment</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.759" end="00:53:53.819" style="s2">like oh you&#39;re just so forthright about</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.249" end="00:53:55.229" style="s2">all of that and he was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.819" end="00:53:56.759" style="s2">he&#39;s an older gentleman he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.229" end="00:53:59.249" style="s2">like you know in my day we used to kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.759" end="00:54:01.559" style="s2">of we were we weren&#39;t so open about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.249" end="00:54:02.999" style="s2">good - it&#39;s good to show don&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.559" end="00:54:05.819" style="s2">you know and I kind of then I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.999" end="00:54:09.209" style="s2">like all of a sudden I felt like I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.819" end="00:54:10.859" style="s2">being sort of silly or crass so my</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.209" end="00:54:14.519" style="s2">relationship to that question changed</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.859" end="00:54:16.140" style="s2">again and so now like you know and Jason</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.519" end="00:54:18.150" style="s2">actually says something similar in his</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.140" end="00:54:20.189" style="s2">piece cuz we were at when we were</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.150" end="00:54:22.529" style="s2">editing it I was kind of like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.189" end="00:54:25.799" style="s2">how does it work you know like take me</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.529" end="00:54:28.049" style="s2">through like some examples of how you</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.799" end="00:54:31.140" style="s2">would how you do this mediation work and</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.049" end="00:54:34.589" style="s2">he just wrote an essay you know like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.140" end="00:54:37.049" style="s2">not gonna formalize this into a pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.589" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have practices and they they</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.049" end="00:54:44.039" style="s2">produce results but I we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:46.650" style="s2">need to create this like bulleted list</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.039" end="00:54:48.209" style="s2">of things and so I keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.650" end="00:54:51.989" style="s2">the question of like how do I answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.209" end="00:54:53.579" style="s2">that question and I really don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.989" end="00:54:55.859" style="s2">like what a good answer for that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.579" end="00:55:00.619" style="s2">question is other than you know I could</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.859" end="00:55:05.689" style="s2">tell you like like silent meditation</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.619" end="00:55:08.719" style="s2">martial arts reading study contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.689" end="00:55:12.420" style="s2">all of these things but that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.719" end="00:55:15.299" style="s2">yeah that is what it is but I think in</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.420" end="00:55:16.890" style="s2">some sense it comes down to something</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.299" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">else it some it comes down to something</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.890" end="00:55:28.249" style="s2">like having trust so that your intuition</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:30.599" style="s2">goes somewhere and then one figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.249" end="00:55:35.069" style="s2">what the fuck is your intuition actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.599" end="00:55:37.739" style="s2">saying and to like follow it through and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.069" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.739" end="00:55:43.979" style="s2">lot of issues that crop up dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:45.959" style="s2">both of those sides of it and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.979" end="00:55:49.650" style="s2">practices are about getting clear on</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.959" end="00:55:52.289" style="s2">what that is and then sort of being able</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.650" end="00:55:53.850" style="s2">to pursue it even when all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.289" end="00:55:56.070" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.850" end="00:55:59.220" style="s2">throw you off course or try to convince</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.070" end="00:56:03.530" style="s2">you this is sometimes those convincing</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.220" end="00:56:07.410" style="s2">you know take the shape of insecurity or</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.530" end="00:56:09.240" style="s2">negative comment or some other</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.410" end="00:56:11.070" style="s2">extenuating circumstance that demands</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.240" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">your attention so it&#39;s just like how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.070" end="00:56:18.090" style="s2">you staying focused on that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">just to kind of bring it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.090" end="00:56:22.440" style="s2">second half of what David was saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:26.220" style="s2">just just that thing is whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.440" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">side view is trying to be and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.220" end="00:56:30.390" style="s2">lot on my side that goes into</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.390" end="00:56:37.590" style="s2">these different facets but like staying</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.510" end="00:56:42.870" style="s2">on that line is is what the practice is</p>
