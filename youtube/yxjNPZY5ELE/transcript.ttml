<p begin="00:00:03.199" end="00:00:06.240" style="s2">the stoa is a digital campfire where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.680" end="00:00:08.800" style="s2">cohere</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">and dialogue about what matters most at</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.800" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">the knife&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.160" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">okay there you go all right great</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.960" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">stop interrupting me okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.800" end="00:00:30.960" style="s2">all right so yeah last time we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:33.040" style="s2">talked about what the metagame</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.960" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">meant for each of us and it&#39;s a concept</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.040" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">that is evolving in people&#39;s heads</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">organically</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">people have different conceptions of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">what it is um</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">one of the founder of the store peter</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">she talks about coming into right</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.239" end="00:00:49.760" style="s2">relationship with ecology of games that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:52.160" style="s2">we&#39;re currently playing</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">and i really like that that concept of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.160" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">right relationship i think it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">of what we&#39;re getting at here and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">i i guess i would like to build on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.640" style="s2">so i i conceive of the metagame as</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">knowing which tools to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">how and when to use them and knowing how</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">we want to put them down</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">and i think this last part is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:17.600" style="s2">fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">right relationship uh we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.600" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">this is something we also talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">anyway you&#39;ve heard of this book by</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">this gentleman eric from hands in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">chat anybody no</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">okay yeah david do i okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:37.360" style="s2">escape from freedom but oh okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">yeah this one is i think is might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.360" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">more popular than that one but</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">escape from freedoms is popular too</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">um so we just went through anybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">wanted to give a recap of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">i guess this book is about and what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">talked about anybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">just anybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.040" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">wait</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">one second say something sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">sure i wouldn&#39;t want to recap it but i</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">just felt it was sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">complicated way of talking about being</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">self-centered or being compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">sorry i thought it was simply uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">the dichotomy between being</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">self-centered</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">or being compassionate it would be more</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">put it that way okay interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">yeah and another thing that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">people brought up is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not so much the particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;s being done but the intention</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">behind it that&#39;s kind of related to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">having right relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">choosing instead of allowing something</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">to choose for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">um so yeah we talked about that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">uh you know we really showed examples of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">where it shows up in different</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">situations different books people</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">have talked about these things uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">through over time</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">throughout the time and religions kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">of call ideology when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">when you&#39;re operating in the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">so sorry i have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">some people who weren&#39;t here i guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">generally speaking the having mode is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">eric from talks about a way of being in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">the world that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">where you um</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">you&#39;re acting from an acquisitive uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">existential mode so you this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">use a bunch of this cluster of words</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">here to kind of give you a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">the having mode is um</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">so possessing consuming idolizing these</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">are a kind of way to have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">wrong relationship with certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">stimuli in the world and student objects</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">and it&#39;s more reactive than responsive</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s less of having a choice and being</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">chosen for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">um so he talks about how you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">advertising industry</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">encourages to confuse these two modes so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">so they try to convince you that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">order to be in order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">express your creativity you need certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">things you need to have certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">status symbols certain uh products and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">etc and this kind of modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">um is is kind of prevalent in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">consumer society</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s something that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">contend with almost every day</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">um so yeah we talked about specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:26.840" style="s2">examples different</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">in different texts and different</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">traditions um</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">yeah so then we had a breakout session</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">this is one of my best friends</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">he always used to um advocate having</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">creative desires or possessive desires i</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">thought that was very related</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">and we had a breakout session talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">um talking about our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">uh possessive desires our own creative</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">desires and how they&#39;re related</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">and i think this is where we we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">this is where we left off</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">because i&#39;m going to continue this this</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">process and then we&#39;ll have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">more breakout sessions</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">and hopefully we&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">end this time</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">um so yeah anybody has</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">often is familiar with uh extended</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">or uh the concept of extended cognition</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">no no not really so uh extended</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">cognition is just the idea is that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">we think through or with tools so we use</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">thinking tools whether it&#39;s uh physical</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">social technologies or</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">psychotechnologies or</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">and those things are kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">amorphous sets that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">sometimes things overlap in them but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">idea is that we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t really think purely we think</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">through different things</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">think through a language we think</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">through different concepts we think</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">through institutions</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">and even think through like physical</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">objects</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">they form our ontology our our</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">apparatus for interacting with the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">so so they kind of um they&#39;re repo</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">if you study like media theory you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">how these tools that we we use they kind</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">when you hold a screwdriver your brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">models the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">length of your arm as the to the tip of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">the screwdriver yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">so we&#39;re just like naturally geared to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">extending the boundaries of itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">exactly yeah this is precisely what i</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">was getting at</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">and i guess you&#39;ll see further what i um</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">how am i thinking of how this develops</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s precisely what i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">trying to get out here</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">um so yeah so this can be a problem uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">this is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">confusion is you know uh genre he talks</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">about confusion being</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">uh fused with you being fused with and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">here are some examples of some tweets uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">in my my</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">feed of i think a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">confusion that happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">unconsciously it&#39;s without choice and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">you kind of fuse yourself with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">tools that you&#39;re using so if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">could read the first one it says</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve adopted i&#39;ve opted into a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">strict community</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">structure and schedule where my time to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">engage with tech is significantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">reduced</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">i feel like part of my brain has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">cut off like i&#39;ve been lobotomized</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">really struggling to get back to analog</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">when i was 90 digital</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">tips to adapt so basically the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">that this person</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">got through usage of this of these tools</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">uh medium kind of got fused with it got</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">confused with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">and um the person felt like</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">they lost part of themselves when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">hear people say i can&#39;t live without</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">this thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">attachments that happens naturally</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">and a problem with this is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">uh when these attachments get attacked</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">and we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">our we ourselves are being attacked</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">because we drew our boundary around that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">so whether it&#39;s like an ideology or like</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">in the second example you can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">you know i this says i can live without</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">the nba or the mlb</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">but i can&#39;t flip without the nfl so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">the person arbitrarily drew the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">of themselves around the nfl</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">and when that gets threatened they feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">they feel threatened and you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">extrapolate</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">the political ideologies or even things</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">in your objects in your life</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">like a car or something like that um</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">so you guys are familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">experiment where uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">just show of hands people are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">with this experiment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty famous here um anybody want</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">to give a shot at</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">explaining it i think i want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">encourage you guys to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">help me out here</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">oh everyone who raised their hand i want</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">one person to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">try to give uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">so when he hits</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">the fake arm his he&#39;ll react</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">as if as it like is an internal</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">experience he&#39;ll react as if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">actually hurting him</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">because i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">the boundary like his mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">sees that fake hand as his real hand</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">and kind of reminds me of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">like when people don&#39;t have like get</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">their arm chopped off or something they</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">still have those phantom</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">sensations or whatever yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">no yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">precisely it</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">and um prior to prior to that experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">of feeling like your your arm has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">intact</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">they kind of stimulate it um you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">experienced stimulation with it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">the more you mediate yourself uh through</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">an object or</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">perceive to be mediating yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">through an object the more you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">attached to it kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">naturally our brain kind of does that so</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a really good</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">myself was like shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">kind of like a computer is shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">and then the first night at my new place</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">i could feel that i&#39;m rebooting with</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">different elements of myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">and there were certain applications that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">weren&#39;t there certain parts of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">identity that wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">that i had to rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">that&#39;s extremely interesting that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">analogy with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">applications that that&#39;s very salient to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">me right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">yeah and i think as we go on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">presentation it can become</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">obvious why but yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting even that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">had any kind of awareness to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">to perceive that happening in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">um anybody else want to share or ron</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">uh just one fundamental maybe thing we</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">came up with and shout out to matthew</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">for this</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">is that this is mostly an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">process that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">obviously we could maybe consciously or</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">when we&#39;re smart to say yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">screwdriver is not part of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">arm but the idea is that at some level</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">your unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">is making it and it could be the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">with lots of stuff so it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">knowing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">identifying or making part of ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">again shout out to matthew used a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">example of driving a car and we all know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">our unconscious can drive the car while</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">uh in a sense so it&#39;s makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">trickier thing if we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">these processes are refused</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">so to speak yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">i mean and i guess people will get to</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">later on too but i guess that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">kind of developed different rituals</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">um to kind of shut down those apps</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">that you know we don&#39;t realize are</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">running in the background</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">me that i&#39;ve had experiences with</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">as quickly as i would make it stop it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">was because the person was not driving</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">that i would drive my car and it felt</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">very uncomfortable because</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">um and i encourage you to look at the</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">we can talk about it some more um so</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">so i so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">how do we well one of the questions we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">had the breakout session was</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">what do you do about this proclivity to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">kind of accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">attachments accumulate things and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">i i want to introduce this term called</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">ontological breathing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">so the ideas is kind of straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">you might have guessed it by now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">just um</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">oscillating between contemplation and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:12.640" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">and so that you don&#39;t have apps running</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.640" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">inefficiently in the background so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">um you put your tools down through</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">meditation you observe</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">your biases and your your tools that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">you&#39;re using your attachments</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">you contemplate you you meditate on</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">your attachments and you kind of put</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">them down you make a decision to put</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">them down</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">and that affords you the resources to to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">reach the contemplative heights that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">give your life um</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2">a sense of meaning a deeper meaning give</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">you the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">the skills of apprehending reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">with high fidelity uh so you talk so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">people from religious uh religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">backgrounds to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">you know scientists talking about um</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">reaching transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">hype through the contemplation you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">einstein or</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">eric weinstein or</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">the the church fathers many many</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">centuries ago so</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">um so so the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">is you know using the analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">breathing inspiration is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">you&#39;re getting you inspired from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">world so you you you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">up you go further into reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">expiration of self is you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:31.200" style="s2">getting rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">you dropping the applets that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.200" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">running on in the background</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">you&#39;re dropping the attachments and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">you&#39;re expiring that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">so yeah if you you look at these</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">self-worth nexus</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re you&#39;re gathering</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">you&#39;re gathering of resources</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">to to kind of have to to apply them</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">to apprehending reality in a in a more</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">effectual way</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">um so yeah the bottom the bottom section</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">what i think i ten what i think we tend</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">to how we i think we tend to be more so</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">often we kind of just have these</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">uh random attachments that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">sure we&#39;re not we&#39;re not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">um whether it&#39;s different um</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">ideologies different ideas different</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">models in which we</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">um or narratives stories we tell</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">ourselves i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">uh paying attention to stories that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">you&#39;re telling yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">and who you think you are in that story</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">so uh this is one way i&#39;ve come to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">how to maintain the kind of healthy</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">um because we kind of have to use tools</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">right we kind of we obviously have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">use tools</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">so kind of ritualizing putting them down</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">we can pick them back up again in a more</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">effectual way</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like trying to play tennis</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">spatula it&#39;s like a frying pan in your</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">hand you have to put them down</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">to pick up the tennis racket so that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">can play properly</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">but i want to know if if this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">conceptualization is</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">useful or makes sense to anybody or um</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">any tips on how i can think about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">in a better way or if anybody&#39;s heard a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">better way of thinking about this we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">have more breakup sessions but</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">yeah um i have one so if this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">if this is ontological breathing when</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">you refer to tools</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">what are you referring to because tools</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">and equipment</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">have a very definitive purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">within ontology okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ve talked about that more like</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">so within phenomenology and ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">the works of herdigo</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">equipment and tools of things and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">objects we um</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">interact with and their purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">depends on their handiness and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">ready if they&#39;re ready for hand or</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">if they are just present at hand and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">defines whether they just simply an</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">object like dirt</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">or if they&#39;re a tool like a phone or</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">like a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">or simmer so if we just sort of think</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">about like our phones our computer</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">a book that&#39;s all in one sense so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">equipment but if we&#39;re thinking in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">other sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">there are a lot of other things we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">to sort of disconnect from and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">uh get rid of our attachment from before</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">we can get into the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">mindset that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">so i guess um</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">how anybody else want to chime in on</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">i i guess the way i look at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">i i don&#39;t agree with your definition and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">contemplation is one of these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">you can contemplate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that be average um</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t disagreeing with that oh no no</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">i think he was disagreeing with my</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">not yours andre okay no no yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah okay i appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">i was i was um i liked</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:10.559" style="s2">john vicki&#39;s um distinction</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like all models</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">are kind of wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">uh sometimes they&#39;re useful um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">thanks for that feedback</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">um so sorry um yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">also just um discussing this and showing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">uh it brought up ideas from</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">uh alchemical cognition i think is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">of uh you know how</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">breaking out of the box thinking out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">the box using</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">ways of ways of you know cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">approaches</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">um that seem counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">and in that something that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">is that in ritual</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">even the taking up of tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">laying down of tools</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.159" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">themselves can be rituals and or</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">meaningful themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">and could themselves be contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">states or meditative states</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">um so i think that&#39;s maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.039" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">interesting to explore</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">so that it doesn&#39;t necessarily become a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">not not that i think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">you were saying but you know just</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">looking at a 2d picture it almost seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">there&#39;s this you know let&#39;s go up to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.039" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">state as a goal let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">you know then down again to that state</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">as a goal but even</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">seeing the process as</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">uh maybe not maybe not as a journey to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">the destination but actually as</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">processes themselves and the transition</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">having properties that might be unique</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">to the transition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">that might be different from you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">yeah then one transition state so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">no yeah i totally get it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like not not you</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">maybe not so much you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">these things as like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">end states but pretty in particular but</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">the journey through them the rituals</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">um shape the journey from one to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">in itself is an important uh thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">i like that um</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">but yeah so i i just like the i guess a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">way to look at this is like you know to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">a hammer everything looks like a nail</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">so if you want to apprehend the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">properly you kind of have to put the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">hammer down and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">maybe pick up some other tools but</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">so let&#39;s so the the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">so the idea that you kind of have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">kind of learn how to die you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">old very old classical uh philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">and i just really like uh this gentleman</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">here at kona west anyone know conor</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">west yeah some people okay i love this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">so but yeah basically um you know he</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t talk about truth without</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">talking about learning how to die</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s precisely about learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">how to die</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">examining yourself and transforming the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">old self interval so that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">live more</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">intensely and critical critically and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">abundantly so the idea of like killing</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">killing the self is is is what i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">they mean by</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">putting putting tools down or putting</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">sorry putting the conceptions down that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">your your attachments down</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">um and you know we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">i want to know what you guys think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">difference but if if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">difference between contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">and meditation if there is just some</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">type of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">semantics that&#39;s not useful i want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">hear what you guys have to say maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">can just</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">you know casually uh chat here</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">can you contemplate using an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">cognition you know through different</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">modes other than um</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">mental abstractions uh can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">contemplate with your hands i wanna i</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">wanna hear what you guys</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">um think about that you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">feel free to unmute yourself i</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">i think the first thing that came up</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">um distinction um</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">the buddhist distinction between like</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">analytical</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">i guess just meditation i forget the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">names but yeah it&#39;s something like where</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">you use analytical</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">meditation to just sort of contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">something and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">get a sense of that thing as a felt</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">sense and then you can meditate on that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">felt sense to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:46.399" style="s2">like dye your soul with it so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying so</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">you kind of use kind of both in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">relation to each other to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">to kind of supplement each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">any anybody has ever thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">thing this distinction before</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">and if so does it how do you make sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">something that came up for me uh khalid</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">maybe a bit of like a metaphor or</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">analogy is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">uh something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about the meditative</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">state it&#39;s almost like creating a space</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">right it&#39;s about that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">approaching a state of nothingness right</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">like putting the tools down</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s more about the space than the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">thing you use the space in and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">contemplation is</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">that place where the focus is on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">thing you use within the space</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">so both the thing and the space is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">important because that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">situation the context</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">two that maybe there&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">hidden dimension to it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">because there&#39;s a relationship i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">know if that makes sense it&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">came up i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">any of that fits the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">no yeah i i kind of i you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">interesting as because</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">what you did with both of your shares</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">because you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">added that dimensionality to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">talking about which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">extremely very cool i like it</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">um but yeah the relationship it&#39;s itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">is like a another</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">optimization problem to use uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s in itself it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">challenging thing yeah i think it can</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">help describe</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">it from a perspective from a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">perspective right it can describe</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">the relationship can be perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">describe contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">from and committed you know meditation</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">yeah from as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">yeah yeah i&#39;ve got an idea on that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">definition so when we meditate</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">we try and connect to the ethereal plane</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">sort of another dimension and other</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">things arise mystically and then we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">focus on them and let them go but when</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">we contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">we try and grasp onto things that come</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">from the ethereal</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">and then not let them go we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">them consciously and examine them</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">but then we have the choice to let them</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">go if we want</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">yeah wanting to build on top of that um</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">that&#39;s a major distinction that i see</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">with contemplation it seems that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">creating a reality and really holding on</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">to it within</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">your um when whatever space you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">and meditation is the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">take that all apart and take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">the individual pieces</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s generally in line</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">with my my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">and i think um as has been brought up</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">here i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">you you kind of have to obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">do both to do it um</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">to kind of enrich your life and to to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">them uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">maybe to contemplate deeply you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">have to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">to to meditate or</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not not necessary maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">people are just talented and can</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">can do it but i feel like it it helps</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">it helps out a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">well anyway so we maybe we&#39;ll do a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">breakout session i want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">i want to know i want to source you guys</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">um you know do you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">engaged in any meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">and are they related for you in any way</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">i want to hear my experiences but</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to break you guys out and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">maybe you can come back with some</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">about anybody you want to start</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">share first</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna call on someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">i&#39;m going to call on megan okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">we uh we got to an interesting topic uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">right at the end</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">about um the idea of sort of doing doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">activities as simple activities</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">and possibly sort of self-caring</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">activities</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">um in a meditative or a contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">state um</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">so andre was talking about um the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">of sweeping as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">zen meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">and i added to that the idea of um doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">the dishes as a meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">um there&#39;s a there was a phase when i</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">was feeling really frustrated that i had</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">to do household tasks and i didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">enough time to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:45.760" style="s2">so um and obviously feeling frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">and not having enough time to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.760" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">is very</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">counterproductive if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">you know cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">quality meditation um so</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">it was really useful to realize that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">know it&#39;s possible to cultivate that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">meditative and or contemplative state</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">while doing activities um you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">walking the dog or</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">doing your laundry um whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:10.400" style="s2">doing especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">if it&#39;s sort of angled towards some kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">of self-care um</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">then it&#39;s it&#39;s actually really valuable</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:19.119" style="s2">to to be cultivating that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">state we didn&#39;t get as far as to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.119" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">distinguish between the meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">the contemplation while doing one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">these activities</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">but um and maybe someone else has</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">something to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">yeah thanks for sharing</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">anybody else wanna piggyback on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">oh maybe he was saying bye</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">and um i sometimes like thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">things</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">like to think about both but like one</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">big thing is it&#39;s just a fucking break</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">from the contemplation i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">guess i think of you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">even like the thoughts racing in my head</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">as like a version of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">you know light contemplation but that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">like can go on</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:32.320" style="s2">unchecked for like 24 7. so at points in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">my life i&#39;ve even just been like</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.320" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know just like it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">to know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a break but at points though when i</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">realize it&#39;s a break it helps to shape</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not your reality because one reason</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">why i think people should meditate more</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">is i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of people probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">in the united states who don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">realize that they&#39;re thinking in words</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">and like i don&#39;t know it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">cake of mine but like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">that is shaping their reality and like</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">meditation at least shows you like</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">not that there&#39;s this like light at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">end of the tunnel but like</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s possible not to be like that all</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:11.440" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s a good makes it</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">the relationship with the contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">healthier i guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">yeah but yeah that&#39;s why i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">it on the same continuous as</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">as you said like you your mind is racing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">but as you said at the end um knowing</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">control that better makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">effective when you decide to actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">pursue one of the threads in your head</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">excellent um</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">can i just just double click on the um</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">on how you said</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">like controlling the thoughts in your</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">head um that was an idea that i started</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">off with</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">um and i think like having that idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">you know the practice of meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">practicing controlling your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">um i decided after a while about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">actually been quite like that had been</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">quite an unhelpful framework that i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">been working in</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:12.320" style="s2">um because i wasn&#39;t very successful at</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">controlling my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.320" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">um just just to clarify when i said</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">control i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">i was talking about the contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">side but</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know if it makes it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">meaningful distinction or not but</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">anyway yeah i feel like it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">still relevant like um i guess uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a slightly it&#39;s a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">different idea that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">that i had which was that you know by</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">practicing meditation i&#39;m practicing you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">know forcing my thoughts to all shut up</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">for a little while so i can meditate you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">um but it&#39;s this it&#39;s the same idea if</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re contemplating versus</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">meditating whether there&#39;s thoughts in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">there um</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the distinction we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">playing with at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">um but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">the idea i came to is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">um you can practice you know recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">or understanding your thoughts or um</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">seeing your thoughts all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">which is not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">same dynamic as controlling them or</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">suppressing them or forcing them to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">this or that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">um and if well i found that if i start</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">that different angle on you know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">i&#39;m doing with my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">when trying to meditate um that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">well it became a much more positive</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">process the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">um and i found i don&#39;t want to say like</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">successful but i found i was much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">successful at it</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">with that with that basis and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">framework in there no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:44.720" style="s2">i guess the um the idea of control</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">is is co is consonant with the having</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.720" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">mode that we talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:48.480" style="s2">beginning the having word rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">being modest</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.480" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">the being always kind of yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">that&#39;s thank you for bringing</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:58.800" style="s2">up that back to everyone&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">um we have well yeah we&#39;re kind of over</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">time but i want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">if anyone else has um thoughts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">stuff in the chat going off of anyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.599" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">before one of the things that um</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">you know that came up during chatting</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">about the questions is</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">that you know you get different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">or different approaches to meditation</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">different frameworks of meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">you know perhaps uh that might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">generally more well understood because</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s language for that these books on</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">but contemplation for at least me</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure how to think about it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">different ways and different styles and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">different approaches</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s i guess simply because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">looked at i&#39;ve never thought about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">idea even that there might be different</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">ways of contemplating right</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">whereas different forms of meditating</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">our case came up because of</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">exactly what you know megan was</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">explaining there you know based on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">person&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">you know different ways of approaching</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">meditation can can work and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:03.520" style="s2">also i guess depending on the person for</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">different purposes um</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s something interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">explore like uh so if we discuss ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">of meditation and contemplation it would</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">from more from speaking from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">preference right</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">as a person like what how i understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">meditation because of my preferred way</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">of meditating and the same with</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">so there might be a whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">domain to discuss in contemplation with</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">different facets and approaches and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">same with meditation and that would</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">put a completely different you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">angle on the whole conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">um and another thing is i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s clear from your presentation that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">there&#39;s an like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">this idea of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">maybe i don&#39;t know a passive state</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">meditating and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">more active state contemplating or at</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">least from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">what everybody was sharing it was this</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">idea of you&#39;re actively doing something</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">contemplating and it&#39;s kind of you like</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">trying to let go when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">meditating that idea but another thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">that i noticed</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">when we were discussing this is that my</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like my brain</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just switch between an active or</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">passive mode but also between an</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">output and input mode like when</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">contemplating it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">creating an understanding of something</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">right you&#39;re building something in your</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">centered focus around a topic so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">generating something</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">whereas if you&#39;re meditating it feels</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">almost like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">opening it it&#39;s a place you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">open yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">up to almost like ideas coming to you in</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:37.040" style="s2">a sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">so it would kind of be more like how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.040" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">know dreaming would work</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">you know like daydreaming like you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">you kind of drift off maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">and i&#39;m not you know meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">brought okay this is maybe just one</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">experience of it whereas contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">is the idea of focus not not broad but</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">maybe depth</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">um so those are those are some</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">things came up oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">oh sorry all right good please yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">talking about they really thought up a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">lot for me um</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">i think yeah for the contemplation part</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">um really intriguing and i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">um you know i see a couple ways of then</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">thinking about contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">you know from what michael osgood was</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">saying was sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">just like how it&#39;s just thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">um man who&#39;s menace what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">um and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">relating it to like how i would</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">personally describe contemplation um</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">distinct from thinking um and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">like for me i would</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">for me i like to think of contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">as like when i read maybe like a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">book or something and there&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">a little sentence in there</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">where it&#39;s just like there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">feeling it&#39;s like a feeling intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.720" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">sense where i&#39;m trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit thinking but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">also kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">like what what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.640" style="s2">for me i want to add that whenever i</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">totally get that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.640" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">and whenever it happens i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the only thing i remember</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">the whole book or the chapter is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">no yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">to grasp it&#39;s not exactly like thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s reaching out for meaning like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">just being receptive to anything i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">like searching for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">yeah um i just want to say one thing</p>
