<p begin="00:02:10.160" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">and i suspect that as we get into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">wisdom of medication more philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">more general questions</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">be august 21st of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">this month okay so let&#39;s get started</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">so how we will do this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">is when when we&#39;re going through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">dharma aspects is i will do</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">uh like i said a bit of a lesson um</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">then we will sit and then we will do uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">as always we&#39;ll still do the chanting</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">still do this etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">so we&#39;re doing the western tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">the pivotal figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">for that tradition is socrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">so just as the buddha was the touchstone</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">as we were going through the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">ecology of practices tradition</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">socrates would be to touch them all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">the groups that we&#39;re going to take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">in the wisdom of hypatia the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">the epicureans and the neil platonus are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">influenced by socrates and they use</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">socrates as an exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">there&#39;s of course just like the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">just like jesus of nazareth</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">there are many different interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">of societies i&#39;m not going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">offer you a single interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the point of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">here this is not a history class</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do here is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">best interpretation of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">relative to the individual movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">that was in response to him and those</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">movements were</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.159" style="s2">what wouldn&#39;t zero on about zeroing up</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">on them is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">they generated ecologies and practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">for the cultivation of wisdom okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">socrates is a pivotal figure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">athenian philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">there if you go to episode 4 of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">there is an extended discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">socrates there</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">first we want to take a look at is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">somebody who was influenced by him which</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">who is epicurus now right away we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">to pause here because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">the term that has come into our language</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">uh describing someone who follows an</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">is epicurean the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">we it has gone through significant</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">decadence</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">so that most people when they hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">curious they hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">hedonism they hear the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">largely through self-indulgence and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">largely around</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">associated with food</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">now while epicurus has a lot to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">about pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">he is not advocating that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">decadent hedonism that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">epicurus is about at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">so i need all of us to put aside</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">the standard meaning of epicurean of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">and we need to retrieve the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">meaning because our job here is to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">to retrieve the ancient ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">okay so epicurus as i said everybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:23.039" style="s2">socrates as the touchstone and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.039" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">impressed uh epicurus about socrates</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">was socrates capacity for what</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">and this is a phrase that that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">curious is going to make famous</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">anoraxia anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">now that term is hard to translate</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">adoraxia is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">often translated as tranquility that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">what the clinton does</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s translated as equanimity</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">so this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">this in greek this is the opposite the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">negating</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">so like a theist is someone who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">believe in god</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">so this negates what this basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">means is it needs</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">turmoil or tumult and so this means</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">a lack of turmoil a lack of tumult</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">and so you know now what epicurus is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">actually on about</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">we have this phrase and it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">as rich as it needs to be but we talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">about peace of mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">that freedom from inner turmoil inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s like when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:33.840" style="s2">now epicurus is famous in fact for</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">saying call no man a philosopher who has</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.840" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">not alleviated</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">the suffering of others this was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">central concern</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:42.319" style="s2">of his philosophy it wasn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">indulgence</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.319" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">it was about the alleviation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">suffering now</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">the suffering caused by a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">anorexia the suffering caused by</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">inner turmoil inner tumors</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">let&#39;s remember that suffering primarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">a loss of agency</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">you are no longer the author of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">experience and its meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">things have overtaken you that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">often use</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">another metaphor for when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">turmoil we talk about being</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">upset we&#39;re upset because now we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">control we&#39;ve lost being centered we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">lost being balanced</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">and this is related to an important</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.599" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">disease we get our word disease from</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">this which is a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">ease which is not quite the same as</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">being easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">the things being easy so ease is more</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">a a fluency of flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">with reality all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">so epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">was really interested about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">he saw himself almost like the physician</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">the psyche he&#39;s very much the model of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">being a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">almost like a psychotherapist today</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">and so what epicurus was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">well what&#39;s the disease and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">cure</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">and now you can see how we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">getting into an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">so for epicurus the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">the reason why we are diseased the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">reason why</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">we are in inner turmoil we&#39;re upset</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">is because we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">right we&#39;re uneducated</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:44.959" style="s2">about our relationship to pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">and pain we&#39;re socialized</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.959" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">by our culture but that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">thing as what</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">epicurus is talking about what epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">is that we often are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">confused about pleasure and pain</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">so one way of putting it that is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">is epicurus wants us to bring a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">and reflective discernment to our</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">to pleasure and pain see epicurus isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">about maximizing pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">epicurus is about trying as much as</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">as much as possible to get you into</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">with pain and closure</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">so why are we confused well epicurus was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">deeply influenced by the atomic model</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">that was a model that was at the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">that all the reality was made up of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">adam&#39;s emotion</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be the basis of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">theory he was very scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">oriented</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s completely appropriate that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">use the best science of today</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">to try and supplement to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">supplement</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">that purist so what do we know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">well we know that the way we pay</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">attention to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:06.399" style="s2">our and right the way we get pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">and pain of things</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">is affected by how salient</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">something is to us how much it stands</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">out to us because when things stand up</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:16.560" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:16.560" style="s2">they arouse us</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.839" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s a basic feature that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">about how things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">arouse us so let&#39;s say this</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">is time</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">so this is the present and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">future and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">how salient something is to us</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">and all organisms show this graph this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">is called hyperbolic discounting</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">very rapidly as something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">thinking about becomes more in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">it loses its salience to us this is why</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">we procrastinate</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">because a present</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">pleasure can override</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">right so here&#39;s a pleasant pleasure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">not very important</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">but because it&#39;s in the present it gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">magnified</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">here&#39;s a very future pain</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">but because it&#39;s in the future it gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">minimized so one of the things we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">is we have to learn to widen our frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about that not today</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that later in the week</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">we can learn to widen our frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">this is a mindfulness exercise it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">a contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">because we need to do stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">counteract this</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">okay so we tend to therefore do what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">we tend to confuse intensity with</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">importance we tend to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">intensity with importance and one way</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">you can think about what epicurus is</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">trying to get us to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">is he&#39;s trying to get us to invert that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:08.079" style="s2">to train ourselves so that we find the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.079" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">most intense you see that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">powerful inversion normally we confuse</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">how intense something is with how</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">important it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">but what if you could train yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">make the importance</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">more intense that&#39;s sort of the key</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">one of the key moves that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">to achieve here</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">with epicurus okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">in the wisdom of hypatia mclennan is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">recommending</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">a couple of basic practices that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">take up right from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">right and one is self-examination so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">remember the pivotal figure socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">famously said the unexamined life is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">worth living</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">how much do we examine the processes</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:13.000" style="s2">and the patterns of our pleasures and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">pace how much</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.000" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">self-examination do we engage</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">mclennan also recommends a process that</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">i i like to call he doesn&#39;t call it this</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">i call that maximization</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">this is the collection of maxims</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">very pithy phrases that help to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">very readily bring to mind principles</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">now here&#39;s where i can explain something</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">to you why are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">maxims because max the goal of maxims</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">are to open that frame up widen the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">so that you&#39;re not locked into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">present moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">if this is a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">attitude towards the present moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">you&#39;re not locked into that hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">discounting</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;re frame widening so you can get an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">ability to discern between intensity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">importance</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">and so what the maxims do is they</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">maximize your afraid</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">they remind you important principles</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">open up your frame so i just gave you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">the unexamined life is not worth living</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">socrates was going to die for that now</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">this means that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">if we don&#39;t engage in a regular and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">reliable practice of self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">our lives lose most of their values</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">fairly strong playing very strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">so like all these maxims you have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">sort of take them with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">you don&#39;t absolutize them but there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:44.279" style="s2">important insight there</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">so we have to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.279" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">of pleasures and pains</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">okay so how do we do that okay so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">the principle</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">maybe this is a maximum for you a maxim</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:05.720" style="s2">what we&#39;re engaging in is prioritization</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">for the ease of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.720" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">prioritization for the easiest for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">ease of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">prioritization for the ease of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">so what you&#39;re gonna do is right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">when a desire comes up so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">mostly today about desire because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">about pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">and then we also are going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">fear</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">uh because that has to do with pain but</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">this is for later</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">today we&#39;re concentrating on this one</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">okay so when you have a desire</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">and of course you&#39;re gonna also you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:47.519" style="s2">have an associated sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">pleasure what you&#39;re gonna do back</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.519" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">what you&#39;re gonna do first is don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">immediately</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">look through the desire and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">going to see something that links up</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">nicely with</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">what we learned from buddhism step back</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">and look at the desire</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">don&#39;t look at the world through your</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">automatically step back and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">and then something very analogous to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">labeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">categorize your desire categorize your</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s basically four stages you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">through you ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">is is a desire natural or unnatural</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">this is the epicurean model what this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">natural means it means that you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">honestly say to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">you need it right in order to heat</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">alive but there&#39;s right three lives you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">use your physical life so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">need to remain physically alive</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">is your mental life what do you need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">keep your mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">healthy and vital and your social life</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">what you need what you because you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">an inherently social cultural being</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">what you need to keep that alive and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">so is this desire natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">you want a drink of water that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">natural desire</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">okay is it necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">so there are natural desires they</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">satisfy something</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">that has to do with our physiological</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">life our mental life or our social life</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">but they can be unnecessary so whereas i</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">need a drink</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary when i&#39;m thirsty i may</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">desire a bottle of pepsi</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">pepsi is unnecessary even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">satisfying a natural desire</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">so first of all you give priority</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">to desires that are both natural and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">over ones that are natural and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">see we&#39;re prioritizing next</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">next we consider desires that are both</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">unnatural and unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">and then what is very so what&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">example of according to epicurus of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">desire that&#39;s unnatural and unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">fame because we desire fame but this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">something i reflect a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">on given my current context what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">many people live lives without fame so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">fame is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">not natural and it&#39;s not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">now you say but i need status social</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">recognition that&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">about the pursuit of faith celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">status that&#39;s both unnatural</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">and unnecessary so</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">you step back you look at the desire</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">you categorize the desire is it natural</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">is it necessary then you ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">short term long term</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">can i satisfy this desire only short</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">or will i be able to satisfy it long</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">term and what you then</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">take a look at is you engage in that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">bring the principles in the maxims</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">they widen your frame and you say will</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">the satisfaction of this desire</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">will it will it satisfy these principles</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">so if i keep satisfying this desire will</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">it actually for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">reduce my capacity to examine myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">well then while i&#39;m getting short-term</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">pleasure i&#39;m going to be buying</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">long-term</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s how the maximization comes in</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">frame widen</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">to see oh right right</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:36.840" style="s2">now then ask yourself another question</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">is it a mental pleasure or a physical</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">and the argument of epicurus contrary to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">what popular media is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">is that mental pleasures are much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.320" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">important than physical pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">why because physical pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">are ones that are not unique to us as</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">human persons</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">mental pleasures of course are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">pleasures that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">can if properly educated lead us</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">to wisdom lead us to virtue and epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">was very concerned</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">with the cardinal virtues with wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">and justice and socialism</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">and courage especially we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">okay so is it natural</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">is it necessary short term long term</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">maximization</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">now final fourth important question to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">how easily can i obtain it</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">how easily can i clean it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">because if it&#39;s very hard to obtain</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">then i&#39;m putting myself at great at risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">of not</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">obtaining that pleasure and of falling</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">prey</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">to pain and frustration</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">now you don&#39;t start with how easy it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">to obtain you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">you don&#39;t start you&#39;ll answer all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">other questions first and then you ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.679" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">how easy is it to obtain because when i</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">answer all these questions correctly</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m getting is i&#39;m trying to teach</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">myself to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">those desires that seek the pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">that are most easily sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">what does that get me to well that gets</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">me to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:28.840" style="s2">one of the most important ways of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.840" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">adoraxia we when we hear this</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">we hear this as a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">tumult a lack of turmoil and that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">course right</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s right technically but it&#39;s wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">its connotation because</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">we should be hearing this as a positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">not as a negative term because what</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">i would argue epicurus was on about was</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">learning to to savor</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">the pleasure of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">the pure pleasure of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">being alive again the three lives</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">being physically alive mentally alive</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">and socially a lot we&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">how those all come together</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">when we talk about philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">companionships</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">friendship was the most important virtue</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">the most important practice for epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">so how do we get to the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">where we can savor</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">savor</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">that positive pleasure they get so</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">backgrounded as we</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">layer and complexify our lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s a practice and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">really important book</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">on this kind of work right</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">savoring a new model of positive</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">i want to teach you savoring and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do when we sit</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">is we&#39;ll chant we&#39;ll sit for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">a shorter meditation set and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">also talk you through</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:29.919" style="s2">the savoring practice okay this is also</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">something you should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.919" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">i recommend as if you&#39;re in a garden so</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:37.200" style="s2">mcclellan talks about right</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">uh the epicureans are in the garden um</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">he uses pork for the soda that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the colonnade</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">the colonnade right and then the grove</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">doing the the savoring practice while</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">you&#39;re walking through</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">a natural environment is really optimal</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">but i&#39;ll show you how to do it even when</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">we&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">so i want you to think of your</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">experience as having two features to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">perception this is in</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">in cognitive psychology music called</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">and what you this is how information is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">coming into you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">what you want to do for savoring is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">want to first set you want to get in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">that sense where you&#39;re opening yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">trying to become more receptive more</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">sensitive you guys know how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">already because of finding your flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">finding your root okay this word</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">is a little less familiar prehending</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">so pretending um it&#39;s like comprehending</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">grasping with your hand apprehending</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">this comes notion was from whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">this is basically your ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">right to grasp patterns to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">relations and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">considered coming top down and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">the proceeding this bottom up so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">first of all you&#39;re trying to not have</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">any sentences or scenes in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">so it might be good to do you know a few</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:16.559" style="s2">breaths of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">the past note when i&#39;m walking</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing is i&#39;m taking an attitude</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to put aside</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">all of these other complex patterns i</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">have a pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">of pursuing things and trying to come</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">a more fully engaged</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">perception of trying to open up and make</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">myself more sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">and so i&#39;m noticing more differences and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">colors and more shapes right and at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">right it&#39;s not just passive though i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">trying to do more pretending i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">to almost like a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">like you know a detective i i&#39;m trying</p>

<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">the lectio divina will also give you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">will often give you maximums</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">will generate maximums from your lexus</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">all these things are now talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">other more</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">in your ecology practices now the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">thing to do is to savor</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">while you&#39;re walking in a more natural</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">environment if possible like in a garden</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">like epicurus and also saber while</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">you&#39;re eating food</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">you drink some liquid</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">when you touch something</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously a moment of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a remembering</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.720" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a remembering of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">kind of pleasure that is the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">sustainable pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the pleasure that most allows you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">to recover your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">agency and being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:31.040" style="s2">no other pleasure does that like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">pleasure of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.040" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">being okay so we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">time for one question i&#39;ll take more</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">questions tomorrow a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">and also on wednesday we&#39;ll do a review</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">more questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">thursday like i said open this up</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">share questions from your practice from</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">the wisdom of hypatia but also comments</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">observation connections you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">all the pre-hending you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">okay so i think we have one question</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">one second jason&#39;s just making some</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">adjustments</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">ah so here&#39;s a question directly related</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">to today&#39;s practice from kira</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">how do you not bullshit yourself on what</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">so this is where i mentioned something</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">um that is crucial which is uh the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">connection to science</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">so what you have to do is i mean for</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">your body you have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">what are the things that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">necessary for your body</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">and for your mind what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">that are actually needed</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">to have a healthy sense of mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.800" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">so a couple things that are helpful is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">right you know you can we develop a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">of attention to our culture to a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">body and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">and we sometimes confuse that with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">body of a certain image so</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">i won&#39;t i won&#39;t say too much about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to hold offs talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">the social life uh because we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">to get that when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">philosophical companionship so kiera</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">i&#39;m going to concentrate on just the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">mental life</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">so this is what i propose to you and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">that this is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">directly epicurus but i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">consonant with it and i think it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">of extended epigenesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">what is the food of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">what is it we&#39;re actually generating</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing the savory</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">it is meaning not just but i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">just conceptual meaning that&#39;s primarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">not what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">meaning that is the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">what people talk about in meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">life that sense that&#39;s enhanced in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">flow state</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s enhanced in mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">that&#39;s that sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">connected to the world to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">and to each other rightly what is needed</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">in order to afford to protect produce</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">and promote</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">those connections to oneself to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">other people and to the world so such</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">that you matter that you&#39;re connected in</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">that makes a difference that i would</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">pose to you is the food of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">that is the health of the mind meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">in life so</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">what is needed for making</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">meaning and the thing is this is where</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">we get most confused</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">this is where we confuse right intensity</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">with the importance but remember what</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">importance means import</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">you actually take in what nourishes you</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">when you ask people reliably</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">at different stages of their life what</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:47.680" style="s2">makes your life</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">meaningful to you it is not the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.680" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">that are often occupying us with</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">intensity</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">because what actually makes people feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">like their lives are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">are those experiences in which they</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">savor</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">the connectedness the connectedness to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">to each other and to the world what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">needed for that that&#39;s the food that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">importance for the mind that should not</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">be confused</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">with mere intensity so like i said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">going to do much more</p>
