<p begin="00:00:10.050" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">reliably so far he&#39;s finding</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.780" end="00:00:18.840" style="s2">relationships of complementarity a tan</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.689" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">to dominate or destroy I know that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">I think for me not only what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">talking about but the exemplification of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">how we&#39;re talking and how we&#39;re entering</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">into a relationship how are we we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:39.750" style="s2">reap right or we&#39;re reprioritizing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.710" end="00:00:42.360" style="s2">moving off of the product and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.750" end="00:00:45.530" style="s2">position and trying to really move into</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:48.390" style="s2">process and participation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.530" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s always been very</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.390" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">important to me because as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">aspire towards the Socratic ideal but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:01:00.410" style="s2">that is now even more so the case for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">because I see that ability to enact</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.410" end="00:01:05.390" style="s2">functional as opposed to dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">and adaptive as opposed to maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.390" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">collective intelligence and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">into something like collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">rationality so that it can effectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">so that we can effectively aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">collective rationality and wisdom um</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:23.670" style="s2">that has become has become very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">central to me and like so that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.670" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">process of all this discussion over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">last year meeting all of you guys and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">women and then engaging in the work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:38.579" style="s2">the after Socrates project as all as</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">just it has intensified and very</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.579" end="00:01:42.270" style="s2">dramatically deep and it was already</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">deep I believe but is then intensified</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.270" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">and dramatically deepened my commitment</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">to the Socratic ideal deilogos that has</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">now become mmm sort of very very I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:54.990" style="s2">say that sacred to me and the way I talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">about in this series right okay if</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.990" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">you&#39;ve already breached on some aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">breached you&#39;ve already touched on some</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">of the things that we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">discuss the first being rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">so you said you said collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:12.050" style="s2">rationality yeah oh so that seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:12.050" style="s2">an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:16.860" style="s2">and dial logos so so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">difference between just ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.860" end="00:02:24.299" style="s2">rationality and and let&#39;s say collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:29.189" style="s2">rationality and dialogue and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.299" end="00:02:30.299" style="s2">OHS alright so let&#39;s let&#39;s well let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.189" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">it first what&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.299" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">sort of ordinary or comp the common</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">right good notion of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">there and the notion I&#39;m arguing for and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">then we&#39;ll do that sort of individually</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:42.420" style="s2">because that will give me an analogic</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">basis for them talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.420" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">collective it is that okay great yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">typically and I know this because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:54.569" style="s2">teach I teach on rationality and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:56.909" style="s2">get to see people&#39;s and these are right</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.569" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">educated young people they&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.909" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">so they&#39;re sort of the best represented</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:03.180" style="s2">representative of what we call folk</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:06.359" style="s2">psychology so within the COG SCI</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:08.250" style="s2">academic world folk psychology is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.359" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">psychological the implicit largely</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.250" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">implicit psychological theories that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">most people are carrying around so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:14.389" style="s2">people have theories implicit theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">about intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.389" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">right right right and it&#39;s folk</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:19.139" style="s2">psychology they haven&#39;t listened</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">theories about how memory works they</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.139" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">have insisted theories about what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">concepts are the now one thing we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:29.879" style="s2">put on the table right away is and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.299" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">is what I said a lot of time doing in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.879" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">introduction to cog sign is most of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">those folks psychological intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">have turned out to be wrong but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">have turned out to be very wrong and for</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">a kind of important reason right so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.859" style="s2">let&#39;s say you know our ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:49.530" style="s2">rationality or ideas about wisdom yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.859" end="00:03:52.829" style="s2">ideas about intelligence you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.530" end="00:03:57.709" style="s2">them are distorted or a very yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.829" end="00:03:59.639" style="s2">very very skewed are these about memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.709" end="00:04:01.199" style="s2">let me give you an example for</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.639" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">commemorate because it&#39;s it&#39;s far enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.199" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">away from our topic that&#39;ll be a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:07.949" style="s2">less controversial a little a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:10.019" style="s2">easier to dip sort of establish so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.949" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">people we have all these metaphors in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.019" end="00:04:13.650" style="s2">fact that to speak this we think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">memory as like like like a room in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.650" end="00:04:17.130" style="s2">we store things and we go in there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:20.219" style="s2">we retrieve it and we search through our</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.130" end="00:04:22.139" style="s2">memory and so the metaphor we have is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.219" end="00:04:23.430" style="s2">kind of like we&#39;d like a library and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.139" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">we&#39;re sending people in and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.430" end="00:04:27.380" style="s2">moving around</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:29.150" style="s2">and why and this kit brings me to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.380" end="00:04:31.220" style="s2">point I wanted to make we have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.150" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">folks psychological notions because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.220" end="00:04:34.820" style="s2">have to remember that in our folk</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:37.940" style="s2">psychological context we are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.820" end="00:04:40.610" style="s2">primarily interested in explaining</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.940" end="00:04:43.310" style="s2">phenomena we&#39;re interested in primarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.610" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">predicting and training so right</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.310" end="00:04:46.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a language of explaining in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:48.650" style="s2">language of the training okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.550" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">what I want to say if I want to train</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.650" end="00:04:53.330" style="s2">your memory it&#39;s a really good thing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">use that idea of a room right here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.330" end="00:04:57.110" style="s2">this is you see it on Sherlock right you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.370" style="s2">have your you have your memory palace or</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">your mind Palace right you have this</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.370" end="00:05:01.940" style="s2">room it&#39;s called the method of low-side</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.140" style="s2">and I say I&#39;m gonna talk to Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:06.860" style="s2">enough but first talk about rationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.140" end="00:05:08.420" style="s2">so you know III get a room or like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.860" end="00:05:10.790" style="s2">space maybe this house that I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.420" end="00:05:12.260" style="s2">Phil you familiar with it the library is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.790" end="00:05:13.970" style="s2">where I&#39;m gonna talk to Andrew but</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.260" end="00:05:15.230" style="s2">rationality so form an image of you in</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.970" end="00:05:16.670" style="s2">the library and there&#39;s books and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.230" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">there&#39;s knowledge and alright right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.670" end="00:05:19.820" style="s2">then and then I&#39;m not going to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:21.230" style="s2">you know Andrew perhaps about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:23.690" style="s2">transformation well that&#39;s the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.230" end="00:05:25.640" style="s2">on a picture Andrew in the kitchen and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.690" end="00:05:27.080" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s doing and so what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.640" end="00:05:28.460" style="s2">make all these images and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.080" end="00:05:30.110" style="s2">different places and what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.460" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">actually search I go from room to room</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.110" end="00:05:35.210" style="s2">to room in my mind there&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:37.400" style="s2">way to train memory the ancient orders</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.210" end="00:05:38.810" style="s2">could use this technique to memorise</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.400" end="00:05:41.540" style="s2">speeches that will last like six hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.810" end="00:05:43.910" style="s2">so it&#39;s really powerful way to train</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.540" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">your memory it&#39;s and it goes very well</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.910" end="00:05:47.570" style="s2">with all those metaphors the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:49.940" style="s2">our memory doesn&#39;t work like that at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.570" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">that&#39;s good language for training it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.940" end="00:05:55.220" style="s2">you you don&#39;t actually have that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:58.250" style="s2">you know search cereal search because</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.220" end="00:06:02.270" style="s2">for example can you please tell me</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">Justin Bieber&#39;s phone number mmm no no</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.270" end="00:06:06.410" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know it no you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:08.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t scroll through all of your phone</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.410" end="00:06:11.510" style="s2">numbers and realize that it wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.750" end="00:06:14.270" style="s2">you just know is that like a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.510" end="00:06:16.190" style="s2">or something or well no there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.270" end="00:06:18.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that it&#39;s there&#39;s a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.190" end="00:06:20.180" style="s2">there&#39;s also a kind of parallel search</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:22.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of memory probably in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.180" end="00:06:25.850" style="s2">neural networks as opposed to located</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:27.560" style="s2">memory like in standard computers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.850" end="00:06:28.040" style="s2">and you know and your memories aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.560" end="00:06:30.140" style="s2">stable</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.040" end="00:06:32.030" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly reconstructing them</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.140" end="00:06:34.280" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly rewriting them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.030" end="00:06:35.990" style="s2">why confident I listen it alright</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.280" end="00:06:38.120" style="s2">confident eyewitness testimony</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.990" end="00:06:38.550" style="s2">forty-nine percent of it is inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.120" end="00:06:41.069" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.550" end="00:06:42.930" style="s2">9% of it is wrong huh right because</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.069" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">confidence measures how meaningful you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.930" end="00:06:48.150" style="s2">find the experience not how accurate</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:51.080" style="s2">that it is or you know we think you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.150" end="00:06:53.099" style="s2">in a library things that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.080" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">that are relevant to each other are</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.099" end="00:06:57.509" style="s2">stored close to each other but like in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:59.370" style="s2">your memory if I give you a if I say</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.509" end="00:07:02.069" style="s2">color red say another color as quickly</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.370" end="00:07:07.229" style="s2">as you can so red red okay or say</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.069" end="00:07:10.979" style="s2">another color red blue okay now give me</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.229" end="00:07:13.590" style="s2">a word that rhymes with blue true okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.979" end="00:07:19.490" style="s2">so red is close to blue and blue as</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.590" end="00:07:22.759" style="s2">close to true is red close to true no no</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.490" end="00:07:26.699" style="s2">memory so although we talk about memory</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.759" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">I&#39;m in training with that and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.699" end="00:07:29.969" style="s2">so intuitive to us that that must be how</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:32.759" style="s2">memory works</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.969" end="00:07:34.169" style="s2">that&#39;s not how memory actually works you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.759" end="00:07:37.020" style="s2">see that I&#39;m trying to show you just in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.169" end="00:07:39.030" style="s2">these sort of Pony eat you know dog and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.020" end="00:07:41.610" style="s2">pony examples that your memory doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.030" end="00:07:44.039" style="s2">actually work that way in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.610" end="00:07:46.139" style="s2">taken us a long and and attention</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.039" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work just like the spotlight and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.139" end="00:07:50.190" style="s2">all kinds of yeah so I&#39;m jumping ahead</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.900" style="s2">to say that this is what you mean about</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.190" end="00:07:53.729" style="s2">wisdom - right is seeing for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.900" end="00:07:57.389" style="s2">deception right</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.729" end="00:07:59.880" style="s2">or are these these forms can leave their</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.389" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">lead to self-deception or they can lead</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.880" end="00:08:03.539" style="s2">to a greater understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:05.849" style="s2">depending how we use them or how</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.539" end="00:08:08.490" style="s2">transparent they are to us right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.849" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">though what I&#39;m trying to get at yes I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.490" end="00:08:13.080" style="s2">that&#39;s I think a very appropriate way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:15.330" style="s2">reframing what I&#39;m saying if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.080" end="00:08:17.370" style="s2">pay attention to the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.330" end="00:08:20.130" style="s2">our folks like a logical language of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.370" end="00:08:22.710" style="s2">training and our scientific language of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.130" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">explaining we can equivocate we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.710" end="00:08:28.050" style="s2">confuse them together and thereby deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:29.789" style="s2">deceive ourselves now I and get into all</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.050" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">kinds of New Age nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.789" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">well mu Age nonsense but also we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:40.370" style="s2">fail to more powerfully even use our</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:42.779" style="s2">memory when we&#39;re studying for a test so</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.370" end="00:08:44.250" style="s2">so people think well the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.779" end="00:08:45.660" style="s2">study for a test to sort of read the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.250" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">material over and over again and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.660" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">rehearse it because it&#39;s like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:51.209" style="s2">you know writing over and over again on</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:51.890" style="s2">the same spot in the library to make it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.209" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.890" end="00:08:55.550" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the best way to try and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">study for a test for example because</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.550" end="00:08:59.630" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually using your memory</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:02.180" style="s2">for how it actually functions oh can I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.630" end="00:09:04.010" style="s2">can I just do a slight aside here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.180" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">because this is fascinating to me I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.010" end="00:09:08.690" style="s2">talking to Zach Stein yeahi Santino&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">act you know yeah just that could I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.690" end="00:09:14.990" style="s2">talked yes yeah he&#39;s a brilliant guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">anyway he told me that his that he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.990" end="00:09:21.140" style="s2">high achieving dyslexic yes and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">described his mind and it seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.140" end="00:09:25.460" style="s2">very similar to mine and I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">that I have the same thing that he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.460" end="00:09:31.250" style="s2">oh you read the paragraph first and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.720" end="00:09:33.140" style="s2">you read the sentence and then you read</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.250" end="00:09:35.000" style="s2">the word you don&#39;t read from the word up</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.140" end="00:09:37.220" style="s2">to the paragraph like you got your two</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.000" end="00:09:40.130" style="s2">in the Gestalt and then it&#39;s sorry then</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.220" end="00:09:43.160" style="s2">you have to get to the to the junk you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.130" end="00:09:45.170" style="s2">to the feature right yeah so an ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.160" end="00:09:46.670" style="s2">mind kind of for most I shouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.170" end="00:09:48.500" style="s2">ordinary because nobody has an ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.670" end="00:09:50.840" style="s2">mind but most people kind of build up</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.500" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2">from from maybe the feature to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.840" end="00:09:54.740" style="s2">gestalt and then a person who has it</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:09:56.030" style="s2">sort of has that kind of dyslexia it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.740" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t read or anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.030" end="00:10:00.950" style="s2">they just kind of do things in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">different you know different way you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.950" end="00:10:06.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a little it&#39;s a it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:09.230" style="s2">more complicated everybody I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.350" end="00:10:10.100" style="s2">everybody actually simultaneously again</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.230" end="00:10:11.750" style="s2">because you&#39;re not doing things</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.100" end="00:10:14.390" style="s2">step-by-step the way we think in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.750" end="00:10:16.220" style="s2">language yeah here&#39;s you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.390" end="00:10:17.660" style="s2">why we had to get neural networks to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.220" end="00:10:21.280" style="s2">solve what&#39;s called the chicken and egg</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:23.660" style="s2">problem because when I&#39;m reading I to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.280" end="00:10:25.130" style="s2">read the letters in order to read the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.660" end="00:10:26.690" style="s2">word but I need to know what the word is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.130" end="00:10:28.490" style="s2">in order to disambiguate the letters</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.690" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">so you&#39;re spontaneously going from</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.490" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">feature to Gestalt and Gestalt to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.140" end="00:10:33.890" style="s2">feature sure right so it&#39;s in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">again which is not something that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.890" end="00:10:37.370" style="s2">to put into words right it&#39;s kind it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:38.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go well with sort of again a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.370" end="00:10:39.710" style="s2">folk psychological understanding of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.930" end="00:10:41.090" style="s2">we do things</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.710" end="00:10:43.460" style="s2">but it&#39;s modeled well than neural</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.090" end="00:10:45.590" style="s2">networks for example now the thing is of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.460" end="00:10:49.100" style="s2">course everybody&#39;s sort of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.590" end="00:10:50.570" style="s2">but there is variation on wit like how</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.100" end="00:10:52.900" style="s2">it&#39;s skewed some people more skewed</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.570" end="00:10:55.430" style="s2">equally some people are more skewed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.900" end="00:11:00.170" style="s2">Gestalt II if you&#39;ll allow other weird</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.430" end="00:11:01.880" style="s2">yeah so my main point of all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.170" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">thank you because you&#39;ve helped me sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.880" end="00:11:05.240" style="s2">of explicate my point right in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.680" end="00:11:09.139" style="s2">discussion we&#39;ve just had</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.240" end="00:11:12.339" style="s2">is we have to be willing to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.139" end="00:11:16.009" style="s2">our folks psychological notions</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.339" end="00:11:19.490" style="s2">rationality yeah because there&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.009" end="00:11:21.199" style="s2">it&#39;s very plausible that like all of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.490" end="00:11:24.139" style="s2">other folks psychological constructs</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.199" end="00:11:27.050" style="s2">well it has some important truths to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.139" end="00:11:29.480" style="s2">it also has a lot of misrepresentation</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.050" end="00:11:32.179" style="s2">and misdirection with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.480" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">phenomenon mm-hmm and so why that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.179" end="00:11:37.069" style="s2">little bit more challenging for us I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.839" style="s2">think is is that you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.069" end="00:11:41.990" style="s2">have sort of a memory that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.839" end="00:11:43.550" style="s2">great it&#39;s a little bit affects your</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.990" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">sort of status and your self-esteem a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.550" end="00:11:47.300" style="s2">little bit but you know I&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:50.540" style="s2">much but these terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.300" end="00:11:54.980" style="s2">intelligence rationality and wisdom they</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.540" end="00:11:57.379" style="s2">carry with them a tremendous aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.980" end="00:11:59.179" style="s2">our cognition very very powerful so</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.379" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s why people get very very sore</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.179" end="00:12:05.329" style="s2">about notions of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:08.869" style="s2">rationality and wisdom so again we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.329" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">to pull apart right our identification</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.869" end="00:12:13.999" style="s2">with these processes which of course we</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.529" style="s2">should address eventually but we need to</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.679" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">precisely uncurls I want to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.629" end="00:12:38.629" style="s2">choose standard notions of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:41.389" style="s2">be rational okay go for it okay so one</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.629" end="00:12:43.309" style="s2">notion of what rationality is you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.389" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the Spock version for the</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.470" end="00:12:51.439" style="s2">generation we know right this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:53.959" style="s2">- that rationality is illogicality and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.439" end="00:12:56.119" style="s2">you see this in you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.959" end="00:12:58.009" style="s2">of sort of online forums that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.119" end="00:13:01.990" style="s2">that&#39;s the model of rationality that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.009" end="00:13:05.420" style="s2">rationality is to be as logical as</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.990" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">possible and mr. Spock sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.420" end="00:13:13.999" style="s2">exemplified that and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:16.850" style="s2">that is it we have to we have to set it</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.999" end="00:13:17.939" style="s2">into an overarching idea that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.850" end="00:13:20.429" style="s2">we&#39;re gold</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.429" end="00:13:24.179" style="s2">achieve goals and so one thing we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.439" end="00:13:26.999" style="s2">to note is that what rationality means</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.179" end="00:13:28.229" style="s2">method as a method for us is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.999" end="00:13:30.109" style="s2">looking for the most reliable and</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.319" end="00:13:37.079" style="s2">logic is the most reliable and</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.079" end="00:13:43.019" style="s2">problem with that is it&#39;s not true not</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.989" end="00:13:44.549" style="s2">because logic isn&#39;t relative relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.019" end="00:13:46.679" style="s2">rationality but you can&#39;t identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.549" end="00:13:48.899" style="s2">rationality with logic and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.679" end="00:13:51.059" style="s2">problem logic works in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.899" end="00:13:54.119" style="s2">certainty and a completely formal system</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.059" end="00:13:55.949" style="s2">mm-hmm and what that means and I&#39;m try</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.119" end="00:13:57.599" style="s2">not to trip I try not to presuppose too</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.949" end="00:13:59.729" style="s2">much be presumptuous of what people have</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.599" end="00:14:02.689" style="s2">seen of this series but what that means</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.729" end="00:14:05.970" style="s2">is you basically into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.689" end="00:14:07.589" style="s2">processing that has to check all of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.970" end="00:14:10.109" style="s2">problems faced it has to check all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.589" end="00:14:12.209" style="s2">the information it has to check all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.109" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">possible options you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.209" end="00:14:16.859" style="s2">comprehensive and exhaustive you have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:18.419" style="s2">be kind of like a machine of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.859" end="00:14:20.279" style="s2">rather over human yeah but no machine</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.419" end="00:14:23.189" style="s2">can do that like even or even our best</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.279" end="00:14:24.749" style="s2">chess playing machines can search all</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.189" end="00:14:26.339" style="s2">the possible options it&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.749" end="00:14:28.619" style="s2">tutorial explosive they can&#39;t search all</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.339" end="00:14:30.599" style="s2">of these like that this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.619" end="00:14:32.549" style="s2">of search is it still the profound</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.599" end="00:14:35.309" style="s2">problem is that it&#39;s there&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.549" end="00:14:37.529" style="s2">much too much information too much so if</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.309" end="00:14:39.569" style="s2">you and everybody knowledge is this who</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.529" end="00:14:41.549" style="s2">was working within rationality Herbert</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.569" end="00:14:43.109" style="s2">and Simon you know I think was was it</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.549" end="00:14:44.909" style="s2">Simon&#39;s book I think it was a Newell and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.109" end="00:14:48.899" style="s2">Simon or Simon&#39;s book I think bounded</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.909" end="00:14:51.029" style="s2">rationality their rationality is always</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.899" end="00:14:54.359" style="s2">bounded in terms of what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.029" end="00:14:57.239" style="s2">possible for us Jania talked about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.359" end="00:14:58.709" style="s2">in the finitary predicament and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.239" end="00:15:01.529" style="s2">goes to the core of my work</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.709" end="00:15:03.809" style="s2">we can&#39;t reason we can&#39;t make inferences</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.529" end="00:15:05.399" style="s2">on the basis of all possible options all</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.809" end="00:15:07.409" style="s2">possible probabilities right all</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.399" end="00:15:09.269" style="s2">possible information that&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.409" end="00:15:11.309" style="s2">entirely explosive so what we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.269" end="00:15:13.259" style="s2">bound it we zero in on what&#39;s salient</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.309" end="00:15:16.019" style="s2">you knew I was going to do this then</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.259" end="00:15:20.759" style="s2">relevant then what&#39;s right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.019" end="00:15:24.269" style="s2">that means before you can even use logic</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.759" end="00:15:26.729" style="s2">you have to have pre logical processes</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.269" end="00:15:29.909" style="s2">of problem formulation the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.729" end="00:15:31.830" style="s2">attention Sergent memory and those are</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.909" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">not obstacles to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.830" end="00:15:35.970" style="s2">rational because they prevent you from</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:38.640" style="s2">being fully logical they actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.970" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">facilitate they constitute you being a</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:45.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to be sick then that</p>

<p begin="00:15:45.720" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">hit combinatorial explosion and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.160" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve committed cognitive suicide mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:53.790" style="s2">so I for dreaming or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:56.640" style="s2">you know a dream is is we don&#39;t normally</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.790" end="00:15:58.350" style="s2">think of a dream as is being rational it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.640" end="00:16:01.170" style="s2">could be but it could it could have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.350" end="00:16:03.990" style="s2">rational function or I could have yes oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.170" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">you mean well more than that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.990" end="00:16:10.110" style="s2">think that what you see is but one</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:12.780" style="s2">plausible account of what dreaming does</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.110" end="00:16:15.780" style="s2">is it&#39;s a kind of optimization process</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.780" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">on how your brain is operating mm-hm and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.780" end="00:16:19.830" style="s2">so it&#39;s not so much the content of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.940" end="00:16:22.380" style="s2">dream but it&#39;s sort of the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.830" end="00:16:25.350" style="s2">your brain is sort of practicing getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.380" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">better adjusting what it finds salient</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.350" end="00:16:29.520" style="s2">and relevant so it does weird variations</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">on patterns that you&#39;ve sort of acquired</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.520" end="00:16:33.450" style="s2">through the day and it sees which one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.460" style="s2">those sort of optimize its ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.450" end="00:16:36.660" style="s2">track and predict and solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.460" end="00:16:39.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re often solving your</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.660" end="00:16:41.310" style="s2">problems in your dreams right right here</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.420" end="00:16:44.190" style="s2">right and so and that that looks I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.310" end="00:16:46.350" style="s2">sort of create it&#39;s all illogical but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.190" end="00:16:48.210" style="s2">could turn out to be rational because it</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.350" end="00:16:50.610" style="s2">could be actually optimizing this</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.210" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">process of relevance realization it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:16:54.150" style="s2">so central especially and here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:57.000" style="s2">want to come back if it systematically</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.150" end="00:16:59.610" style="s2">and reliably improves your ability to</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.610" end="00:17:02.790" style="s2">I&#39;m going to add something to that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.810" end="00:17:04.670" style="s2">is directly implied by that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.790" end="00:17:06.570" style="s2">systematically reliable in</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">then I think that&#39;s how we should</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">practice is a practice that</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.559" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">where you need insight because when you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.020" end="00:18:32.710" style="s2">have an AHA experience you realize oh no</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.510" style="s2">I formulated the problem the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.710" end="00:18:37.179" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got to change what I find</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.510" end="00:18:39.820" style="s2">relevant and salient and that means if</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.179" end="00:18:42.130" style="s2">we have an account of rationality in</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.820" end="00:18:44.649" style="s2">which insight does not play a central</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.130" end="00:18:46.990" style="s2">role we do not have a good account of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.649" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">insight because the machinery of insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.990" end="00:18:52.659" style="s2">is the machinery by which you optimize</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">your ability to zero in an information</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.659" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same machinery you used to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.370" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">overcome self-deception mm-hmm so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.220" end="00:19:04.919" style="s2">problem with that with the with the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:07.630" style="s2">the idea of it just being intelligent is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.919" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">rationality so intelligence is what</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.630" end="00:19:11.590" style="s2">you&#39;re using well there&#39;s a lot of if I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:15.309" style="s2">could just there&#39;s a lot of very stupid</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.590" end="00:19:17.590" style="s2">intelligent people right they have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.309" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">machineries all there but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.590" end="00:19:21.820" style="s2">using it correctly or that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:25.020" style="s2">they&#39;re not using it in an optimized way</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.820" end="00:19:28.299" style="s2">or in a and let&#39;s say essica way or in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.020" end="00:19:30.520" style="s2">we&#39;re on or or an on self-delusional way</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.299" end="00:19:32.649" style="s2">right a kit right and so that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.520" end="00:19:34.659" style="s2">my point Andrew they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.649" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">your you use your intelligence to solve</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.659" end="00:19:39.850" style="s2">your problems but that can generate all</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:42.610" style="s2">kinds of skewed salience landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:44.169" style="s2">capacities for acting immorally for</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.610" end="00:19:47.320" style="s2">acting in a self deceptive manner</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.169" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">rationality is what you use in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.320" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">deal with all of that right all of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:54.730" style="s2">if you&#39;ve side effect is generated by</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">using your intelligence in an adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.730" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">manner so rationality is is is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">practice rather than something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:05.450" style="s2">just born with oh yes that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:09.019" style="s2">important to think to know that right</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.450" end="00:20:12.919" style="s2">that something and it&#39;s you said it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.019" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">aspirational right it&#39;s yes yes become a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.919" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">rational person even though it seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.740" style="s2">like an ideal like it&#39;s not a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:25.610" style="s2">likely scenario that you would become</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.740" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">100% rational yeah I don&#39;t I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.610" end="00:20:29.480" style="s2">even know if that&#39;s possible yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:31.630" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t yeah I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the correct way to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.630" end="00:20:37.519" style="s2">because it it brings with it a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:39.769" style="s2">an idea of completeness or finality and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.519" end="00:20:41.539" style="s2">because your relevance really because</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.769" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2">your intelligence is a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.539" end="00:20:46.130" style="s2">evolving dynamical system and because</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:47.779" style="s2">the world is a self-organizing dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:49.909" style="s2">system there&#39;s no there&#39;s no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.779" end="00:20:51.529" style="s2">final state you can get into where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.909" end="00:20:55.820" style="s2">can stay where you can pronounce now I</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.529" end="00:20:58.850" style="s2">am forever free from all process sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.820" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">it&#39;s all process well this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.850" end="00:21:01.820" style="s2">how I interpret the first noble truth of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:03.350" style="s2">Buddhism I&#39;m not a Buddhism but like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.820" end="00:21:08.120" style="s2">even though you know Alexander says I am</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.350" end="00:21:09.470" style="s2">but right because but I interpret it as</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.120" end="00:21:11.330" style="s2">you know not that all of life is</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.470" end="00:21:13.279" style="s2">suffering is that makes no sense but</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.330" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">that no matter where you turn there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.279" end="00:21:18.620" style="s2">no place in which you can be free from</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">the threat of self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.620" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">self-destructive behavior no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.450" end="00:21:25.010" style="s2">smart you are no matter how intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:26.360" style="s2">you are yeah you only missing something</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.010" end="00:21:29.690" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you you&#39;d always have a blind</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.360" end="00:21:32.269" style="s2">spot somewhere oh I have a lot of blind</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.690" end="00:21:33.980" style="s2">spots a lot of them so you know you take</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.269" end="00:21:35.779" style="s2">a look a lot of psychology is going</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.980" end="00:21:37.370" style="s2">through the replication crisis results</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.779" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">aren&#39;t getting replicated well you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.370" end="00:21:41.570" style="s2">what is robustly getting replicated time</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:43.820" style="s2">and time again all this stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.570" end="00:21:46.039" style="s2">cognitive bias all this stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.820" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">self-deception all this stuff about how</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.039" end="00:21:50.360" style="s2">intelligence is necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:53.389" style="s2">sufficient for rationality all of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.360" end="00:21:55.279" style="s2">is very very robust it is not going</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.389" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">through the road application crisis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.279" end="00:21:58.789" style="s2">an aspect of our cognition that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.610" style="s2">should have very strong confidence in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.789" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">which means given these two points we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.610" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">should not think of rationality as</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">identical to either logic ality or</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:10.700" style="s2">either to our intelligence of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:12.650" style="s2">our innately given</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.700" end="00:22:15.680" style="s2">problem solving capacity because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.650" end="00:22:16.760" style="s2">what I think intelligence is and and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.680" end="00:22:18.470" style="s2">and I think this would actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.760" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">ameliorate a lot of useless debates</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.470" end="00:22:23.180" style="s2">people don&#39;t like the idea you know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:24.830" style="s2">IQ is fixed because then they think</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.180" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">they&#39;re doomed right they think oh no</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.830" end="00:22:30.580" style="s2">right because you know and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:32.840" style="s2">all these objections and right and but</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.580" end="00:22:34.460" style="s2">and this is I think this is an argument</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:37.220" style="s2">I get from Stanovich we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.460" end="00:22:39.130" style="s2">caring so much about intelligence yeaji</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.220" end="00:22:41.300" style="s2">is a good predictor it&#39;s one of our best</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.130" end="00:22:42.500" style="s2">measures of general intelligence you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.300" end="00:22:44.210" style="s2">know what I should all I really care</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.500" end="00:22:46.460" style="s2">about about you how rational you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.210" end="00:22:48.830" style="s2">because that&#39;s gonna predict how moral</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.460" end="00:22:51.770" style="s2">you behave how how how you can overcome</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.830" end="00:22:53.540" style="s2">ego centrism how you&#39;re less self</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.770" end="00:22:55.580" style="s2">deceptive like an you&#39;re motruk like</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.540" end="00:22:59.060" style="s2">what about the whole effective world</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.580" end="00:23:02.390" style="s2">right I was you know I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.060" end="00:23:05.180" style="s2">about how how when I was talking to guy</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.390" end="00:23:07.580" style="s2">last night he kind of lives in that kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.180" end="00:23:11.990" style="s2">of a realm he&#39;s he&#39;s very rational as</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.580" end="00:23:14.660" style="s2">well but but he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.990" end="00:23:16.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t swim in rational arguments he he</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.660" end="00:23:19.400" style="s2">kind of swims in something else or or</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.490" end="00:23:21.530" style="s2">well but but oh but again I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.400" end="00:23:24.170" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m still I still have this narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.530" end="00:23:25.820" style="s2">definition of rationality when I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.170" end="00:23:28.040" style="s2">but that&#39;s but that&#39;s great what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.820" end="00:23:31.910" style="s2">just that&#39;s a beautiful segue for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.040" end="00:23:33.680" style="s2">because the the so I&#39;ve two ways in</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.910" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">which are the folk psychological notion</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.680" end="00:23:38.120" style="s2">is to narrow it either identify and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:39.980" style="s2">often does it both in a contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.120" end="00:23:42.500" style="s2">manner but it often identifies</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.980" end="00:23:45.320" style="s2">rationality with being intelligent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.500" end="00:23:46.730" style="s2">right and right and therefore fix like</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.320" end="00:23:48.350" style="s2">intelligence but not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.730" end="00:23:50.690" style="s2">rationality is not intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.350" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">rationality is developmental you can get</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.690" end="00:23:55.250" style="s2">better and better at matter you conspire</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:57.740" style="s2">and it&#39;s not equivalent erotic to logic</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.250" end="00:24:00.260" style="s2">ality just being good at logic is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.740" end="00:24:03.050" style="s2">it&#39;s evidence is clear it does not make</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.260" end="00:24:04.610" style="s2">you very rational actually rationality</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.050" end="00:24:06.380" style="s2">is about knowing where when it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.610" end="00:24:08.600" style="s2">rate rationing it&#39;s about knowing where</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.380" end="00:24:10.820" style="s2">when and to what degree to be logical</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.600" end="00:24:12.200" style="s2">you know this brings what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.820" end="00:24:14.600" style="s2">brings me up to the Third Way in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.200" end="00:24:16.310" style="s2">folk psychological notion ours not cross</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.600" end="00:24:20.090" style="s2">culturally but ours in the West is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.310" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">deficient is we limit rationality to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.090" end="00:24:23.900" style="s2">just inferential processes about belief</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:26.300" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.900" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">say oh we limited job could use some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.300" end="00:24:31.490" style="s2">my terminology we limit rationality to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:34.760" style="s2">just propositional knowing and that were</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.490" end="00:24:36.980" style="s2">the goal the sole goal of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.760" end="00:24:37.550" style="s2">to get true beliefs which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.980" end="00:24:40.070" style="s2">ridiculous</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.970" end="00:30:40.970" style="s2">yeah right he&#39;s folk psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.740" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">then there&#39;s a guy who&#39;s a sophist and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.970" end="00:30:46.100" style="s2">he has this sort of technical sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:47.960" style="s2">logical definition right that he&#39;s heard</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.100" end="00:30:51.290" style="s2">from somebody else right and Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.960" end="00:30:52.940" style="s2">rejects both of those and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.290" end="00:30:55.460" style="s2">you get to the end and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.940" end="00:30:57.590" style="s2">conclusion as to what courage is other</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.460" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">than the fact that these two approaches</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.590" end="00:31:02.540" style="s2">have been shown to be inadequate but</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.860" style="s2">what you see is both of the generals say</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.540" end="00:31:06.809" style="s2">they want their sons to come and learn</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.860" end="00:31:10.679" style="s2">from Socrates to spend time with</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.809" end="00:31:13.590" style="s2">Socrates because that the process well</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.679" end="00:31:15.299" style="s2">maybe because maybe perhaps courage is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.590" end="00:31:17.520" style="s2">is not something that you can define</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.299" end="00:31:19.140" style="s2">it&#39;s something that it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.140" end="00:31:23.340" style="s2">absolute sense no and maybe think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.540" end="00:31:24.660" style="s2">Heidegger and and and what he talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.340" end="00:31:28.140" style="s2">when he talked about thinking and how</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.660" end="00:31:29.910" style="s2">how you know concepts a true concept is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.140" end="00:31:32.610" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.910" end="00:31:34.530" style="s2">finitude to it it just reveals itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.610" end="00:31:37.530" style="s2">more and more over time more and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.530" end="00:31:41.130" style="s2">truth over time and and and and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.530" end="00:31:42.270" style="s2">can&#39;t ever pin pin it down or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.130" end="00:31:43.500" style="s2">what I&#39;d let goes back to what I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.270" end="00:31:45.330" style="s2">saying earlier about you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.500" end="00:31:48.690" style="s2">away from models that see completeness</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.330" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">and I mean the image thing and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.690" end="00:31:52.650" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the right well so</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">Socrates the point of the dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.650" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">you have to step back and this is my</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">Plato writes dialogues as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:32:00.690" style="s2">just straight arguments the point is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">you you can&#39;t get a definition of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.690" end="00:32:05.340" style="s2">courage but as you watch Socrates move</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">between these two positions the skill ax</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.340" end="00:32:10.620" style="s2">and Charybdis of going along you get a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:13.799" style="s2">sense of how to get on the track how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.620" end="00:32:16.020" style="s2">aspire to courage and that Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.799" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">reliably honest so you develop a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.020" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">trust in following Socrates because he</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:27.690" style="s2">has exemplified even though he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:29.190" style="s2">explicate courage hmm so the idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.690" end="00:32:30.990" style="s2">would like to bring into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.190" end="00:32:34.140" style="s2">current practices like guys circling is</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.990" end="00:32:37.350" style="s2">to not always just be participating in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.140" end="00:32:40.049" style="s2">the process but also to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.350" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">look at what we&#39;re exemplifying in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.049" end="00:32:44.520" style="s2">process so like you know and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:47.610" style="s2">you&#39;re doing all these things to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.520" end="00:32:50.070" style="s2">maintain the flow of the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.610" end="00:32:51.480" style="s2">cognition mmm-hmm and everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.070" end="00:32:53.490" style="s2">feeling that it&#39;s very meaningful but</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.480" end="00:32:55.559" style="s2">whatever you step back and say yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.490" end="00:32:57.630" style="s2">what is meaning what is meaning in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.559" end="00:32:59.309" style="s2">situation what and not just abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.630" end="00:33:01.770" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got the phenomenology as</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.309" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">active its engaged and you have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.770" end="00:33:04.890" style="s2">people there that have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:05.940" style="s2">perspectives on it and you can start</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.890" end="00:33:07.410" style="s2">doing something like the surprise</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.940" end="00:33:09.570" style="s2">dialogue well what is it to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.410" end="00:33:11.610" style="s2">meaningfully connected and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.570" end="00:33:13.710" style="s2">what you can do is check with you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.610" end="00:33:15.900" style="s2">are we still exemplifying the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.710" end="00:33:18.170" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to explicate inside exist a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.900" end="00:33:19.610" style="s2">new you try to keep the two by</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.170" end="00:33:21.800" style="s2">tightly coupled together so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.610" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">you constantly moving Chris master</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.800" end="00:33:25.640" style="s2">Pietro and I talked about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">chapter we wrote on dr. Theo logos you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.640" end="00:33:28.850" style="s2">constantly sort of you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">constant moving but in an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.850" end="00:33:33.020" style="s2">fashion between fear theory and theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">abut ween you know theorizing and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.020" end="00:33:38.540" style="s2">going back and really theory oh really</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:41.060" style="s2">loosing it out and yeah yeah yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.540" end="00:33:45.650" style="s2">extremely experienced in it in action</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.060" end="00:33:49.700" style="s2">mm-hmm and so rationality again is would</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.650" end="00:33:53.090" style="s2">be for collective intelligence would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.700" end="00:34:00.350" style="s2">to try and find systematic and reliable</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.090" end="00:34:02.390" style="s2">ways of getting that kind of pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.350" end="00:34:05.630" style="s2">communication and connection between</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.390" end="00:34:07.220" style="s2">people in place hmm very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.630" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">interesting yet it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.220" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s very important now especially</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:17.120" style="s2">because we&#39;re in a very anti rational</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:22.220" style="s2">time or cyclic everything is about</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.120" end="00:34:24.140" style="s2">sensation and feeling and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.220" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">to be a you know say that feeling is bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.140" end="00:34:30.860" style="s2">but but everything is about everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:33.230" style="s2">is based on you know clicks and like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.860" end="00:34:34.490" style="s2">civilians experience and salience yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.230" end="00:34:37.490" style="s2">right yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.490" end="00:34:40.640" style="s2">yeah so that seems to be very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.490" end="00:34:42.230" style="s2">- yeah okay that you know there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.640" end="00:34:44.540" style="s2">ocean of experience and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.230" end="00:34:46.970" style="s2">also stepping out and coming back in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.540" end="00:34:48.830" style="s2">going in and out of that mmm I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.970" end="00:34:50.210" style="s2">it&#39;s very needed and I would want to I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.830" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to say that let&#39;s use the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.210" end="00:34:56.780" style="s2">Socratic model we just had and also some</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:35:01.220" style="s2">of the points we&#39;ve made I think our our</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.780" end="00:35:02.690" style="s2">time is irrational or lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.220" end="00:35:04.280" style="s2">rationality in two senses and once they</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.690" end="00:35:06.200" style="s2">don&#39;t like it general the one general</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.280" end="00:35:07.610" style="s2">who just let&#39;s go with my intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.200" end="00:35:10.190" style="s2">my impulse and whatever just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.610" end="00:35:12.140" style="s2">comes to me and then we have no no let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.190" end="00:35:14.780" style="s2">be rational let&#39;s be tell you exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.140" end="00:35:17.300" style="s2">what I was gonna say as well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.780" end="00:35:19.970" style="s2">it&#39;s this this hyper rationality which</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.300" end="00:35:21.140" style="s2">is is I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rationality at</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.970" end="00:35:24.500" style="s2">all which you would say is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.140" end="00:35:26.440" style="s2">rationality don&#39;t right yeah I still</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.500" end="00:35:28.700" style="s2">have this deaf I still have the folk</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.440" end="00:35:29.930" style="s2">definition of rationality in my head so</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.700" end="00:35:31.300" style="s2">it&#39;s almost hard for me to have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.930" end="00:35:34.540" style="s2">conversation until I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.300" end="00:35:38.440" style="s2">redefine the term rationality I complete</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.540" end="00:35:40.420" style="s2">myself and like I said you&#39;re struggling</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.440" end="00:35:42.670" style="s2">against not only just sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.420" end="00:35:44.380" style="s2">familiarity of your folks psychological</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.670" end="00:35:46.630" style="s2">conception you&#39;re also struggling</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.380" end="00:35:48.010" style="s2">against the fact that we have set up all</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.630" end="00:35:50.290" style="s2">these cultural patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.010" end="00:35:52.420" style="s2">identification and evaluation around</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.290" end="00:35:57.690" style="s2">these terms right and we reward people</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.420" end="00:36:00.670" style="s2">and we claim this and we claim that and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.690" end="00:36:02.980" style="s2">that&#39;s also I think acting as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.670" end="00:36:05.560" style="s2">obstacle to trying to get back to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.980" end="00:36:08.200" style="s2">notion of rationality that actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.560" end="00:36:10.390" style="s2">starts to overlap with wisdom you see</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.200" end="00:36:12.490" style="s2">that&#39;s what they these two needs do this</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.390" end="00:36:14.580" style="s2">notion of rationality is just being sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.490" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">of you know practical you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.580" end="00:36:18.760" style="s2">intelligence problem-solving or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:21.580" style="s2">notion of rationality is just being sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.760" end="00:36:23.530" style="s2">of good logic allottee it tells me</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.580" end="00:36:25.930" style="s2">nothing about wisdom basically it</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.530" end="00:36:28.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really help me it doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.930" end="00:36:30.220" style="s2">me with that systematic and reliable way</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.120" end="00:36:31.960" style="s2">of cutting through yeah heading</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.220" end="00:36:35.620" style="s2">to what&#39;s relevant and then also</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.620" end="00:36:41.940" style="s2">my development is constantly evolving</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">to you in McGilchrist recently oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.170" end="00:36:55.270" style="s2">so I I you know I&#39;m very interested</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:56.770" style="s2">because you know your story is almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.270" end="00:36:59.830" style="s2">the opposite of his but you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.770" end="00:37:01.420" style="s2">saying the same thing you know he talks</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.830" end="00:37:02.830" style="s2">about it he talked about left-brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.420" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">right-brain you talk about opponent</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.830" end="00:37:06.940" style="s2">processing their lunch working together</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:09.310" style="s2">those seem to be kind of analogous</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.940" end="00:37:10.840" style="s2">whereas he says that rationality is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.310" end="00:37:13.030" style="s2">cutting the worlds up into bits and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.840" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">turning us into bureaucratic monsters</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.030" end="00:37:21.960" style="s2">and and we need to get more into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:25.540" style="s2">right brain world of you know so a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.960" end="00:37:28.180" style="s2">feeling and and and you know or context</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.540" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">and and the right of the experience the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.180" end="00:37:33.700" style="s2">embodied experience of life you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:36.430" style="s2">so how did you how did your conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.700" end="00:37:38.290" style="s2">go how did you you we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.430" end="00:37:40.810" style="s2">again it went so well we really clicked</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.290" end="00:37:43.270" style="s2">really deeply so you know rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.810" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">they recorded it it will be released at</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.270" end="00:37:47.340" style="s2">some point</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:49.060" style="s2">so a couple points on that first of all</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.340" end="00:37:52.090" style="s2">because this goes to what we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.060" end="00:37:53.820" style="s2">talking about earlier perhaps a more</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.090" end="00:37:56.650" style="s2">helpful way to think of right and left</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.820" end="00:37:58.300" style="s2">is to think and and I actually brought</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.650" end="00:37:59.830" style="s2">this up with the in in person and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.300" end="00:38:01.450" style="s2">said it was completely convergent with</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.830" end="00:38:03.790" style="s2">him so I have good reason to believe I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.450" end="00:38:05.940" style="s2">can speak sort of uh something that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.790" end="00:38:10.450" style="s2">are agreeing on because when I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.940" end="00:38:12.730" style="s2">in-person evidence right to say so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.450" end="00:38:14.890" style="s2">can because I came at it I hadn&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.730" end="00:38:17.470" style="s2">Ian&#39;s work until about two weeks before</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.890" end="00:38:19.330" style="s2">I met was gonna meet it oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.470" end="00:38:20.680" style="s2">cuz I came at this stuff and I came to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.330" end="00:38:23.290" style="s2">similar conclusions from all the work I</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.680" end="00:38:26.680" style="s2">do on insight right inside problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.290" end="00:38:29.410" style="s2">solving so a good way to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.680" end="00:38:32.020" style="s2">right hemisphere is its it way it works</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.410" end="00:38:35.130" style="s2">more in terms of the gestalt yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.020" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">yeah and and so it likes wide open</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.130" end="00:38:40.870" style="s2">attention and it looks for for like for</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:43.000" style="s2">for it&#39;s sort of pursuing pattern</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.870" end="00:38:46.930" style="s2">completion right right</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.000" end="00:38:49.180" style="s2">whereas the the left hemisphere is more</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.930" end="00:38:51.460" style="s2">feature aliy oriented and it does things</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.180" end="00:38:52.930" style="s2">in a step by step matter it&#39;s doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.460" end="00:38:54.970" style="s2">doing something more like a pro running</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.930" end="00:38:57.340" style="s2">a program than trying to complete a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.970" end="00:39:00.130" style="s2">pattern it&#39;s sort of building features</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.340" end="00:39:01.270" style="s2">up step by step by step right and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.130" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">think about the kind of a tenth</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.270" end="00:39:06.430" style="s2">attention it needs it needs very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:09.250" style="s2">focused it looks for clarity you&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.430" end="00:39:12.220" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t like ambiguity now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.250" end="00:39:15.340" style="s2">idea of rationality when you live in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.220" end="00:39:17.380" style="s2">left brain but not that next eat and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.340" end="00:39:19.300" style="s2">that and that&#39;s I think part of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.380" end="00:39:21.970" style="s2">Cartesian heritage that&#39;s to identify</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.300" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">rationality with analysis and Mary Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.970" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">has brought this point up and I think to</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">you identify rationality with analysis</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:31.090" style="s2">is a mistake I think it&#39;s it well for</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">all the reasons I&#39;ve already articulated</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.090" end="00:39:36.220" style="s2">it truncates what rationality should</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:38.200" style="s2">mean especially because rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.220" end="00:39:40.600" style="s2">vote ratio finding the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.200" end="00:39:42.190" style="s2">rationing right getting the getting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.600" end="00:39:45.160" style="s2">proper context it&#39;s a it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.190" end="00:39:47.830" style="s2">logistical notion so why do we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.160" end="00:39:50.170" style="s2">these two well</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.830" end="00:39:52.900" style="s2">the left hemisphere is very good for</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.170" end="00:39:54.670" style="s2">well-defined problems problems in which</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.900" end="00:39:57.460" style="s2">you have a really good representation of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.670" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">your initial state your goal state what</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.460" end="00:40:00.610" style="s2">then what actions and obviously I</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:01.870" style="s2">already know it tells you and already</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.610" end="00:40:03.880" style="s2">know about what you already know</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.870" end="00:40:06.310" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s familiar to you in a deep way</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.880" end="00:40:09.460" style="s2">so a multiplication problem would be for</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.310" end="00:40:11.590" style="s2">many people a very well defined familiar</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.460" end="00:40:14.950" style="s2">problem now compare that to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.590" end="00:40:16.450" style="s2">of avoiding predation yeah what does</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.950" end="00:40:19.000" style="s2">that look like well I&#39;m avoiding you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.450" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">know well you know what&#39;s my initial</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.000" end="00:40:24.580" style="s2">state I&#39;m not sure right right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:26.980" style="s2">get a notepad and start you know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.580" end="00:40:30.100" style="s2">the goal state looks like right very</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.980" end="00:40:32.200" style="s2">clearly and this is the thing and do</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.100" end="00:40:34.330" style="s2">most of our real-world problems this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.200" end="00:40:37.840" style="s2">why that that notion of rationality of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.330" end="00:40:40.870" style="s2">analysis is so limiting most of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.840" end="00:40:43.180" style="s2">real-world problems are actually like</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.870" end="00:40:44.830" style="s2">the problem of predation they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.180" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">ill-defined problems you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.830" end="00:40:47.140" style="s2">trying to have a good conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:49.150" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.140" end="00:40:50.350" style="s2">mm-hm what&#39;s the initial condition well</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.150" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking that&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.350" end="00:40:54.220" style="s2">helpful what&#39;s the what&#39;s the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.990" style="s2">what&#39;s the goal state look like well I</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.220" end="00:40:58.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know the art does every good</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.990" end="00:41:00.970" style="s2">conversation look the same no they have</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.300" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">some feature what should I say what</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.970" end="00:41:04.690" style="s2">should i do should i rave my hand show</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">you raise my voice should I like watch</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.690" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">it like right you see what I mean or go</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">on a successful first date or tell a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:13.390" style="s2">joke you can&#39;t draw a picture to tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.150" style="s2">somebody this is how you go on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.390" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">successful first date you can&#39;t go for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.150" end="00:41:20.770" style="s2">to be yeah can&#39;t give a program program</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.350" style="s2">Yeah right but you can&#39;t that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.770" end="00:41:25.660" style="s2">mean it&#39;s useless there are way we get</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.350" end="00:41:27.610" style="s2">better at going on dates we get better</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.660" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">at conversation and think about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.610" end="00:41:31.210" style="s2">think about that what I just said how</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:34.060" style="s2">that goes back to what Socrates is doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.210" end="00:41:36.280" style="s2">in the dialogues right you get better at</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.060" end="00:41:38.260" style="s2">becoming courageous right but that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.280" end="00:41:41.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I can give you a formula or</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.260" end="00:41:44.200" style="s2">a program for an orange Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.500" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">now when I when I was talking to eat</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:47.740" style="s2">with like said we we earlier so Ian</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:49.750" style="s2">makes a distinction it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.740" end="00:41:52.510" style="s2">reverse of the distinction I make so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.750" end="00:41:53.550" style="s2">I think it was it was largely somatic he</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.510" end="00:41:56.440" style="s2">actually makes a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.550" end="00:41:58.450" style="s2">rationality and reason Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.440" end="00:42:00.190" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s what I wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.450" end="00:42:01.510" style="s2">yeah and I picked up on this reason is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.190" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2">great because reason is full</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.510" end="00:42:06.670" style="s2">and now you you put everything together</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:08.859" style="s2">and we should be reasonable but but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.670" end="00:42:11.260" style="s2">we&#39;re over emphasizing rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.859" end="00:42:14.140" style="s2">cutting bits here&#39;s what I could say</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.260" end="00:42:16.990" style="s2">then very clearly I&#39;m using rationality</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.140" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">the way en uses reason exactly using</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.990" end="00:42:26.380" style="s2">reason the way I use rationality right</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:29.530" style="s2">so what he rejects is what I consider to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.380" end="00:42:31.540" style="s2">be that truncated folks like a logical</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.530" end="00:42:34.270" style="s2">notion of rationality that I think does</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.540" end="00:42:37.180" style="s2">not represent anything that will help</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.270" end="00:42:40.600" style="s2">facilitate our aspiration towards wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:42.490" style="s2">hmm hmm so although there is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.600" end="00:42:45.130" style="s2">maybe the problem I&#39;m seeing is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.490" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">that that notion of rationality is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.130" end="00:42:51.070" style="s2">deep it&#39;s like it&#39;s Cartesian it&#39;s woven</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:52.900" style="s2">into its woven into the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.070" end="00:42:55.330" style="s2">worldview it&#39;s woven into our</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.900" end="00:42:56.350" style="s2">epistemological models and those that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.330" end="00:42:58.119" style="s2">worldview and those epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.350" end="00:43:00.310" style="s2">models get woven into our psychological</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.119" end="00:43:03.190" style="s2">models they&#39;re woven into Freud they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.310" end="00:43:05.980" style="s2">woven into young they&#39;re woven into many</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.190" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s why you that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.980" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">you that&#39;s why guy is so attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:13.390" style="s2">Heidegger because Heidegger is like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:16.090" style="s2">profoundly trying to break out of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.390" end="00:43:19.210" style="s2">whole Cartesian way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.090" end="00:43:22.869" style="s2">belief and truth and rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.210" end="00:43:25.300" style="s2">he&#39;s trying I think to get us back to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.869" end="00:43:27.940" style="s2">way of understanding rationality kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.300" end="00:43:30.730" style="s2">so maybe what he calls thinking this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.940" end="00:43:32.290" style="s2">called rationality totally Tobin</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.730" end="00:43:35.080" style="s2">Heidegger calls thinking and what he</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.290" end="00:43:37.030" style="s2">McGilchrist calls reason yes yes just</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.080" end="00:43:41.109" style="s2">sending different semantic areas here or</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.030" end="00:43:42.850" style="s2">yes I agree agree so the the argument</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.109" end="00:43:44.980" style="s2">that I have sort of why I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.850" end="00:43:47.830" style="s2">rationality is actually an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.980" end="00:43:49.930" style="s2">word is reason tends to be associated</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.830" end="00:43:51.550" style="s2">with reasoning that&#39;s wrong with reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.930" end="00:43:53.770" style="s2">it&#39;s equivocal it can go to reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.550" end="00:43:55.540" style="s2">which means inference and argument go to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.770" end="00:43:57.340" style="s2">reasonable which means this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.540" end="00:43:58.810" style="s2">thing we&#39;re talking about so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.340" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.810" end="00:44:03.880" style="s2">etymological origin of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:06.130" style="s2">Rati oh it&#39;s finding proportion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.880" end="00:44:08.140" style="s2">it&#39;s putting things into proper relation</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.130" end="00:44:11.260" style="s2">it&#39;s getting the proper perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.140" end="00:44:13.270" style="s2">a relationship yeah exactly it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.260" end="00:44:15.310" style="s2">about pattern completion then</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.270" end="00:44:17.410" style="s2">then running a program to completion</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.310" end="00:44:21.390" style="s2">those are two very very different things</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.410" end="00:44:24.130" style="s2">also we need to be unreasonable at times</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.390" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">look II mean by that because I well we</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.130" end="00:44:28.750" style="s2">need to as you say break frame right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:30.520" style="s2">for I&#39;m trying to be reasonable all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.750" end="00:44:32.650" style="s2">time if you know this is why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.520" end="00:44:36.370" style="s2">shaman is there the you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.650" end="00:44:38.770" style="s2">shamans and you know - as you talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.370" end="00:44:43.930" style="s2">about in your series yeah break out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.770" end="00:44:45.700" style="s2">the yeah nine dot problem or yep so but</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.930" end="00:44:48.820" style="s2">this brings me to this brings me to an</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.700" end="00:44:50.620" style="s2">important point I would want to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.820" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">because I actually I actually have</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.620" end="00:44:54.760" style="s2">brought this argument up I presented at</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:58.150" style="s2">a conference at a couple conferences</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.760" end="00:45:00.430" style="s2">this idea that disruptive strategies are</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.150" end="00:45:03.370" style="s2">actually important for optimization</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.430" end="00:45:05.800" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s systematically and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.370" end="00:45:07.000" style="s2">reliably important for optimization so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.800" end="00:45:08.740" style="s2">if you&#39;re running a neural network for</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.000" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">example you just let it just sort of run</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.740" end="00:45:13.840" style="s2">right it&#39;ll over fit to the data it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:15.790" style="s2">it&#39;ll find patterns in its sample and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.840" end="00:45:17.080" style="s2">really pick up on those patterns in its</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.790" end="00:45:19.240" style="s2">sample that don&#39;t actually generalize</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.080" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">generalize to the population you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.240" end="00:45:23.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a sampling bias right and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:25.510" style="s2">because the machines are so powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.350" end="00:45:27.070" style="s2">your brain is way more powerful than any</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.510" end="00:45:30.250" style="s2">neural network so think about how you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.070" end="00:45:34.210" style="s2">can really zero in right and get bound</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.250" end="00:45:36.790" style="s2">to you can over fit to your particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.210" end="00:45:37.990" style="s2">sampling of data so what do you do in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.790" end="00:45:39.610" style="s2">the neural networks well you you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.990" end="00:45:42.250" style="s2">actually disrupt the network you shut</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.610" end="00:45:44.110" style="s2">off some you shut off half the nodes or</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.250" end="00:45:44.620" style="s2">you throw noise or static into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.110" end="00:45:46.030" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.620" end="00:45:49.330" style="s2">and what that does is it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.030" end="00:45:51.010" style="s2">neural network we self organize right</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.330" end="00:45:53.470" style="s2">and that we&#39;ve stuff organization</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.010" end="00:45:55.120" style="s2">actually allows it to now generalize in</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.470" end="00:45:58.500" style="s2">ways it couldn&#39;t generalize before yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.120" end="00:46:01.810" style="s2">so you have to throw disruption in I</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.500" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">recently did some graph breathing</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.810" end="00:46:07.900" style="s2">technique he&#39;s like that and I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:10.270" style="s2">do psychedelics but but but that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.900" end="00:46:13.120" style="s2">experience just it throws you into these</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.270" end="00:46:15.580" style="s2">wild sort of spaces right right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.120" end="00:46:17.380" style="s2">wild and that and then you come out at</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.580" end="00:46:19.960" style="s2">the other side is if you&#39;ve gone into</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.380" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">Alice in Wonderland and you come out the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.960" end="00:46:26.050" style="s2">other side sort of like and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.770" style="s2">reassemble your ordinary existence and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.050" end="00:46:28.990" style="s2">hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.770" end="00:46:32.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some insight after doing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.990" end="00:46:35.500" style="s2">yeah and what what happens is your</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.910" end="00:46:39.220" style="s2">perspectival and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.500" end="00:46:42.460" style="s2">have been shifted and so a new course of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.220" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">development is actually available to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.460" end="00:46:47.110" style="s2">yeah think about think about like when</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:49.300" style="s2">you&#39;re in that when you&#39;re in that space</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.110" end="00:46:51.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like what happens in dreams a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.300" end="00:46:53.340" style="s2">of variations are being thrown out like</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.130" end="00:46:56.530" style="s2">sort of generated</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.340" end="00:46:58.090" style="s2">options are being created that open up</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.530" end="00:47:00.310" style="s2">what&#39;s called the state space it opens</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.090" end="00:47:03.250" style="s2">up the possibilities that that your</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.310" end="00:47:04.660" style="s2">brain can actually get itself into like</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.250" end="00:47:06.370" style="s2">your brain is a machine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.660" end="00:47:08.830" style="s2">constantly making itself into a new kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.370" end="00:47:10.360" style="s2">of machine and you want to periodically</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.830" end="00:47:13.660" style="s2">like with a neural network you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.360" end="00:47:15.580" style="s2">open up the options it can consider not</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.660" end="00:47:17.830" style="s2">only the options in the world it can</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.580" end="00:47:19.990" style="s2">consider but the options for what kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.830" end="00:47:24.550" style="s2">of machine it can be it&#39;s those two</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.990" end="00:47:26.230" style="s2">together at the same time and so if it</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.550" end="00:47:27.670" style="s2">and you can see this even an insight</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.230" end="00:47:29.740" style="s2">problem-solving if I give you an insight</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.670" end="00:47:31.600" style="s2">negate and I moderately distract you or</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.740" end="00:47:33.340" style="s2">even throw some static into the picture</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.600" end="00:47:36.310" style="s2">some noise that will actually help to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.340" end="00:47:38.200" style="s2">trigger your insight of course yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.310" end="00:47:41.890" style="s2">so get better at the game right if</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.200" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">you&#39;re tripped up but yeah but do it the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.890" end="00:47:46.480" style="s2">right way they 2000&#39;s right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:48.250" style="s2">an X there&#39;s a kind of expertise or you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:49.570" style="s2">have to do it in the right way right</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.250" end="00:47:51.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no formula but you have to do in</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.570" end="00:47:53.950" style="s2">the right way but there are systemic and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.160" end="00:47:55.360" style="s2">reliable ways of getting better at doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.950" end="00:47:57.550" style="s2">that disruption</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.360" end="00:48:00.700" style="s2">now here&#39;s my argument this disruption</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.550" end="00:48:02.890" style="s2">is really indispensable to optimization</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.700" end="00:48:06.790" style="s2">there are systematic and reliable ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.890" end="00:48:10.120" style="s2">of doing that wouldn&#39;t that therefore be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.790" end="00:48:12.190" style="s2">integral to our account of wisdom that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.120" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">these disruptive processes and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.190" end="00:48:15.880" style="s2">means that although they&#39;re non</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:17.620" style="s2">inferential they have actually no</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.880" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">propositional content whatsoever because</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.620" end="00:48:20.560" style="s2">they&#39;re basically oh yeah zero</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:23.500" style="s2">propositional content right but</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.560" end="00:48:27.100" style="s2">nevertheless they move you towards a</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.500" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">more optimal that optimization of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.100" end="00:48:32.080" style="s2">know I have more options in what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:33.550" style="s2">cognitive being I can be yeah and where</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.080" end="00:48:35.500" style="s2">are more options about what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.550" end="00:48:37.840" style="s2">world I can dwell within and that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.500" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">making you more rational yeah and well</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.840" end="00:48:42.619" style="s2">if yeah again it&#39;s counter into it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:44.779" style="s2">yeah well I guess the rational world</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.619" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">that we live in often feels like a kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.779" end="00:48:50.359" style="s2">of prison right yes we&#39;re trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:52.220" style="s2">caught conceptual models of things and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.359" end="00:48:54.140" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons why you would</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.220" end="00:48:57.859" style="s2">you know you would you would want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.140" end="00:49:01.670" style="s2">break frame or you do fasting or you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.859" end="00:49:04.910" style="s2">know or going into nature and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.670" end="00:49:07.670" style="s2">have all kinds of let&#39;s say of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.910" end="00:49:09.500" style="s2">kind of experiences well this brings me</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.670" end="00:49:12.109" style="s2">to another point and and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.500" end="00:49:14.359" style="s2">think Ian&#39;s bang on about the left and</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.109" end="00:49:16.730" style="s2">right stuff but there&#39;s another there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.359" end="00:49:18.680" style="s2">another opponent process that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.730" end="00:49:20.359" style="s2">bring into the discussion here which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.680" end="00:49:22.369" style="s2">the relationship like because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.359" end="00:49:26.180" style="s2">constantly toggling between being task</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.369" end="00:49:29.180" style="s2">centered and mind wandering right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.180" end="00:49:30.829" style="s2">the and the point of mind wandering I</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.180" end="00:49:32.599" style="s2">would argue at least one of its funny</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.829" end="00:49:34.700" style="s2">wondering oh yeah it&#39;s to break frame</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.599" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">it&#39;s - its - its to bring in some mild</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:39.140" style="s2">distraction take you into a weird so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:41.329" style="s2">that&#39;s key again our guy sorry I keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.140" end="00:49:44.059" style="s2">saying he because I&#39;m in France but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.329" end="00:49:47.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s what guy does well</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.059" end="00:49:49.039" style="s2">see I did it was about wandering so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.000" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to do is you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.039" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">what Heidegger is doing is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">just stay on the path that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:55.910" style="s2">machine that&#39;s gonna over fit right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:58.069" style="s2">what you need to do is you need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.910" end="00:50:00.890" style="s2">wander a bit right you need to go off</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.069" end="00:50:02.539" style="s2">almost like in mind-wandering and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.890" end="00:50:04.220" style="s2">that does is allow you to you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.539" end="00:50:06.559" style="s2">introduce the noise introduce some</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.220" end="00:50:08.599" style="s2">variation break some frame so that so</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.559" end="00:50:10.309" style="s2">but you keep moving forward but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.599" end="00:50:12.769" style="s2">now actually improving your</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.309" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">connectedness to the world rather than</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.769" end="00:50:18.500" style="s2">just getting to your destination on your</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:22.609" style="s2">part yeah and now that also speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.500" end="00:50:24.740" style="s2">the pathology of modernity right is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.609" end="00:50:27.529" style="s2">we don&#39;t maybe we don&#39;t wander enough we</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.740" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t want enough han says we</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.529" end="00:50:33.619" style="s2">don&#39;t we fill up the space too much with</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:41.450" style="s2">with with you know information yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.619" end="00:50:42.920" style="s2">and salience and and we that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.450" end="00:50:44.359" style="s2">also pointed out Hans notion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.920" end="00:50:50.590" style="s2">lingering it&#39;s not only that we fill up</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.359" end="00:50:52.780" style="s2">this space we right we</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.590" end="00:50:54.820" style="s2">well take Heidegger being at a time that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.780" end="00:50:56.860" style="s2">your being isn&#39;t inherently temporal</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.820" end="00:50:58.840" style="s2">right and so you are wait you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.860" end="00:51:01.570" style="s2">respectable and participatory knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.840" end="00:51:03.850" style="s2">time because you don&#39;t know time in any</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.570" end="00:51:05.230" style="s2">other way right the Augustine famously</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.850" end="00:51:06.790" style="s2">said this I know what time is until</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.230" end="00:51:09.340" style="s2">somebody asks me what it is because</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.790" end="00:51:11.740" style="s2">right you only know time by being in</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.340" end="00:51:13.990" style="s2">time right by being a temporal thing but</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.740" end="00:51:16.390" style="s2">so your existential mode with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.990" end="00:51:17.770" style="s2">time how you&#39;re experiencing that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.390" end="00:51:19.810" style="s2">wrong word that&#39;s the only word I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.770" end="00:51:21.220" style="s2">how you&#39;re participating maybe let me</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.810" end="00:51:24.670" style="s2">use that word how you&#39;re participating</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.220" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">in time existentially has a huge impact</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.670" end="00:51:30.520" style="s2">on the kind of being you can be and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:33.310" style="s2">hans point is we are moving into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.520" end="00:51:35.740" style="s2">culture in which we can&#39;t leader we</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.310" end="00:51:38.500" style="s2">can&#39;t we can&#39;t we can&#39;t flow with things</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.740" end="00:51:43.530" style="s2">wait everything is atomized we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.500" end="00:51:47.830" style="s2">down slike minutes and seconds is his</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.530" end="00:51:49.480" style="s2">cut up that&#39;s exactly the idea - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.830" end="00:51:52.030" style="s2">mm-hmm and so you don&#39;t get any flow you</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.480" end="00:51:57.070" style="s2">get you get the you get sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.030" end="00:51:59.470" style="s2">salient second right you know um so a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.070" end="00:52:01.530" style="s2">lot of people have met talked to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.470" end="00:52:03.610" style="s2">about this and you know we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.530" end="00:52:05.830" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing this consistent trend</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.610" end="00:52:08.140" style="s2">towards the death of melody in popular</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.830" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">music that we&#39;re losing melodic</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.140" end="00:52:13.420" style="s2">complexity and there&#39;s this compressed</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:15.490" style="s2">sound all the time with mp3 it&#39;s extreme</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.420" end="00:52:17.850" style="s2">compression of sound and supremes</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.490" end="00:52:22.600" style="s2">compression of sound and salience in</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.850" end="00:52:25.390" style="s2">salience and intensity are taking up the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.600" end="00:52:27.880" style="s2">place of right complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.390" end="00:52:29.530" style="s2">development you don&#39;t have to follow a</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.880" end="00:52:31.240" style="s2">long piece of music and go through all</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.530" end="00:52:33.160" style="s2">kinds of transformation you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.240" end="00:52:36.100" style="s2">instantly without effort get sort of hit</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:39.310" style="s2">by the same product right yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.100" end="00:52:42.700" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.310" end="00:52:45.100" style="s2">means for us is yeah that like I said</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.700" end="00:52:48.790" style="s2">it&#39;s also that we can&#39;t linger we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.100" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">stay with things in a way that affords</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.790" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">us remembering the projects of</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:54.670" style="s2">aspiration yeah I think I&#39;ve liked going</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">to the galleries like I live near in</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.670" end="00:53:00.550" style="s2">Paris and there&#39;s all these galleries</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.480" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">and how many people look at a painting</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.550" end="00:53:03.790" style="s2">you know how many people go into and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:05.410" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.790" end="00:53:07.120" style="s2">just stay with the painting and look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.410" end="00:53:09.430" style="s2">the painting and and find out a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.120" end="00:53:11.260" style="s2">experience right yes most people would</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.430" end="00:53:13.710" style="s2">would would would sort of you know look</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.260" end="00:53:15.820" style="s2">at the painting and like take a picture</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.710" end="00:53:17.020" style="s2">snapshot of it with their iPhone and say</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.820" end="00:53:20.650" style="s2">I&#39;d been there and I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.020" end="00:53:22.270" style="s2">painting what but but that that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.650" end="00:53:24.790" style="s2">just what I said the point is to collect</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.270" end="00:53:27.400" style="s2">atoms to collect moments that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.790" end="00:53:29.230" style="s2">atomized and are removed from a flow of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.400" end="00:53:32.110" style="s2">development they&#39;re just snapshots yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.230" end="00:53:33.970" style="s2">I think I think their remedy to that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.110" end="00:53:36.220" style="s2">of the remedies I&#39;ve seen is probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.970" end="00:53:39.100" style="s2">meditation in some sense because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.220" end="00:53:41.560" style="s2">for for our modern times you know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.100" end="00:53:43.120" style="s2">think because it&#39;s how else can you how</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.560" end="00:53:44.680" style="s2">else can you because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.120" end="00:53:48.100" style="s2">stimulus all the time how else can you</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.680" end="00:53:50.140" style="s2">take a break from that and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.100" end="00:53:53.050" style="s2">think I think I think both meditation</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.140" end="00:53:55.110" style="s2">and contemplation are needed sure did</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.050" end="00:53:58.300" style="s2">you have to break frame and make frame I</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.110" end="00:54:02.290" style="s2">think being able to enter into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.300" end="00:54:04.030" style="s2">Ilocos to enter into a conversation oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.290" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing for me like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.030" end="00:54:09.220" style="s2">like I&#39;ve been meditating for years but</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:11.080" style="s2">but you and Guyon that&#39;s a--that&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.220" end="00:54:13.980" style="s2">kind of possibility for me right I</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.080" end="00:54:16.600" style="s2">hadn&#39;t really thought of that so much</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.980" end="00:54:19.960" style="s2">well I mean this is the this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.600" end="00:54:22.150" style="s2">the platonic notion that training your</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.960" end="00:54:24.220" style="s2">rationality in the sense I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.150" end="00:54:26.230" style="s2">arguing for and training your sociality</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.220" end="00:54:29.740" style="s2">are deeply interpenetrating things</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.230" end="00:54:32.260" style="s2">that&#39;s why he presents his philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.740" end="00:54:35.260" style="s2">a dialogue because you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.260" end="00:54:37.770" style="s2">those two those two things our ability</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.260" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">to connect to distributed cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.770" end="00:54:42.100" style="s2">participate in collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:45.220" style="s2">and collective rationality or dare I say</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.100" end="00:54:47.830" style="s2">collective wisdom in its its in</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.220" end="00:54:49.660" style="s2">resonance with our individual project of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.830" end="00:54:52.120" style="s2">aspiring to rationality and wisdom these</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.660" end="00:54:52.690" style="s2">two things mutually afford and depend on</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.120" end="00:55:03.000" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.690" end="00:55:05.100" style="s2">hmm yeah yeah yeah and also</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.000" end="00:55:08.610" style="s2">I was just sort of thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.100" end="00:55:11.430" style="s2">how why this sort of conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.610" end="00:55:13.620" style="s2">compelling to people and stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.430" end="00:55:15.780" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a weird thing it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.620" end="00:55:18.780" style="s2">homeless or like homeless here or</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.780" end="00:55:21.150" style="s2">something yeah saying that to the guy</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.780" end="00:55:23.700" style="s2">last night it&#39;s like we&#39;re putting in</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.150" end="00:55:26.460" style="s2">these videos on YouTube it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.700" end="00:55:28.350" style="s2">the mainstream culture but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.460" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">be there seems to be a need for it for</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.350" end="00:55:35.700" style="s2">that kind of kind of totally I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:37.430" style="s2">the online world I mean it has it has</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.700" end="00:55:40.110" style="s2">sort of it has some of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.430" end="00:55:42.660" style="s2">magnifiers of the things that exhaust</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.110" end="00:55:44.190" style="s2">abate the meaning crisis you know but</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.660" end="00:55:46.230" style="s2">you know you Heidegger talks about where</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.190" end="00:55:48.570" style="s2">you know what I think he&#39;s holder lining</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.230" end="00:55:51.450" style="s2">quotes where the danger is there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.570" end="00:55:52.350" style="s2">also right the future grows I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.450" end="00:55:54.630" style="s2">a translation I might have missed</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.350" end="00:55:56.670" style="s2">translator but the basic idea is you</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.630" end="00:55:59.310" style="s2">know because it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.670" end="00:56:01.740" style="s2">destabilizing the system it&#39;s also but</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.310" end="00:56:04.530" style="s2">also it can be an affordance of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.740" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">system going through self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.530" end="00:56:08.700" style="s2">rather than disintegration you can even</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:11.850" style="s2">say a death and rebirth of some yeah</p>

<p begin="00:56:11.850" end="00:56:17.910" style="s2">and so what what I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.200" end="00:56:19.860" style="s2">happening with the Chris and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.910" end="00:56:21.300" style="s2">about the meta conversation you have all</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.860" end="00:56:22.770" style="s2">these conversations and then what</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.300" end="00:56:24.390" style="s2">YouTube is doing is setting up this</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.770" end="00:56:26.040" style="s2">thing where people are having</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.390" end="00:56:28.530" style="s2">conversations but they&#39;re doing them</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.040" end="00:56:30.750" style="s2">with the awareness right and their</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.530" end="00:56:32.370" style="s2">connectivity to other conversations so</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.750" end="00:56:33.900" style="s2">there&#39;s not only idea logos within a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.370" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s this deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.900" end="00:56:38.280" style="s2">that stay in place between all of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:40.680" style="s2">conversations and the way they constrain</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.280" end="00:56:43.860" style="s2">and impregnate and engender each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.680" end="00:56:46.170" style="s2">in this kind of complex self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.860" end="00:56:47.940" style="s2">dynamic which is really really important</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.170" end="00:56:49.470" style="s2">because you see the same thing again at</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.940" end="00:56:51.480" style="s2">least analogous and the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.470" end="00:56:53.370" style="s2">dialogues you shouldn&#39;t just ever read</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.480" end="00:56:55.380" style="s2">one platonic dialogue that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.370" end="00:56:58.350" style="s2">you should read because you should read</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.380" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">all of the ecosystem again of yes all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.350" end="00:57:02.550" style="s2">yes exactly all of the dialogues are</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:04.680" style="s2">speaking to and influencing and changing</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.550" end="00:57:06.600" style="s2">and affecting each other in powerful</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.680" end="00:57:08.700" style="s2">ways and we&#39;re doing something and now</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.600" end="00:57:10.560" style="s2">it gets to that here&#39;s a dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.700" end="00:57:12.360" style="s2">then you&#39;ve won with guy and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.560" end="00:57:14.340" style="s2">they&#39;re talked to each other and speak</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.360" end="00:57:16.170" style="s2">to each other yeah now that will inform</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.340" end="00:57:17.569" style="s2">me to speak to you and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.170" end="00:57:19.770" style="s2">somebody else might get a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.569" end="00:57:24.119" style="s2">something out of this and bring it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.770" end="00:57:25.530" style="s2">yeah yeah again to bring a Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.119" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">platonic thing and there&#39;s a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.530" end="00:57:29.309" style="s2">for Aragog a that&#39;s that reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:33.510" style="s2">opening that you and I have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.309" end="00:57:35.099" style="s2">before so the conversation when it when</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.510" end="00:57:36.809" style="s2">it moves into dialogo so you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.099" end="00:57:38.430" style="s2">reciprocal opening that&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.809" end="00:57:41.309" style="s2">that of course is again a kind of love</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.430" end="00:57:43.530" style="s2">right because people get into difficult</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.309" end="00:57:45.869" style="s2">opening that the experience they have</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.530" end="00:57:47.099" style="s2">the experience of the effect of state</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.869" end="00:57:48.930" style="s2">love isn&#39;t an emotion it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.099" end="00:57:51.000" style="s2">higher-order affective state but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.930" end="00:57:53.369" style="s2">it&#39;s an effective state and write up</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.000" end="00:57:55.890" style="s2">love enough to get how the rationality</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.369" end="00:57:57.390" style="s2">and the sociality and the love are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.890" end="00:57:59.400" style="s2">bound together</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.390" end="00:58:01.470" style="s2">how should I put them all back together</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.400" end="00:58:03.869" style="s2">uh-huh got you yeah they&#39;re they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.470" end="00:58:07.640" style="s2">sort of in little islands over here and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.869" end="00:58:10.589" style="s2">they need to come in one place exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.640" end="00:58:12.599" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why as critical of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.589" end="00:58:15.180" style="s2">Romanticism as I am of empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.599" end="00:58:17.369" style="s2">because both of them keep although those</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.180" end="00:58:19.859" style="s2">things apart but for different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.369" end="00:58:21.540" style="s2">for different positions that they hold</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.859" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">and different epistemologies and</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.540" end="00:58:26.520" style="s2">metaphysics and I think all of them are</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:30.059" style="s2">therefore equally at fault for keeping</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.520" end="00:58:32.520" style="s2">those things apart no I mean I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.059" end="00:58:34.290" style="s2">bit of a you know a gloss my other</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.520" end="00:58:36.420" style="s2">question actually I wrote that down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.290" end="00:58:38.760" style="s2">like what can we what can we take from</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.420" end="00:58:41.970" style="s2">Romanticism because romanticism is so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.760" end="00:58:45.420" style="s2">powerful it&#39;s so you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.970" end="00:58:49.799" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s so you know we need that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.420" end="00:58:52.260" style="s2">and on some level especially in our you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.799" end="00:58:54.839" style="s2">know online world people are so blase</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.260" end="00:59:00.390" style="s2">and stuff we we need to we don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.839" end="00:59:01.470" style="s2">have a feeling that that we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.390" end="00:59:03.240" style="s2">grandeur</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.470" end="00:59:06.630" style="s2">sort of experiences and emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.240" end="00:59:08.460" style="s2">that that were being too polite and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.630" end="00:59:10.440" style="s2">timid and it&#39;s it&#39;s like being in a cage</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.460" end="00:59:12.230" style="s2">of some kind in romanticism is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.440" end="00:59:16.050" style="s2">trying to break that cage a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.230" end="00:59:17.580" style="s2">it is I mean so again I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.050" end="00:59:20.070" style="s2">engage in some self-criticism and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.580" end="00:59:24.359" style="s2">actually allowed me to do so so thank</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.070" end="00:59:26.190" style="s2">you for that I mean I I try to make a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.359" end="00:59:27.750" style="s2">distinction between what I call decadent</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.190" end="00:59:29.490" style="s2">romanticism which is sort of a folk</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.750" end="00:59:32.580" style="s2">psychological version of romanticize</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.490" end="00:59:34.619" style="s2">Cheryl right and sometimes I have not</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.580" end="00:59:37.590" style="s2">been careful enough about that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.619" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">do apologize to people because you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.590" end="00:59:40.470" style="s2">to take a look at like just like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:43.020" style="s2">think you should talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.470" end="00:59:44.550" style="s2">post-modernism it&#39;s like I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.020" end="00:59:46.050" style="s2">should zero in on particular thinkers in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.550" end="00:59:50.220" style="s2">particular arguments because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.050" end="00:59:52.800" style="s2">variation and so here&#39;s what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.220" end="00:59:54.330" style="s2">say and especially the I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.800" end="00:59:56.460" style="s2">I want to call them romantics that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.330" end="00:59:57.990" style="s2">early the you know the early post</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.460" end="01:00:01.140" style="s2">contents like Schlegel and people like</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.990" end="01:00:03.540" style="s2">that I think it&#39;ll actually saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.140" end="01:00:07.619" style="s2">things remarkably similar to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.540" end="01:00:10.560" style="s2">trying to argue for and but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.619" end="01:00:12.839" style="s2">romanticism that you get especially</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.560" end="01:00:17.070" style="s2">Russo&#39;s version of Romanticism yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.839" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">which is a prototypical version of it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.070" end="01:00:20.790" style="s2">it singable romanticism and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:22.440" style="s2">say this I want to try and convey</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.790" end="01:00:24.869" style="s2">something I&#39;m gonna sit carefully</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.440" end="01:00:27.000" style="s2">and hopefully provocatively it&#39;s closer</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.869" end="01:00:28.950" style="s2">to the truth than the imperative that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.000" end="01:00:31.790" style="s2">empiricism and therefore it&#39;s think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.950" end="01:00:35.130" style="s2">more dangerous it&#39;s more dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.790" end="01:00:38.940" style="s2">because it&#39;s not contained and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.130" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">saying in a collective experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.940" end="01:00:47.310" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of okay there&#39;s that so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:50.339" style="s2">got Russo&#39;s glorification of individual</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.310" end="01:00:54.420" style="s2">subjectivity okay no that&#39;s clearly a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.339" end="01:00:55.859" style="s2">true self right yeah I mean he does have</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.420" end="01:00:57.930" style="s2">stuff about the general will but when</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.859" end="01:01:00.150" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about how he&#39;s the father</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.930" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">of Romanticism this the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.150" end="01:01:04.530" style="s2">glorification of individual subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:06.660" style="s2">is there are the idea that you come with</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.530" end="01:01:09.380" style="s2">a true self that you must be true to</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.660" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">which is antithetical to the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.380" end="01:01:14.849" style="s2">aspiration so it&#39;s antithetical to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:17.030" style="s2">ceramic ideal of aspiration the idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.849" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.030" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">this subjectivity should be thought of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:29.250" style="s2">because I so how am I trying what we was</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:31.080" style="s2">talking about it he he&#39;s he does not</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.250" end="01:01:33.330" style="s2">express enough worry about the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.080" end="01:01:36.120" style="s2">the problem of self-deception sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.330" end="01:01:38.160" style="s2">separating all of this from rationality</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.120" end="01:01:40.230" style="s2">as I&#39;ve tried to describe to describe it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:42.000" style="s2">right to put the Socratic notion of</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.230" end="01:01:43.800" style="s2">overcoming the ways in which we deceive</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.000" end="01:01:47.490" style="s2">ourselves in our self this</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.560" end="01:01:56.790" style="s2">order on the world well think about how</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.590" end="01:01:59.730" style="s2">that could just be filled with</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.790" end="01:02:04.410" style="s2">self-deception right now you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.730" end="01:02:07.190" style="s2">like projection and bias and Prejudice</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.410" end="01:02:11.310" style="s2">like all of those things right and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.190" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">romanticism doesn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s separated</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.310" end="01:02:19.050" style="s2">itself off from deep concerns about</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">human the human proclivity for</p>

<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:28.050" style="s2">which is why we we get the almost the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.760" end="01:02:30.660" style="s2">romantic trope of you know how living</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.050" end="01:02:33.150" style="s2">romantically ultimately is kind of</p>

<p begin="01:02:43.550" end="01:02:50.700" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s so appealing to people</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.710" end="01:02:54.060" style="s2">yeah I guess there&#39;s a self-destructive</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.700" end="01:02:56.100" style="s2">element in that well also a hatred of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.060" end="01:03:01.860" style="s2">civilization or a hatred of your efforts</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.100" end="01:03:08.550" style="s2">to to you know you know build things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.860" end="01:03:11.460" style="s2">yep yep so there there is a lot of so it</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.550" end="01:03:13.830" style="s2">was a terrific and I want even catch</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.460" end="01:03:16.440" style="s2">both senses of that word it was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.830" end="01:03:19.020" style="s2">terrific terrific strategy for breaking</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.440" end="01:03:20.340" style="s2">the frame of empiricist enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.020" end="01:03:23.280" style="s2">for breaking the frame that John Locke</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.340" end="01:03:25.350" style="s2">gave us of the tabula rasa mind and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.280" end="01:03:27.150" style="s2">world imposes itself in the finger of</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.350" end="01:03:28.460" style="s2">the world right so my mind it was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.150" end="01:03:32.050" style="s2">great counteractive</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.460" end="01:03:34.490" style="s2">that but I think it generates its own</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.050" end="01:03:35.780" style="s2">frame that needs to be broken and broken</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.490" end="01:03:39.380" style="s2">Bo that&#39;s well said</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.780" end="01:03:42.550" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great hmm-hmm that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.380" end="01:03:45.560" style="s2">Heidegger is so interested in being</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.550" end="01:03:48.830" style="s2">because right annan challenging the idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.560" end="01:03:50.510" style="s2">that we should impose our will on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.830" end="01:03:53.540" style="s2">world right that the world is just a</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.510" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">standing reserve because the part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.540" end="01:03:57.890" style="s2">what heidegger&#39;s trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:04:00.050" style="s2">remember is you know Locke has the mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.890" end="01:04:02.570" style="s2">as a blank slate but Rousseau has the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.050" end="01:04:06.109" style="s2">world as a blank canvas upon which we</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.570" end="01:04:08.300" style="s2">paint our subjectivity and Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.109" end="01:04:09.740" style="s2">trying to get us to remember no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.300" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">not a blank canvas</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.740" end="01:04:19.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a world it is deep and profound and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:24.589" style="s2">beyond us yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.160" end="01:04:27.380" style="s2">hmm and it discloses itself you know as</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.589" end="01:04:28.460" style="s2">it will who&#39;s feyza huh I&#39;ve heard two</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.380" end="01:04:30.140" style="s2">pronunciations and I keep getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.460" end="01:04:32.900" style="s2">corrected by both camps on how I should</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.140" end="01:04:34.730" style="s2">pronounce the Greek term I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.900" end="01:04:36.589" style="s2">broke in my intellect in my undergrad</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.730" end="01:04:37.849" style="s2">everybody pronounced it as fuzes but</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.589" end="01:04:40.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve not been told no it&#39;s not more like</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.849" end="01:04:42.830" style="s2">thesis or crisis or something or physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.940" end="01:04:44.630" style="s2">right that&#39;s the word disclosure and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.830" end="01:04:46.580" style="s2">hiding well where did we get physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.630" end="01:04:50.420" style="s2">from but it means it means the made</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.580" end="01:04:52.010" style="s2">which nature blossoms from itself blooms</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.420" end="01:04:54.800" style="s2">from itself but also the way in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.010" end="01:05:01.790" style="s2">nature loves to hide itself oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.800" end="01:05:04.520" style="s2">right right yeah yeah yeah Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.790" end="01:05:07.430" style="s2">another subject yeah Fitz yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.520" end="01:05:09.710" style="s2">mean I&#39;m having excellent conversations</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.430" end="01:05:11.690" style="s2">with Johannes about this and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.710" end="01:05:13.580" style="s2">it&#39;s up on his channel I&#39;m gonna put up</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.690" end="01:05:14.900" style="s2">the dialogue that I had with him</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.580" end="01:05:16.520" style="s2">excellent we&#39;re gonna have enough and he</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.900" end="01:05:19.010" style="s2">had guy and I are gonna talk shortly</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.520" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">about sort of Heidegger but I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.010" end="01:05:23.510" style="s2">put up the dialogue I had with Johannes</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:25.670" style="s2">I&#39;m doing it I&#39;m doing a couple new</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.510" end="01:05:27.260" style="s2">series right I&#39;m doing the minding Media</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.670" end="01:05:29.060" style="s2">series but I&#39;m also doing this series</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.260" end="01:05:32.240" style="s2">I&#39;m entitled it yet but what I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.060" end="01:05:33.859" style="s2">just I&#39;m trying to exemplify dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.240" end="01:05:36.050" style="s2">which is the psycho technology of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.859" end="01:05:39.170" style="s2">engendering deal logos I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.050" end="01:05:40.940" style="s2">exemplify that and get into these like</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.170" end="01:05:41.730" style="s2">these discussions where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.940" end="01:05:44.250" style="s2">exemplified</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.730" end="01:05:46.650" style="s2">and explicate a what what does</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.250" end="01:05:48.119" style="s2">spirituality need within the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.650" end="01:05:49.130" style="s2">worldview and the meeting crisis what</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.119" end="01:05:52.200" style="s2">does that mean for us</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.130" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">uh-huh right we had an accent</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.200" end="01:05:57.090" style="s2">conversation on Heidegger and science</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:06:01.859" style="s2">and technology yeah I loved it I saw</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.090" end="01:06:04.380" style="s2">someone half of it and I was released on</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.859" end="01:06:06.420" style="s2">mine later the other do you think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.380" end="01:06:09.300" style="s2">said what you wanted to say about about</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.420" end="01:06:12.060" style="s2">about wisdom and and and in rationality</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.300" end="01:06:13.710" style="s2">and is there any Israel want to say what</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.060" end="01:06:16.320" style="s2">sends here yeah I want to say one more</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.710" end="01:06:17.700" style="s2">thing about sort of clarifying a bit the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.320" end="01:06:21.840" style="s2">relationship between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.700" end="01:06:24.780" style="s2">rationality I think that we should think</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.840" end="01:06:27.180" style="s2">of ecologies of practices for each one</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.780" end="01:06:30.690" style="s2">of the kinds of knowing that make us</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.180" end="01:06:33.180" style="s2">more rational so you know ecologies of</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.690" end="01:06:35.369" style="s2">practice is for propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.180" end="01:06:37.530" style="s2">economies of practices for procedural</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.369" end="01:06:39.450" style="s2">knowing ecologies of practices for</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.530" end="01:06:43.050" style="s2">prospective and participatory so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.450" end="01:06:44.910" style="s2">have some examples well I think the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.050" end="01:06:47.130" style="s2">ecology of practice for propositional</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.910" end="01:06:48.869" style="s2">knowing we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.130" end="01:06:50.340" style="s2">what we and we think we know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.869" end="01:06:52.560" style="s2">talking about when we use this term I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.340" end="01:06:54.180" style="s2">going to use but if you do any</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.560" end="01:06:55.859" style="s2">philosophy around this we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.180" end="01:06:59.790" style="s2">know what we need and this is the term</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.859" end="01:07:02.280" style="s2">science science is a whole ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.790" end="01:07:05.850" style="s2">practices and it&#39;s bound up with history</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.280" end="01:07:09.530" style="s2">right yeah and it&#39;s this way of trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.850" end="01:07:12.180" style="s2">to get to be as rational as we can</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.530" end="01:07:14.220" style="s2">because I the scientific method it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.180" end="01:07:17.100" style="s2">actually a family of methods is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.220" end="01:07:18.840" style="s2">about coming to certain conclusions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.100" end="01:07:21.150" style="s2">about really trying to reduce the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.840" end="01:07:22.859" style="s2">influence of self-deception on our</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.150" end="01:07:24.150" style="s2">inferential processes and our</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.859" end="01:07:27.210" style="s2">propositional knowing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.150" end="01:07:29.850" style="s2">actually is going on the site science is</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.210" end="01:07:31.440" style="s2">largely about trying to set things up so</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.850" end="01:07:34.230" style="s2">that we can break through our patterns</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.440" end="01:07:37.350" style="s2">of self-deception right now you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.230" end="01:07:39.900" style="s2">similar things right in your procedural</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.350" end="01:07:41.609" style="s2">knowing and this is where you know I</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.900" end="01:07:45.420" style="s2">think the martial art traditions give us</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.609" end="01:07:47.580" style="s2">fantastic example well how to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.420" end="01:07:49.590" style="s2">ecologies of practices and this is where</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.580" end="01:07:53.410" style="s2">Rafe Kelly is just doing some amazing</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.590" end="01:07:57.370" style="s2">and important work right</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.410" end="01:07:59.530" style="s2">on this kind of thing not right the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.370" end="01:08:00.940" style="s2">he&#39;s using parkour and integrating it</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.530" end="01:08:02.860" style="s2">with martial art practice and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.940" end="01:08:04.690" style="s2">mindfulness but go and see some of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.860" end="01:08:07.330" style="s2">his videos see some of the dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.690" end="01:08:09.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with him mm-hm the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.330" end="01:08:11.200" style="s2">of knowing well that of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.430" end="01:08:13.330" style="s2">where all the stuff on attention and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.200" end="01:08:15.130" style="s2">awareness the mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.330" end="01:08:18.460" style="s2">right the flow induction practices are</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.130" end="01:08:21.640" style="s2">really important knowing that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.460" end="01:08:22.450" style="s2">the DLO goes that&#39;s what this is yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.640" end="01:08:24.520" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.450" end="01:08:26.620" style="s2">yeah participatory knowing we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.520" end="01:08:30.490" style="s2">to we&#39;re trying to we&#39;re trying to alter</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.620" end="01:08:32.770" style="s2">our not just our thoughts but our</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.490" end="01:08:34.840" style="s2">identities the way in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.770" end="01:08:37.480" style="s2">mutually shaping each other the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.840" end="01:08:39.910" style="s2">we&#39;re being the way us and the world are</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.480" end="01:08:41.770" style="s2">engaging so I will I&#39;m entering into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.910" end="01:08:43.240" style="s2">reciprocal opening with you but together</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.770" end="01:08:45.520" style="s2">we&#39;re also trying to enter into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.240" end="01:08:49.900" style="s2">reciprocal opening with the world right</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.520" end="01:08:52.720" style="s2">so yeah mm-hmm great great so here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.900" end="01:08:54.910" style="s2">point there let&#39;s say there are reliable</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.720" end="01:08:56.440" style="s2">systemic and reliable kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.910" end="01:08:58.060" style="s2">rationality for each of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.440" end="01:08:59.710" style="s2">knowing there&#39;s propositional</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.060" end="01:09:02.520" style="s2">rationality procedural rationality</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.710" end="01:09:04.780" style="s2">perspective of rationality and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.520" end="01:09:06.700" style="s2">participatory then you need something</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.780" end="01:09:09.400" style="s2">that optimizes the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.700" end="01:09:16.600" style="s2">all of those rationalities hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.400" end="01:09:19.060" style="s2">wisdom so wisdom is about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.600" end="01:09:21.250" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s about all between</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.060" end="01:09:27.490" style="s2">between all it&#39;s about it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.250" end="01:09:29.170" style="s2">whole yep okay okay I see it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.490" end="01:09:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s wisdom is very much a kind of meta</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.170" end="01:09:37.810" style="s2">rationality right yeah leads that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.620" end="01:09:39.850" style="s2">I would argue I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.810" end="01:09:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not identical to what that like</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.850" end="01:09:45.970" style="s2">gnosis that the world gnosis came to me</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.920" end="01:09:49.450" style="s2">to me is that each one of them I tend to</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.970" end="01:09:51.670" style="s2">think of APIs to me for a propositional</p>

<p begin="01:10:22.210" end="01:10:26.110" style="s2">goes towards the work I&#39;m doing with</p>

<p begin="01:10:26.110" end="01:10:32.920" style="s2">by the way I just want to mention I have</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.990" end="01:10:35.470" style="s2">an IndieGoGo campaign for and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.920" end="01:10:38.260" style="s2">getting any money from that campaign or</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.470" end="01:10:40.150" style="s2">from the book the money is I&#39;ve got a</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.150" end="01:10:44.170" style="s2">fine Daniel the student and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.490" end="01:10:45.580" style="s2">committing to working on this book with</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.170" end="01:10:47.260" style="s2">me and it&#39;s not on writing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.580" end="01:10:49.330" style="s2">generating art he&#39;s putting he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.260" end="01:10:51.550" style="s2">basically key like the movie producer as</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.330" end="01:10:53.380" style="s2">well as a co-author and so this money is</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.550" end="01:10:55.930" style="s2">to help to support him as he&#39;s doing all</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.380" end="01:10:57.490" style="s2">of this work but that what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.930" end="01:11:00.460" style="s2">about in the cognitive continuum is</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.490" end="01:11:02.350" style="s2">exactly this because I think and I try</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.460" end="01:11:06.100" style="s2">to argue that in the series I think we</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.350" end="01:11:07.930" style="s2">can get also instead of like instead of</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.100" end="01:11:10.090" style="s2">building a mystique around these terms</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.930" end="01:11:11.620" style="s2">and this is where like I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.090" end="01:11:14.320" style="s2">Thompson&#39;s work I think is really</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.620" end="01:11:18.040" style="s2">important also Steven Bachelor both of</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:20.350" style="s2">them are now post Buddhists because they</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.040" end="01:11:22.390" style="s2">object to Buddhist Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.350" end="01:11:25.240" style="s2">exceptionalism the idea that Buddhism is</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.390" end="01:11:27.010" style="s2">somehow a special or perverse religion</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.240" end="01:11:31.840" style="s2">compared to all the rest because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.010" end="01:11:34.420" style="s2">somehow the scientific and I object to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:36.280" style="s2">that as well I I knew you would i nee</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.420" end="01:11:38.920" style="s2">would and you have to remember that both</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.280" end="01:11:39.770" style="s2">Steven and I know I&#39;ve met Steven had</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.920" end="01:11:41.420" style="s2">dinner with him</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.770" end="01:11:43.190" style="s2">and evan is a colleague and friend of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.420" end="01:11:44.450" style="s2">mine they&#39;re both deep they&#39;re deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.190" end="01:11:47.480" style="s2">friends and Buddhism these are not</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.450" end="01:11:50.810" style="s2">hostile yeah yeah outside right and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.480" end="01:11:52.850" style="s2">right they point to the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.810" end="01:11:54.920" style="s2">what&#39;s happened is this let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.850" end="01:11:57.170" style="s2">term like enlightenment it&#39;s bound up</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.920" end="01:11:59.660" style="s2">with entire cultural projects and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.170" end="01:12:01.880" style="s2">worldviews and it often has this</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.660" end="01:12:03.800" style="s2">mystique around it I remember I let me</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.880" end="01:12:05.600" style="s2">tell you how this frustrates me you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.800" end="01:12:06.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve asked Buddhist you know how many</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.600" end="01:12:08.360" style="s2">people in the world do you think are</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.950" end="01:12:10.310" style="s2">enlightened right now and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.360" end="01:12:11.750" style="s2">well probably no one and then it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.310" end="01:12:14.030" style="s2">of my mom minded go but what the heck is</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.750" end="01:12:18.050" style="s2">it for that right I mean the term is</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.030" end="01:12:20.960" style="s2">meaningless right and so so I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.050" end="01:12:22.280" style="s2">instead just like I try to if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.960" end="01:12:25.310" style="s2">allow me I tried to reverse-engineer</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.280" end="01:12:27.500" style="s2">wisdom I tried to build it up out of</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.310" end="01:12:30.200" style="s2">fear right and and in terms of what we</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.500" end="01:12:31.160" style="s2">wanted to do and Howard well I think we</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.200" end="01:12:33.580" style="s2">should do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.160" end="01:12:36.710" style="s2">enlightenment I think enlightenment is</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.580" end="01:12:38.660" style="s2">we should reverse engineer it oh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.710" end="01:12:41.090" style="s2">terrible word isn&#39;t it it&#39;s just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.660" end="01:12:44.150" style="s2">terrible word and what I think we should</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.090" end="01:12:45.290" style="s2">do is right this is how I want to use</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.150" end="01:12:46.880" style="s2">the word and maybe we should use a</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.290" end="01:12:48.920" style="s2">different word because because of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.880" end="01:12:52.850" style="s2">critiques that Steven and especially</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.920" end="01:12:54.920" style="s2">Evan are making but I want Amy so once I</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.850" end="01:12:55.220" style="s2">have wisdom the two are gonna be bound</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.920" end="01:12:58.970" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.220" end="01:13:02.260" style="s2">I want a wise ecology of practices that</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.970" end="01:13:05.660" style="s2">it helps me transform cognition</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.260" end="01:13:07.850" style="s2">consciousness character and communitas</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.660" end="01:13:10.790" style="s2">so that I can systematically and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.850" end="01:13:13.910" style="s2">reliably overcome the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.790" end="01:13:16.790" style="s2">of self-deception and self-destruction</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.910" end="01:13:19.100" style="s2">and afford enhancing all of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.790" end="01:13:20.840" style="s2">connections what I call religio that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.100" end="01:13:25.790" style="s2">so constitutive in meeting in life for</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.840" end="01:13:28.070" style="s2">me that&#39;s enlightenment because it has</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.790" end="01:13:31.340" style="s2">to be some other deep metaphysical thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.070" end="01:13:34.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t care because I want to be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.340" end="01:13:36.710" style="s2">to help people alleviate you know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.730" end="01:13:38.660" style="s2">suffering of the perennial problems and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.710" end="01:13:40.670" style="s2">afford the flourishing of enhanced</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.660" end="01:13:41.210" style="s2">connectivity to themselves to each other</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.670" end="01:13:44.480" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.210" end="01:13:46.580" style="s2">mmm yeah so you want to stay within in</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.480" end="01:13:48.170" style="s2">the real I guess I want it and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.580" end="01:13:50.750" style="s2">to stipulate how I&#39;m gonna use the term</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.170" end="01:13:52.129" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying so there I&#39;m saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.750" end="01:13:54.349" style="s2">not using it ambiguous</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.129" end="01:13:58.189" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to not use it in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.349" end="01:13:59.780" style="s2">is loaded into a particular I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.189" end="01:14:01.519" style="s2">can&#39;t be completely free of a cultural</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.780" end="01:14:02.899" style="s2">worldview but I&#39;m not trying to bind it</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.519" end="01:14:05.209" style="s2">to a particular cultural tradition</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.899" end="01:14:07.820" style="s2">instead I&#39;m trying to pick up on what</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.209" end="01:14:10.039" style="s2">science gives us access to is Universal</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.820" end="01:14:13.119" style="s2">features and principles of our cognition</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.039" end="01:14:15.829" style="s2">and then you know the notion that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.119" end="01:14:19.849" style="s2">pragmatically engineered for a specific</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.829" end="01:14:24.949" style="s2">set of what badly and widely needed</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.849" end="01:14:27.050" style="s2">goals hmm yeah so I guess the reason</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.949" end="01:14:28.939" style="s2">this this term is so offensive is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.050" end="01:14:33.139" style="s2">it kind of I was just thinking that it</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.939" end="01:14:36.169" style="s2">kind of it implies a an end product or</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.139" end="01:14:37.849" style="s2">something it&#39;s so a deeply critical of</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.169" end="01:14:40.579" style="s2">that a deeply critical of sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.849" end="01:14:42.139" style="s2">perfection completion aspects of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.579" end="01:14:46.340" style="s2">term enlightenment are deeply critical</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.139" end="01:14:48.499" style="s2">of that people refuse to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.340" end="01:14:50.119" style="s2">that they&#39;re sliding between something</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.499" end="01:14:52.039" style="s2">that&#39;s explaining the world and</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.119" end="01:14:54.229" style="s2">something that&#39;s evaluating the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.039" end="01:14:56.090" style="s2">right it&#39;s to use sort of technical</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.229" end="01:14:58.309" style="s2">language and this is one of Evans</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.090" end="01:15:00.169" style="s2">criticisms like you don&#39;t want to you</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.309" end="01:15:02.689" style="s2">don&#39;t want to confuse your best</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.169" end="01:15:04.909" style="s2">description of how reality is with your</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.689" end="01:15:05.959" style="s2">your best sort of normative claims about</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.909" end="01:15:08.499" style="s2">how things should be</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.959" end="01:15:10.909" style="s2">those aren&#39;t those aren&#39;t the same and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.499" end="01:15:13.010" style="s2">so for example what why does that matter</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.909" end="01:15:14.929" style="s2">well science isn&#39;t doing that second</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.010" end="01:15:17.449" style="s2">thing science is not in the project uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.929" end="01:15:19.760" style="s2">this is the way things should be this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.449" end="01:15:21.619" style="s2">you know this is moral this is moral</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.760" end="01:15:23.510" style="s2">excellence this is a static excellent</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.619" end="01:15:25.579" style="s2">science isn&#39;t it it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.510" end="01:15:26.739" style="s2">machinery for doing that science is</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.579" end="01:15:27.919" style="s2">about trying to give the best</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.739" end="01:15:30.139" style="s2">explanations</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.919" end="01:15:32.570" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really afford us you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.139" end="01:15:34.760" style="s2">aspirational projects and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.570" end="01:15:36.590" style="s2">Judaism is an aspirational project and</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.760" end="01:15:38.989" style="s2">therefore to pretend that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.590" end="01:15:41.300" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s also deeply</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.989" end="01:15:43.369" style="s2">scientific ah that&#39;s a category mistake</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.300" end="01:15:45.949" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a category mistake for sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.369" end="01:15:47.689" style="s2">it&#39;s not yeah so it&#39;s just one way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.949" end="01:15:51.979" style="s2">knowing right and then Buddhism might be</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.689" end="01:15:53.570" style="s2">another way well I think a dress is</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.979" end="01:15:56.379" style="s2">something that science doesn&#39;t address</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.570" end="01:15:58.369" style="s2">which is aspirational project of</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.379" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">transformation and self transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.369" end="01:16:03.409" style="s2">and right and that it&#39;s gonna have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:05.170" style="s2">historical cultural aspect to it right</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.409" end="01:16:07.330" style="s2">yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.170" end="01:16:09.190" style="s2">what we should do what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.330" end="01:16:10.780" style="s2">do what Daniel are trying to do is well</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.190" end="01:16:13.270" style="s2">let&#39;s look at different cultural models</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.780" end="01:16:15.670" style="s2">and then let&#39;s look at this engineering</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.270" end="01:16:17.080" style="s2">this pragmatically engineering sense of</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.670" end="01:16:18.460" style="s2">enlightenment that I&#39;ve just given you</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.080" end="01:16:20.560" style="s2">and let&#39;s put them into dialogue and try</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.460" end="01:16:23.560" style="s2">and get some convergent thing that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.560" end="01:16:27.160" style="s2">has less of the off-putting mystique of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.560" end="01:16:28.990" style="s2">a lot of you know when you when you talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.160" end="01:16:31.750" style="s2">to people about enlightenment it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.990" end="01:16:35.140" style="s2">verges on the you know the supernatural</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.750" end="01:16:36.850" style="s2">and the person is becoming godlike and</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.140" end="01:16:38.140" style="s2">it&#39;s like well if that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.850" end="01:16:40.090" style="s2">then and I don&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.140" end="01:16:42.010" style="s2">disrespectfully to Buddhist but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.090" end="01:16:45.210" style="s2">interested in that I&#39;m really not</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.010" end="01:16:50.370" style="s2">interested in in and godlike people or</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.210" end="01:16:50.370" style="s2">yeah I mean I&#39;m interested I you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:58.390" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.150" end="01:17:00.100" style="s2">becoming more and more at one with sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.390" end="01:17:02.470" style="s2">of the sacred depths of reality but</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.100" end="01:17:04.510" style="s2">that&#39;s very different from it&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.470" end="01:17:06.910" style="s2">a question of growth not a question of</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.510" end="01:17:08.740" style="s2">some ultimate state or yes some ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.910" end="01:17:12.580" style="s2">state and some and some ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.740" end="01:17:14.620" style="s2">transhuman state mm-hmm so there&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.580" end="01:17:16.900" style="s2">of a niche in critiquing in my head here</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.620" end="01:17:18.490" style="s2">about stop Lee Jung you should be</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.900" end="01:17:21.130" style="s2">overcoming yourself but you should never</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.490" end="01:17:27.310" style="s2">be abandoning your humanity in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.130" end="01:17:31.090" style="s2">project so we see hey I guess I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.310" end="01:17:35.470" style="s2">guess I&#39;m gonna say something a little</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.090" end="01:17:37.000" style="s2">provocative here I I find humanity</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.470" end="01:17:39.370" style="s2">ultimately good enough this is why I</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.000" end="01:17:41.470" style="s2">love Conrad so much the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.370" end="01:17:44.950" style="s2">darkness do you compare Marlow and Kurds</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.470" end="01:17:47.320" style="s2">Kurds takes on the hubristic past of</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.950" end="01:17:48.630" style="s2">becoming a god right and then he suffers</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.320" end="01:17:52.390" style="s2">the horror of the horror the horror</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.630" end="01:17:55.930" style="s2">Marlow makes conscious decision to act</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.390" end="01:17:58.630" style="s2">to exercise restraint and stay with his</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.930" end="01:17:59.920" style="s2">humanity right that he will not even</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.630" end="01:18:01.780" style="s2">though they&#39;ll follow the journey he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:03.610" style="s2">go all the way to seeing hurts he will</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.780" end="01:18:05.050" style="s2">never abandon his humanity that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.610" end="01:18:07.480" style="s2">the heart of darkness I think it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.050" end="01:18:09.790" style="s2">a now we&#39;re fully important well that</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.480" end="01:18:11.530" style="s2">seems to be the Bodhisattva vow if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.790" end="01:18:14.380" style="s2">defending Buddhism a little bit okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.530" end="01:18:17.110" style="s2">sure uh-huh is is is is to do just that</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.380" end="01:18:19.180" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not to sate yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.110" end="01:18:20.440" style="s2">I think the Bodhisattva</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.180" end="01:18:22.600" style="s2">well it might have been a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.440" end="01:18:25.360" style="s2">corrective than in Mahayana for tear</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.600" end="01:18:27.070" style="s2">evading the because the body of October</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.360" end="01:18:28.570" style="s2">is therefore today right much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.070" end="01:18:30.370" style="s2">different than the our hat in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.570" end="01:18:31.600" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a good thought I</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.370" end="01:18:34.120" style="s2">hadn&#39;t thought about that</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.600" end="01:18:37.920" style="s2">but yeah the because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.120" end="01:18:41.380" style="s2">commitment to you staying with humanity</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.920" end="01:18:43.360" style="s2">you know and and that every being is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.380" end="01:18:45.460" style="s2">your they call it mother being it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.360" end="01:18:47.800" style="s2">every being as your mother and and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.460" end="01:18:50.680" style="s2">you have to liberate every being it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.800" end="01:18:54.520" style="s2">wild sort of idea but it&#39;s it&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.680" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">of wild heroic idea that&#39;s but it but</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.520" end="01:18:58.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not very rational certainly not I</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:00.520" style="s2">think it&#39;s rational in the way I was is</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.330" end="01:19:03.010" style="s2">Russia here we go again it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.520" end="01:19:05.800" style="s2">can&#39;t get the folk rationally iid out of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.010" end="01:19:08.680" style="s2">my head but I like that I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.800" end="01:19:12.130" style="s2">implicit is a way of deeply binding the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.680" end="01:19:14.020" style="s2">Enlightenment project to humanity yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.130" end="01:19:15.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.020" end="01:19:17.820" style="s2">injury that&#39;s a really good point i</p>
