<p begin="00:04:57.449" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">system and then people would subscribe</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.949" end="00:05:03.150" style="s2">to it and then there would be this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:06.870" style="s2">network of self publishing of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.150" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">text and video and and images and people</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.870" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">were looking at me like I was crazy it</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2">was like what are you talking about we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">had Netscape and Microsoft you know</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.729" end="00:05:20.849" style="s2">and I gave him some ideas but it really</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.470" end="00:05:22.919" style="s2">wasn&#39;t built yet but I knew that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.849" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">coming so I was looking around and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.919" end="00:05:27.599" style="s2">a company in 2001 called userland</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:29.460" style="s2">and they had the first you know personal</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.570" end="00:05:54.389" style="s2">the standard for a bit and you&#39;d get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.570" end="00:05:57.539" style="s2">feed that looked very similar to Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.389" end="00:06:00.030" style="s2">I mean it was had the RSS had that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.539" end="00:06:02.219" style="s2">know limited number of characters</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.030" end="00:06:03.479" style="s2">mm-hm and and it looked exactly like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.219" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">Twitter feed and then you could take any</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.479" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">of those items and then you could repo</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:09.240" style="s2">you know add some text to it and post it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:11.849" style="s2">to your blog so it would look basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.240" end="00:06:15.690" style="s2">a early Twitter early Facebook wow I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">back in 2001 and it got big got really</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:23.729" style="s2">the New York Times to start having them</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.789" end="00:06:27.270" style="s2">syndicate their content using RSS so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.729" end="00:06:29.460" style="s2">yeah that that kind of turned the tide</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.270" end="00:06:30.900" style="s2">on that but you know three years later</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.460" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">there&#39;s you know Facebook took out</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">started and in a dorm room using that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:39.880" style="s2">same model and Twitter took off a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:42.100" style="s2">years after that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.880" end="00:06:43.330" style="s2">we have you know what we have but wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.100" end="00:06:46.540" style="s2">able to make money on it but it was fun</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.330" end="00:06:48.850" style="s2">doing that brand RSS still very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.540" end="00:06:52.120" style="s2">well used and popular today right I mean</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.120" end="00:06:58.750" style="s2">in about 2003 I was watching what was</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.850" end="00:07:01.510" style="s2">going on with the war in Iraq and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.750" end="00:07:04.090" style="s2">some stuff that was familiar to me both</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.510" end="00:07:07.150" style="s2">you know doing you know counterterrorism</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.090" end="00:07:09.760" style="s2">counterinsurgency work earlier in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.150" end="00:07:10.990" style="s2">military career and then what I knew</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.760" end="00:07:13.000" style="s2">about the internet and open-source</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:15.250" style="s2">software development and how the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.000" end="00:07:17.050" style="s2">internet changes the way we structure</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.250" end="00:07:18.730" style="s2">organizations you know how phone systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.050" end="00:07:22.320" style="s2">you pick with us you know wireless</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.730" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">technology structures organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.320" end="00:07:26.710" style="s2">so I read started a blog called global</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">guerrillas in 2003 and started writing</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.710" end="00:07:30.070" style="s2">and I did that for years and it got</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.280" style="s2">bigger and bigger and I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.070" end="00:07:36.700" style="s2">publishing a book in 2007 called</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.280" end="00:07:37.240" style="s2">brave new war then ended up being pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.700" end="00:07:39.640" style="s2">popular</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.240" end="00:07:43.930" style="s2">you know chairman Joint Chiefs read it</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.640" end="00:07:45.970" style="s2">and was waving it around I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.930" end="00:07:49.900" style="s2">doing briefings with the CIA and the NSA</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.970" end="00:07:53.080" style="s2">and and all over the DoD and the JCS for</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.900" end="00:07:54.910" style="s2">years and what was the what was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.080" end="00:07:58.540" style="s2">basically the premise look yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.910" end="00:08:02.740" style="s2">premise is that insurgency and warfare</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.540" end="00:08:04.360" style="s2">was changing I mean that when we used to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.740" end="00:08:06.190" style="s2">fight insurgency there used to be a you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.360" end="00:08:08.320" style="s2">know single cohesive group you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.190" end="00:08:09.400" style="s2">there was a political cadre at the top</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.320" end="00:08:11.350" style="s2">and they had you know different</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.400" end="00:08:13.870" style="s2">departments that mirrored what you saw</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.350" end="00:08:15.570" style="s2">in the nation-state so you had you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.870" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">economics Ministry of propaganda and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.570" end="00:08:21.670" style="s2">then it the end result was a pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.040" style="s2">like organization so if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.670" end="00:08:27.550" style="s2">roll it up like you would in Algeria or</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.040" end="00:08:30.460" style="s2">you would in Vietnam you&#39;d work on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.550" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">bottom you find somebody that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.460" end="00:08:34.419" style="s2">vulnerable flip them and get them to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">report on the person above them and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.419" end="00:08:37.510" style="s2">on and on and on up until you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.340" style="s2">the leadership cadre and then you kill</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.510" end="00:08:42.669" style="s2">them or imprison them and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.340" end="00:08:45.520" style="s2">thing collapses well you know modernist</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.669" end="00:08:47.080" style="s2">urticae is different it looks like an</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.520" end="00:08:49.420" style="s2">open-source network and an open-source</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.080" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">software we have lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.420" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">groups coming together to build</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:55.930" style="s2">something complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:58.030" style="s2">and these groups these individuals don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.930" end="00:09:00.940" style="s2">have to agree on anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.030" end="00:09:03.430" style="s2">that they want to move the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.940" end="00:09:05.350" style="s2">forward or the product forward right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.430" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">in Iraq we had upwards of 70 different</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.350" end="00:09:11.800" style="s2">groups all cooperating together to fight</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">the insurgency and there was you know a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.800" end="00:09:16.210" style="s2">bunch of different flavors of jihadis</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.660" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">there was you know Baathists that were</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.210" end="00:09:19.930" style="s2">Pro Saddam Methodist or anti Saddam they</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:23.620" style="s2">were nationalists there were criminal</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.930" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">organizations and whenever we found one</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.620" end="00:09:29.140" style="s2">of these groups and rolled them up there</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.490" end="00:09:31.060" style="s2">was you know another 69 to go and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.140" end="00:09:32.380" style="s2">the group the group need to go up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.060" end="00:09:34.570" style="s2">like one or two layers and that was it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:38.230" style="s2">that was the end of the group and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.570" end="00:09:39.700" style="s2">there was a commercial interactions</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.230" end="00:09:42.760" style="s2">where people were selling their their</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.700" end="00:09:44.410" style="s2">expertise you know you had different you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.760" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">know when you would late in IAD there</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.410" end="00:09:48.820" style="s2">was a you know the bomb maker the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">financier the the in placer who I</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.820" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">usually had a hole in the in the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:55.300" style="s2">of the wheel you know the footwell of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">their car so they can place the ie D</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.300" end="00:10:01.330" style="s2">your then you had a Scouter who would</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">find the exact the best place to do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.330" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">and that would hit a convoy and then the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:08.980" style="s2">trigger man when the trigger people</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:10.890" style="s2">usually would video you know what they</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.980" end="00:10:14.110" style="s2">were doing and then used that as</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.890" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">collateral for selling their services to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.110" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">do the next to ided job and these were</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:20.350" style="s2">these were lessons that we learned in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.370" end="00:10:23.340" style="s2">Iraq you&#39;re saying and addressing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.350" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">that was just from Iraq so my my</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.340" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">projection was you know here&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:28.960" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:31.480" style="s2">dynamic here and that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.960" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">change you know protest politics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.480" end="00:10:37.480" style="s2">warfare and the potential is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:40.630" style="s2">gonna see a lot of disruption because of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.480" end="00:10:42.700" style="s2">these small groups can you know do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.630" end="00:10:44.440" style="s2">of damage because they can do something</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.700" end="00:10:45.970" style="s2">called systems disruption which is kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.440" end="00:10:47.590" style="s2">of like sabotage in the old days but</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.970" end="00:10:49.630" style="s2">we&#39;re much more networked in an</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.590" end="00:10:52.900" style="s2">interconnected world now and that means</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.630" end="00:10:54.610" style="s2">that systems disruption is like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.900" end="00:10:57.070" style="s2">nother you know two or three orders of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.610" end="00:10:59.470" style="s2">magnitude you know more damage if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.070" end="00:11:01.270" style="s2">hit the the system in that you&#39;re hit</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.470" end="00:11:03.070" style="s2">the network in the right place you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.270" end="00:11:04.570" style="s2">you knock out the right node you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.070" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">call it the system Punk&#39;d which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.570" end="00:11:11.050" style="s2">similar to a blitzkrieg warfare</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:13.089" style="s2">you have a chapel it&#39;s like the point of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.050" end="00:11:15.370" style="s2">greatest emphasis for breaking through</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.089" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">the enemy&#39;s line and then you know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.370" end="00:11:22.660" style="s2">send the tanks into the rear area in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:24.250" style="s2">the network warfare you would have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.660" end="00:11:26.230" style="s2">system pumped and you would knock that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.250" end="00:11:28.810" style="s2">out and that would cause a cascade of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.230" end="00:11:30.790" style="s2">failure that would knock out the entire</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.810" end="00:11:32.230" style="s2">network and then you know cascade into</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.790" end="00:11:34.990" style="s2">the next one and the next one in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.230" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">next one and that very small groups very</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.990" end="00:11:39.670" style="s2">in even individuals could could do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:45.820" style="s2">and initially I was looking mostly at</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.670" end="00:11:48.600" style="s2">the physical infrastructure rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.820" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">the online you know infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.600" end="00:11:53.290" style="s2">political and social because I figured</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:55.420" style="s2">it was harder to do it was very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.290" end="00:11:58.690" style="s2">do this the physical and we had examples</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.420" end="00:12:00.339" style="s2">of it like in Nigeria where the group</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.690" end="00:12:01.870" style="s2">called mend which is the movement for</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.339" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">the emancipation of the Niger Delta was</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.870" end="00:12:05.529" style="s2">wiping out about a million barrels a day</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:07.210" style="s2">of oil production and it was a light</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.529" end="00:12:09.520" style="s2">sweet crude that we love you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.210" end="00:12:13.510" style="s2">without the sulphur content and they did</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.520" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that in 2006 and 7 and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.510" end="00:12:16.680" style="s2">saw the same thing in Iraq where the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:20.650" style="s2">oil production that we hope to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.680" end="00:12:22.360" style="s2">after Saddam was gone didn&#39;t materialize</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.650" end="00:12:24.790" style="s2">in fact it went down because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.360" end="00:12:26.440" style="s2">insurgents are knocking out the oil so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.790" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">these lessons that we learned what does</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.440" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">that mean that we were wholly unprepared</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:32.500" style="s2">to face them because I remember it</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">seemed like Rumsfeld and the crew they</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.500" end="00:12:35.500" style="s2">wanted to you know to take out the top</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:36.790" style="s2">and they thought that that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.500" end="00:12:38.170" style="s2">gonna be the end of it if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.790" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">remembering correctly I mean this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.170" end="00:12:41.950" style="s2">while ago and I was not quite as old</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:44.170" style="s2">then as I am now but that seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.950" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">my my general you know take from just</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.170" end="00:12:50.430" style="s2">being a lay person involved Oh most</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:53.380" style="s2">definitely um yeah I they were totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.430" end="00:12:55.270" style="s2">floored I mean they were wiped out in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.380" end="00:12:57.640" style="s2">terms of ideas in terms of how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.270" end="00:13:00.040" style="s2">respond to this I mean I wrote an op-ed</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.640" end="00:13:02.500" style="s2">in the New York Times about how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.040" end="00:13:04.170" style="s2">respond to this using you know thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.500" end="00:13:07.630" style="s2">in terms of open source dynamics back in</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.170" end="00:13:10.120" style="s2">New York Times in 2005 and that got me</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.630" end="00:13:12.130" style="s2">my initial publicity and visibility to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.120" end="00:13:14.579" style="s2">write the book but when they started</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.130" end="00:13:16.810" style="s2">using the thinking in the book and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.579" end="00:13:18.700" style="s2">started looking at the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.810" end="00:13:20.210" style="s2">different way solutions presented</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.700" end="00:13:23.930" style="s2">themselves and in Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.210" end="00:13:28.310" style="s2">the interesting thing was that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.930" end="00:13:30.680" style="s2">al-qaeda in Iraq Fork the insurgency a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.310" end="00:13:33.400" style="s2">bit and what they did is they blew up</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.680" end="00:13:37.990" style="s2">the golden Mosque which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.400" end="00:13:43.990" style="s2">trying to create more of a shyah shyah</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.990" end="00:13:46.400" style="s2">civil war okay and that that initiated a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.990" end="00:13:48.560" style="s2">basically an ethnic cleansing of Baghdad</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.400" end="00:13:51.080" style="s2">where these big Shia militia started</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.560" end="00:13:53.960" style="s2">rolling through Baghdad cleansing</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.080" end="00:13:57.380" style="s2">neighborhood after neighborhood and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.960" end="00:13:59.000" style="s2">insurgents were caught between these big</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.380" end="00:14:00.410" style="s2">militias that they couldn&#39;t form a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.000" end="00:14:03.320" style="s2">enough defense to defend themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.410" end="00:14:05.420" style="s2">against them and if they did they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.320" end="00:14:06.350" style="s2">hit by the Iraqi military in the US</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.420" end="00:14:08.390" style="s2">military</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.350" end="00:14:11.480" style="s2">so they&#39;re caught in this three from</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.390" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">whore it means total total losing</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.480" end="00:14:18.230" style="s2">position all caused by the al Qaeda</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">expanding expanding the fight and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.230" end="00:14:22.430" style="s2">forking forking the insurgency and bring</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:24.590" style="s2">in a direction that wasn&#39;t designed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.430" end="00:14:26.810" style="s2">go right do you think that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.590" end="00:14:28.820" style="s2">sufficiently learned those lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.810" end="00:14:30.650" style="s2">then and from your book oh I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.820" end="00:14:33.380" style="s2">don&#39;t think so um it was just it just</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.650" end="00:14:35.030" style="s2">lucky that Petraeus was listening to his</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.380" end="00:14:37.070" style="s2">lower-level commanders and heard that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.030" end="00:14:38.570" style="s2">you know these groups are ready to flip</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.070" end="00:14:40.940" style="s2">and work with the Americans in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.570" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">stop the ethnic cleansing from wiping</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.940" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">them out and they did you know the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:48.140" style="s2">that they listened and they caught the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.860" end="00:14:49.880" style="s2">opportunity you know was it was the good</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.140" end="00:14:51.860" style="s2">thing we certainly didn&#39;t see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.880" end="00:14:56.510" style="s2">in the macro level we should have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.860" end="00:14:59.300" style="s2">we&#39;re still in Afghanistan we started</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.510" end="00:15:00.890" style="s2">doing the same kind of thing in Syria no</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.300" end="00:15:02.570" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just a bad grant strategy</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.890" end="00:15:03.980" style="s2">I that&#39;s what I wrote about in January</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.570" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">right all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.980" end="00:15:07.790" style="s2">your grant Chatterjee just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:09.260" style="s2">more on the subject before we transition</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.790" end="00:15:11.000" style="s2">which I think it is actually smooth</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:14.270" style="s2">transition into the main topic for today</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.000" end="00:15:18.430" style="s2">is what it I used to work with a guy who</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.270" end="00:15:20.750" style="s2">was when a head of one of the largest</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.430" end="00:15:22.040" style="s2">electrical associations and by that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.750" end="00:15:23.840" style="s2">mean like power companies and power</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.040" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">grids and he he used to spend a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.840" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">time cooperating with national security</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.200" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">folks to try to you know you know harden</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:34.100" style="s2">or whatever safe in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.360" end="00:15:35.420" style="s2">our vulnerability is in the electrical</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.100" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">grid because that&#39;s obviously like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.420" end="00:15:40.489" style="s2">really weak point in a high leverage</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:43.160" style="s2">opportunity for damage on a system level</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.489" end="00:15:45.110" style="s2">do you think and how are we reacting the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">United States to like the opposite sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.110" end="00:15:51.049" style="s2">of you know tactics being used against</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:51.799" style="s2">us here domestically I think we did</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.049" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.799" end="00:15:56.899" style="s2">I mean what I found is a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.720" style="s2">effectiveness of system disruption</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.899" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">depends on how tight the market is so in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.720" end="00:16:03.170" style="s2">oil because the market was tight because</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:06.709" style="s2">of Chinese demand increasing in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.170" end="00:16:08.119" style="s2">early 2000 every a bit of disruption</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.709" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">just drove the price up it went up in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.119" end="00:16:14.299" style="s2">you know 2007 remember went up to $147 a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:19.549" style="s2">barrel right yeah peaked there in the in</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.299" end="00:16:21.319" style="s2">terms of electricity it works if most</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.549" end="00:16:23.149" style="s2">effectively when when there&#39;s peak</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.319" end="00:16:25.189" style="s2">demand but it&#39;s got to be tied to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.149" end="00:16:29.299" style="s2">larger political movement there a larger</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.189" end="00:16:30.829" style="s2">political kind of situation and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.299" end="00:16:32.779" style="s2">haven&#39;t gotten to that point yet right</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.829" end="00:16:35.029" style="s2">so when we do I suspect we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.779" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">see that flare up pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.029" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s been very effective in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:40.429" style="s2">you know because once you start bringing</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:44.209" style="s2">down the infrastructure what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.429" end="00:16:46.699" style="s2">people search for sources of order and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.209" end="00:16:47.929" style="s2">sources of protection that are local if</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.699" end="00:16:51.230" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting it at the national</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.929" end="00:16:54.019" style="s2">level and that causes how you know very</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.230" end="00:16:56.119" style="s2">quick polarization right you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.019" end="00:16:58.369" style="s2">happened in Iraq happens in other places</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.119" end="00:17:01.189" style="s2">where where that kind of disruption</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.369" end="00:17:03.319" style="s2">occurs you said when we do that sound</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.189" end="00:17:05.689" style="s2">pretty certain do you think that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.319" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">type of swells are inevitable here</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.689" end="00:17:11.809" style="s2">domestically oh well no I mean I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:16.459" style="s2">probably overstep there but it okay if</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.809" end="00:17:20.059" style="s2">it happens versus when you know it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.459" end="00:17:22.569" style="s2">far easier to disrupt online in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.059" end="00:17:26.870" style="s2">disrupt social systems and it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.569" end="00:17:28.700" style="s2">disrupting physical systems right which</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:31.700" style="s2">is which is a great segue into the main</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:34.669" style="s2">conversation for today because well I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.700" end="00:17:37.820" style="s2">live I live in that online world I live</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.669" end="00:17:40.300" style="s2">in that information matrix and I have</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.820" end="00:17:43.640" style="s2">personally been involved in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.300" end="00:17:46.460" style="s2">being attacked by you know what I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.640" end="00:17:49.640" style="s2">you call us open network insurgencies</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.460" end="00:17:51.920" style="s2">and and you know basically mobs coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.640" end="00:17:54.350" style="s2">to to hit me where it hurts the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.920" end="00:17:56.870" style="s2">in my professional reputation and taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.350" end="00:17:59.660" style="s2">away my ability to earn income for my</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.870" end="00:18:01.400" style="s2">family you know getting me banned and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.660" end="00:18:04.130" style="s2">stricken from coaching Little League</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.400" end="00:18:06.560" style="s2">even even like putting pressure on my</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.130" end="00:18:09.740" style="s2">landlord to evict me from my residence</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.560" end="00:18:10.940" style="s2">all because of sort of what I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.740" end="00:18:12.890" style="s2">consider to be misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.940" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">disinformation spread about me because</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.890" end="00:18:17.480" style="s2">someone decided one day I was I was the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:18.800" style="s2">you know target right and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.480" end="00:18:20.150" style="s2">this is sort of the environment that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.800" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">living in personally and I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.150" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">about sort of the grander picture which</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:27.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve written about a ton and and I had</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.440" end="00:18:30.170" style="s2">Jordan Hall on yesterday and we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.860" end="00:18:33.050" style="s2">talking extensively about the blue</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.170" end="00:18:34.700" style="s2">church and and he was calling the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.050" end="00:18:36.140" style="s2">opposition the red religion and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.700" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">believe you have been calling it also</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.140" end="00:18:41.690" style="s2">sort of red insurgency and most my</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.380" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">listeners are definitely red versus blue</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.690" end="00:18:46.310" style="s2">and so we definitely enjoy that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.540" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">perspective and so I wanted to just</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.310" end="00:18:49.970" style="s2">start start off this conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:52.610" style="s2">you by talking about you know can you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.970" end="00:18:54.560" style="s2">tell me what is what is the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.610" end="00:18:57.290" style="s2">as you see it today and what is the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.560" end="00:19:00.410" style="s2">context and what is the context</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:02.060" style="s2">politically culturally and sort of give</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.410" end="00:19:04.220" style="s2">your definition and your sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.060" end="00:19:07.490" style="s2">perspective on that and then we can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.220" end="00:19:08.990" style="s2">know go on from there sure yeah Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.490" end="00:19:11.480" style="s2">is a good friend of mine we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.990" end="00:19:13.940" style="s2">trying to think about this for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.480" end="00:19:17.090" style="s2">quite a long time but we have slightly</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.940" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">different takes you know I I approach it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.090" end="00:19:25.040" style="s2">from what I saw in terms of how people</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:28.490" style="s2">were actually engaging in conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.040" end="00:19:30.890" style="s2">then worked back from there I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.490" end="00:19:33.620" style="s2">know theory craft first and then try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.890" end="00:19:35.330" style="s2">find examples from examples back so what</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.620" end="00:19:41.560" style="s2">I saw back in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.330" end="00:19:43.880" style="s2">ooh wow I guess it&#39;d be 2015-16 is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.560" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">there was an assertion see forming an</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.880" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">online insurgency an open-source</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:51.800" style="s2">insurgency and they were starting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:54.549" style="s2">back trumpet and that drew on the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.800" end="00:19:56.869" style="s2">the earlier Tea Party roots</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.549" end="00:19:58.429" style="s2">it all goes back to the big financial</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.869" end="00:20:00.379" style="s2">crisis that was unaddressed</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.429" end="00:20:01.999" style="s2">that kind of really shattered that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.379" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">of the legitimacy of the American</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.999" end="00:20:07.850" style="s2">government in 2008 it wasn&#39;t even so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:09.619" style="s2">much that people lost money which it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.850" end="00:20:11.509" style="s2">a big deal but it was that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.619" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">punish anyone for it right like not like</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.509" end="00:20:18.499" style="s2">not a single person was prosecuted</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:19.850" style="s2">instead yeah right and you know and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.499" end="00:20:21.830" style="s2">didn&#39;t do the you know the kind of big</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.850" end="00:20:23.299" style="s2">programs to get people out and the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.830" end="00:20:25.429" style="s2">thing is happening in Europe because of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.299" end="00:20:28.009" style="s2">German austerity they&#39;d never been able</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.429" end="00:20:32.119" style="s2">to kind of spend their way out of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.009" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">reason the return already been in since</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.119" end="00:20:37.639" style="s2">2008 so when the Germans got him in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:39.110" style="s2">hammerlock and the real estate thing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.639" end="00:20:41.299" style="s2">so it was very fascinating for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.110" end="00:20:43.580" style="s2">because at that at that time I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.299" end="00:20:45.409" style="s2">actually working in real estate and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.580" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">originally had worked for a hedge fund</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.409" end="00:20:50.899" style="s2">in 2000 2003 or so and then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:52.490" style="s2">transitioned from there into real estate</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.899" end="00:20:54.499" style="s2">and I was doing on the ground real</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.490" end="00:20:56.450" style="s2">estate development I was a a broker a</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.499" end="00:20:59.330" style="s2">builder you know in an architecture firm</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.450" end="00:21:00.950" style="s2">we did design-build we did multifamily</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.330" end="00:21:04.909" style="s2">properties commercial properties and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.950" end="00:21:06.289" style="s2">such and so like I I lived seeing people</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.909" end="00:21:08.539" style="s2">that made like fourteen thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.289" end="00:21:10.929" style="s2">a year come to the table with four for</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.539" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">loans at a hundred and fifteen percent</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.929" end="00:21:16.070" style="s2">LTV who had no business buying condos</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">and I&#39;m sitting there across the table</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.070" end="00:21:19.940" style="s2">collecting my 300 grand from this person</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:23.450" style="s2">that I knew was no not ever gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.940" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">able to to manage this and you know man</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.450" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">I lived the insanity and and with my</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">background in the hedge fund and fixed</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:32.600" style="s2">income finance I understood the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:34.669" style="s2">mortgage-backed security system and how</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.600" end="00:21:36.019" style="s2">the liquidity was being pumped into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.669" end="00:21:37.789" style="s2">system and how underwriting standards</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.019" end="00:21:39.889" style="s2">had totally collapsed and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.789" end="00:21:43.759" style="s2">basically like a giant bilking of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.889" end="00:21:46.309" style="s2">entire nation to feed Wall Street and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.759" end="00:21:48.889" style="s2">then when it all went to nobody</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.309" end="00:21:51.350" style="s2">nobody got in trouble and and when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.889" end="00:21:52.549" style="s2">both read the book the Big Short and saw</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.350" end="00:21:54.340" style="s2">the movie and I got to tell you watching</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.549" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">a movie I got emotional because it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.340" end="00:22:00.200" style="s2">such a scam perpetrated on the American</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:03.259" style="s2">people and then nobody went punished and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.200" end="00:22:04.909" style="s2">and I you know people like to blame bush</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.259" end="00:22:06.780" style="s2">or Obama for the way they handled it but</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.909" end="00:22:08.550" style="s2">the truth is they both</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.780" end="00:22:10.200" style="s2">their hand in it and it was sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.550" end="00:22:12.150" style="s2">a Democrat issue not a Republican issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.200" end="00:22:14.460" style="s2">but really an establishment issue right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.150" end="00:22:16.350" style="s2">where they both they both just turn</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.460" end="00:22:19.010" style="s2">their back on the regular people and gay</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.350" end="00:22:21.060" style="s2">and really that was the point at which</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.010" end="00:22:22.980" style="s2">income inequality and wealth inequality</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.060" end="00:22:24.690" style="s2">in the United States exploded in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.980" end="00:22:27.150" style="s2">basically straight-up fashion on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.690" end="00:22:30.150" style="s2">chart I think right right right</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.150" end="00:22:31.890" style="s2">and the legitimacy just evaporated yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.150" end="00:22:34.470" style="s2">which was the which was a key thing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.890" end="00:22:36.030" style="s2">like you know people that used to trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.470" end="00:22:37.880" style="s2">in the system actually I mean they would</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.030" end="00:22:41.430" style="s2">the trust was a little shaken after the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.880" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">Iraq war you know you know getting into</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.430" end="00:22:46.500" style="s2">into a war based on false pretences they</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:48.020" style="s2">had nothing to do with 9/11 it was just</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.500" end="00:22:51.810" style="s2">a war of choice and it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.020" end="00:22:53.940" style="s2">stupidly conceived and poorly fought and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.810" end="00:22:55.710" style="s2">you know even Afghanistan was bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.940" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">because I mean 18 years of doing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.710" end="00:22:59.730" style="s2">same thing you know next year is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:02.520" style="s2">be better let&#39;s keep on going right you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.730" end="00:23:04.260" style="s2">know that&#39;s just it shakes your trust in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.520" end="00:23:07.590" style="s2">the system but the financial crisis was</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.260" end="00:23:09.690" style="s2">really like wow I mean this is really</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.590" end="00:23:12.930" style="s2">corrupt I mean this is like this is like</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.690" end="00:23:14.490" style="s2">and when we the damage done I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.930" end="00:23:16.410" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at lost growth and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.490" end="00:23:18.810" style="s2">everything else it&#39;s about 30 trillion</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.410" end="00:23:20.070" style="s2">dollars right that&#39;s just insane amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.810" end="00:23:21.900" style="s2">of money right and we had the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.070" end="00:23:24.420" style="s2">opportunity it really was also an</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.900" end="00:23:25.980" style="s2">opportunity for us to take on this you</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.420" end="00:23:28.500" style="s2">know big project I call it you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.980" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">tilting at windmills uh but like I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.500" end="00:23:31.980" style="s2">I might write about this a windmill</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:34.890" style="s2">theory is that we need a big project in</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.980" end="00:23:36.690" style="s2">the post Cold War area mmm era to kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.890" end="00:23:39.060" style="s2">of keep us focused on the future and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:40.590" style="s2">keep us together we did that with like</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.060" end="00:23:42.390" style="s2">building the Internet in the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.590" end="00:23:44.010" style="s2">everyone was focused on that they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.390" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">absorbed our attention billions went</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.010" end="00:23:48.690" style="s2">into it and we had long-term benefits</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">from that right and then in the response</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.690" end="00:23:52.980" style="s2">to terrorism in the early 2000s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">even though we spent five and a half</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.980" end="00:23:57.870" style="s2">trillion dollars on these Wars you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">it it brought us together for about a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.870" end="00:23:59.850" style="s2">decade</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:01.110" style="s2">yeah and then we had the financial</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.850" end="00:24:03.960" style="s2">crisis and it should have brought us</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.110" end="00:24:05.160" style="s2">together cleaning it up right and and in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.960" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">getting us out of that thing but we</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.160" end="00:24:09.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t do anything right we lost and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:10.590" style="s2">all of a sudden the nation started</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.180" end="00:24:12.300" style="s2">fracturing and they going you know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.590" end="00:24:15.590" style="s2">are we doing together I mean why are we</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.300" end="00:24:18.060" style="s2">even you know are these people or even</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.590" end="00:24:20.430" style="s2">related to me or you know if I call a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.060" end="00:24:22.140" style="s2">fictive kinship is this idea of national</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.430" end="00:24:23.970" style="s2">this idea of a nation is based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.140" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">something called a fictive kinship we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.970" end="00:24:28.590" style="s2">have common stories we have common goals</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:31.830" style="s2">we&#39;re better you know they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.590" end="00:24:33.150" style="s2">related to me yeah and you know I trust</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.830" end="00:24:35.460" style="s2">what they say because they&#39;re related to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.150" end="00:24:37.800" style="s2">me right an imagined imagined order that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.460" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">we all adhere to and then we all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.800" end="00:24:42.530" style="s2">believe in the same narrative and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:44.520" style="s2">right we maintain unity and one thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.530" end="00:24:45.750" style="s2">pardon me if I meant to say this too</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.520" end="00:24:47.220" style="s2">many times throughout today but one</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.750" end="00:24:49.890" style="s2">thing Jordan said yesterday was that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.220" end="00:24:52.350" style="s2">financial crisis also was like a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.890" end="00:24:54.540" style="s2">the end of the meritocracy like right it</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.350" end="00:24:56.220" style="s2">exposed once and for all the final</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.540" end="00:24:58.290" style="s2">exposure that the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.220" end="00:25:00.780" style="s2">leading us weren&#39;t necessarily the best</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.290" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">at leading us they were just simply the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.780" end="00:25:05.310" style="s2">best at attaining power and then using</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:07.310" style="s2">it to their advantage most definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.310" end="00:25:09.780" style="s2">but it was it was a sign that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.310" end="00:25:11.940" style="s2">economic meritocracy was flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.780" end="00:25:13.950" style="s2">broken yeah because the guys that were</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.940" end="00:25:16.260" style="s2">making the big bucks were doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.950" end="00:25:18.270" style="s2">criminal fashion and they were and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.260" end="00:25:20.100" style="s2">weren&#39;t getting punished for it so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.270" end="00:25:22.710" style="s2">could you know steal a billion not go to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.100" end="00:25:24.060" style="s2">jail not even be castigated and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.710" end="00:25:26.370" style="s2">could steal a buck and you go to check</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.060" end="00:25:28.170" style="s2">all right right and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.370" end="00:25:31.140" style="s2">other side the government which is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.170" end="00:25:33.960" style="s2">and the academia and you know everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.140" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">who is you know thinking about how how</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:37.530" style="s2">to manage the country and they said you</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:39.540" style="s2">know trust us we&#39;re authorities were</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.530" end="00:25:41.250" style="s2">experts and they got it so horribly</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.540" end="00:25:42.450" style="s2">wrong right I mean you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.250" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">have people up there saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.450" end="00:25:46.500" style="s2">this is one in ten thousand year crisis</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.220" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">and you know my friend now and they seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.500" end="00:25:51.390" style="s2">collab we would talk about you know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:52.110" style="s2">dataset are you using yeah okay one in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.390" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">ten thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.110" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">we even had this system for more than a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:57.030" style="s2">couple decades so it&#39;s you know one in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:25:59.250" style="s2">ten thousand years making that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.030" end="00:26:00.780" style="s2">projection it&#39;s just nuts right but MIT</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.250" end="00:26:04.590" style="s2">showed that they were hollow that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.780" end="00:26:06.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any in a complex world the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.590" end="00:26:09.300" style="s2">world the world is too complex for their</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.300" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2">expertise to have as much value as it</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.300" end="00:26:15.450" style="s2">used to you know the world used to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.950" end="00:26:16.950" style="s2">more just complicated okay and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.450" end="00:26:19.820" style="s2">can you could you could engineers</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.950" end="00:26:24.140" style="s2">society to a certain extent using</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.820" end="00:26:26.280" style="s2">expertise and that now we&#39;re complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.140" end="00:26:27.510" style="s2">yeah would you would you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.280" end="00:26:28.920" style="s2">difference between complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.510" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">complex because that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.920" end="00:26:31.700" style="s2">sort of keeps coming up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:34.490" style="s2">conversations that I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.700" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">and it it sounds like semantics but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.490" end="00:26:38.360" style="s2">really not it&#39;s a very clear distinction</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:40.130" style="s2">right yeah I wrote up a report on that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.360" end="00:26:41.960" style="s2">couple months ago so if you get to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.130" end="00:26:45.350" style="s2">and the thing is it talked about how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.960" end="00:26:49.310" style="s2">manage a complex world or a society in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.350" end="00:26:53.090" style="s2">complex world it&#39;s this so there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.310" end="00:26:55.660" style="s2">classes of system Souza&#39;s the simple and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.090" end="00:26:57.890" style="s2">that&#39;s like simple heuristics you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.660" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">which is you know simple decision making</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.890" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">processes that we follow every day you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">know you get up in the morning and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">go to work and things like this and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:07.310" style="s2">know how to solve those and then then</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:09.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a complicated world a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.310" end="00:27:11.300" style="s2">complicated system and that&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.650" end="00:27:13.370" style="s2">you do with engineering and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.300" end="00:27:16.010" style="s2">you know doctors do you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.370" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">degrees and you can handle it lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.010" end="00:27:20.690" style="s2">complexity and things work according to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:24.910" style="s2">the rules of you know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.690" end="00:27:24.910" style="s2">developed but you know takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:31.460" style="s2">Education and to to do that well at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.030" end="00:27:34.220" style="s2">large scale and then you move into you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.460" end="00:27:37.850" style="s2">know what&#39;s called complexity in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.220" end="00:27:40.460" style="s2">complex world the system takes on</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.850" end="00:27:44.090" style="s2">characteristics that aren&#39;t predicted it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.460" end="00:27:45.620" style="s2">has emergent features and and and goes</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.090" end="00:27:47.330" style="s2">in directions that you didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.620" end="00:27:49.130" style="s2">couldn&#39;t anticipate and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.330" end="00:27:54.740" style="s2">because everything is interrelated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.130" end="00:27:56.660" style="s2">a it it creates his own tendencies and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.740" end="00:27:58.070" style="s2">and follows through with those so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.660" end="00:28:02.180" style="s2">could have a policy that goes in one</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.070" end="00:28:03.800" style="s2">direction day one and day three the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.180" end="00:28:05.450" style="s2">policy is not working anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.800" end="00:28:07.970" style="s2">the system changed completely overnight</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.450" end="00:28:10.340" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like Starbucks in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.970" end="00:28:13.700" style="s2">policy about you know having everyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.340" end="00:28:15.110" style="s2">you know pay for a coffee or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.700" end="00:28:18.020" style="s2">before they use the bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.110" end="00:28:20.450" style="s2">well the within within a day that whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.020" end="00:28:22.160" style="s2">policy was thrown to the hell we had to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.450" end="00:28:25.850" style="s2">change it and fix it and come up with</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.160" end="00:28:27.530" style="s2">something else or face another firestorm</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.850" end="00:28:29.180" style="s2">and face you know boycotts and faced all</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.530" end="00:28:30.380" style="s2">this other stuff so I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.180" end="00:28:31.790" style="s2">amazing how quickly think I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.380" end="00:28:35.570" style="s2">just a goofy little example but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.790" end="00:28:37.790" style="s2">thing is it works like that everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.570" end="00:28:39.860" style="s2">now so these guys who were experts with</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.790" end="00:28:41.450" style="s2">these you know even one year plans they</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.860" end="00:28:42.770" style="s2">can&#39;t they can&#39;t get more than a couple</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.450" end="00:28:44.230" style="s2">months into these plants before they</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.770" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">fall apart right because</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.230" end="00:28:48.490" style="s2">because acting within the system changes</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:50.860" style="s2">the system itself right yard.that just</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.490" end="00:28:52.510" style="s2">the system is just moving in directions</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.860" end="00:28:55.539" style="s2">that you can anticipate all right all</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.510" end="00:28:59.559" style="s2">right and that what you can do you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.539" end="00:29:00.940" style="s2">even really and make the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.559" end="00:29:02.950" style="s2">predictions as to what the system will</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:07.260" style="s2">be if you take undertake this action or</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.950" end="00:29:07.260" style="s2">that action often what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.620" end="00:29:12.309" style="s2">prototype or you know come up with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.730" end="00:29:14.200" style="s2">know five or six different potential</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.309" end="00:29:15.970" style="s2">actions get them out there and find</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.200" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">which one actually takes hold mmm and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.970" end="00:29:19.539" style="s2">you reinforce the one that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:22.510" style="s2">getting getting traction</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.539" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">mm-hm and and we see that we see that in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.510" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">our information conflict today right</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just the system is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:34.539" style="s2">discrediting the experts which then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.850" style="s2">know creates this kind of roiling in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.539" end="00:29:38.289" style="s2">atmosphere you know nothing seems to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.850" end="00:29:39.580" style="s2">work everything seems to be broken</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.289" end="00:29:42.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no one seems to be able to fix</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.580" end="00:29:44.350" style="s2">stuff you know we can&#39;t get healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.820" end="00:29:46.149" style="s2">because we pay three times more than</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.350" end="00:29:48.870" style="s2">everybody else and right now for</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.149" end="00:29:51.820" style="s2">instance we pay as much per capita in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.870" end="00:29:53.409" style="s2">public healthcare money as Germany and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.820" end="00:29:55.570" style="s2">every other developed country in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.409" end="00:29:58.750" style="s2">world we pay as much mm-hmm but we only</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.570" end="00:30:00.070" style="s2">insure about 1/3 of the people or if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.750" end="00:30:02.409" style="s2">want to build a piece of you know subway</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.070" end="00:30:03.970" style="s2">mile a mile of subway cost three times</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.409" end="00:30:06.010" style="s2">as much as anywhere else in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.970" end="00:30:09.159" style="s2">and the people doing the work get paid</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.010" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">the same mmm so you know you can&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.159" end="00:30:13.630" style="s2">all these like built-in things that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:15.730" style="s2">preventing us from getting things done</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.630" end="00:30:17.470" style="s2">and and you move in one direction and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.730" end="00:30:21.220" style="s2">you&#39;re facing obstacles you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.470" end="00:30:25.029" style="s2">anticipate so you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.220" end="00:30:27.639" style="s2">that this environment makes possible is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.029" end="00:30:31.269" style="s2">that you can use disruption to push a</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.639" end="00:30:33.460" style="s2">complex system into chaos right and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.269" end="00:30:36.070" style="s2">chaos it&#39;s very uncomfortable when</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.460" end="00:30:38.220" style="s2">people get really nutty and they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.070" end="00:30:40.450" style="s2">you know chaos is when everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.220" end="00:30:42.700" style="s2">making decisions on their own without</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.450" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">reference to anybody else right all</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.700" end="00:30:46.389" style="s2">right without a reference to any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:47.830" style="s2">known rules they&#39;re just making stuff up</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.389" end="00:30:49.419" style="s2">on the fly as they&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.830" end="00:30:52.149" style="s2">there they&#39;re grasping great straws and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.419" end="00:30:53.710" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not they&#39;re not working</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.149" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">in concert and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.710" end="00:30:57.340" style="s2">uncomfortable to be there and people</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:30:57.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be there what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.340" end="00:31:01.330" style="s2">if you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.880" end="00:31:03.880" style="s2">get a system into chaos like through a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.330" end="00:31:05.350" style="s2">disruption a political disruption when</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.350" end="00:31:09.130" style="s2">complexity you can reset the system you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.630" end="00:31:12.970" style="s2">can change the dynamics of the system</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.130" end="00:31:15.390" style="s2">change the dynamics of the debate we saw</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.970" end="00:31:17.890" style="s2">that happening in immigration recently</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.390" end="00:31:19.510" style="s2">every time it got chaotic it came when</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.890" end="00:31:28.120" style="s2">it came back it was moving it closer</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.510" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">towards one pole or the other so getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.120" end="00:31:31.510" style="s2">back you know getting out of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:35.050" style="s2">of this world is you know how it works</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.510" end="00:31:38.230" style="s2">is that we what I saw early on in you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.050" end="00:31:41.290" style="s2">know 2016 is that it was something I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.230" end="00:31:43.900" style="s2">called it open source insurgency and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.290" end="00:31:45.610" style="s2">had seen that in politics in Egypt in</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.900" end="00:31:47.170" style="s2">other places it was open source protest</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.610" end="00:31:48.430" style="s2">where lots of different groups</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.170" end="00:31:50.530" style="s2">everything from the Muslim Brotherhood</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.430" end="00:31:53.590" style="s2">to the Democratic groups the feminist</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.530" end="00:31:55.660" style="s2">groups in Egypt all came together in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.590" end="00:31:57.700" style="s2">open source protest and they only had</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.660" end="00:32:00.100" style="s2">one goal one plausible promise was to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.700" end="00:32:01.720" style="s2">get rid of Mubarak which was the source</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.100" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">of all their corruption and they all</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.720" end="00:32:08.290" style="s2">stayed together until that ended and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:10.450" style="s2">leadership of that protest they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.290" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">let anyone like take control of it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.450" end="00:32:15.220" style="s2">hijack it whenever they wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:15.910" style="s2">about you know a new constitution or</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.220" end="00:32:18.370" style="s2">this or that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.910" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">you know people just ignored him only</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.370" end="00:32:24.180" style="s2">the leaders actually move them towards</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:26.530" style="s2">getting rid of Mubarak they followed</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.180" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">right and so we had something similar</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.530" end="00:32:31.420" style="s2">with Trump is that he was like a grenade</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:35.710" style="s2">for the insurgency to go into Washington</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.420" end="00:32:37.210" style="s2">and disrupt it and they backed him as</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.710" end="00:32:38.800" style="s2">long as he was a grenade people</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.210" end="00:32:40.270" style="s2">continued to back him right so did you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.800" end="00:32:42.550" style="s2">see the beginning of the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.270" end="00:32:44.200" style="s2">before Trump announced and before he</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.550" end="00:32:46.210" style="s2">started shaking things up and doing his</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.200" end="00:32:48.580" style="s2">thing like the groundwork was there what</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.210" end="00:32:51.070" style="s2">were the conditions that enabled that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.580" end="00:32:53.530" style="s2">because I&#39;ve always argued that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.070" end="00:32:56.260" style="s2">Trump phenomenon is you know at least in</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.530" end="00:32:59.320" style="s2">retrospect a predictable outcome of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.260" end="00:33:01.060" style="s2">circumstances prior to the 2016 election</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.320" end="00:33:02.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that Trump came in and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.060" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">started and changed everything and made</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.650" end="00:33:07.060" style="s2">it you know bent it all to his will he</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">just happened to be whether out of pure</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.060" end="00:33:11.730" style="s2">genius or happenstance riding the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:14.440" style="s2">wave at the right time</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.730" end="00:33:16.810" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see him as much as</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.440" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">as much of a leader as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.810" end="00:33:23.380" style="s2">weapon mmm the insurgency I think I see</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:25.960" style="s2">great so they propel him forward he</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.380" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">channels them give them certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.960" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">superpowers I mean like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:34.690" style="s2">anything he&#39;s attacked for that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:36.130" style="s2">part of you know the reason the group</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.690" end="00:33:38.860" style="s2">the insurgency is held together is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.130" end="00:33:40.330" style="s2">ignored so you know all that other you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.860" end="00:33:42.280" style="s2">know Access Hollywood tapes and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.330" end="00:33:43.630" style="s2">everything else that doesn&#39;t matter it</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.280" end="00:33:45.520" style="s2">all just felt you know would kill it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.630" end="00:33:47.820" style="s2">would have killed a normal politician it</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.520" end="00:33:50.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t even touch him because people</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.820" end="00:33:52.270" style="s2">people weren&#39;t looking at him as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.410" end="00:33:53.800" style="s2">candidate per se they were seeing him as</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.270" end="00:33:55.270" style="s2">a weapon and they were sending it in to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.800" end="00:33:57.340" style="s2">Washington to break things</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.270" end="00:34:00.580" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s identified in this vase</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.340" end="00:34:07.180" style="s2">the days and the hoos well is it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.580" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">everybody who is shaken by the 2008</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.180" end="00:34:11.050" style="s2">financial crash I mean really where that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.159" end="00:34:12.820" style="s2">legitimacy was lost for them and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.050" end="00:34:14.860" style="s2">sauce things were totally broken and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.820" end="00:34:16.450" style="s2">corrupt and they want to change right</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.860" end="00:34:18.370" style="s2">and they wanted that just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.450" end="00:34:19.870" style="s2">of change they you know in fact a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.370" end="00:34:21.310" style="s2">them voted for Obama looking for that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.870" end="00:34:23.050" style="s2">change they didn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.310" end="00:34:25.090" style="s2">and the people who didn&#39;t you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.050" end="00:34:26.350" style="s2">getting it from the the Republican Party</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.090" end="00:34:28.780" style="s2">they were just you know part of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.350" end="00:34:30.100" style="s2">problem they would say that they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.780" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">trying to clean things up or you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.100" end="00:34:36.310" style="s2">XYZ and they weren&#39;t doing anything and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:37.690" style="s2">this was a chance to first in royal the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.310" end="00:34:40.590" style="s2">Republican Party oh you know take it</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.690" end="00:34:43.630" style="s2">over and then take over the White House</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.590" end="00:34:47.290" style="s2">and it you know it&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.630" end="00:34:48.820" style="s2">groups I mean it was like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.290" end="00:34:51.850" style="s2">could it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to even classify</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.820" end="00:34:53.649" style="s2">because it was more individuals and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.850" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">was like formal groups that were coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.649" end="00:34:58.570" style="s2">together under this under under know to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:35:00.090" style="s2">push Trump forward right and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.570" end="00:35:03.190" style="s2">about open source insurgencies they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.090" end="00:35:05.970" style="s2">amazingly innovative we saw this in Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.190" end="00:35:09.160" style="s2">is that you know the I Edie designs</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.970" end="00:35:10.690" style="s2">weren&#39;t developed by you know one cadre</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.160" end="00:35:12.310" style="s2">dedicated to that there were you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.690" end="00:35:13.570" style="s2">thousands of different developers and if</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.310" end="00:35:15.130" style="s2">they came up with something good they</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.570" end="00:35:17.610" style="s2">spread it throughout the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.130" end="00:35:21.220" style="s2">insurgency the plans were shared and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.610" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">like open source software and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.220" end="00:35:23.860" style="s2">we&#39;d come up we had a three billion</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:25.960" style="s2">dollar program to counter</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.860" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">IEDs we&#39;d come up with a countermeasure</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.960" end="00:35:29.860" style="s2">in three weeks later they would have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.810" style="s2">counter to our counter right right</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.860" end="00:35:34.840" style="s2">it would fast I mean they did as much in</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.810" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">about a year as the IRA did in 2003</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.840" end="00:35:38.790" style="s2">massive innovation so they were really</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:41.590" style="s2">really quick and the same thing with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.790" end="00:35:43.210" style="s2">you know Trump&#39;s insurgency is that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.590" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">were coming in in this case they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.210" end="00:35:47.110" style="s2">coming up with different types of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:51.430" style="s2">attacks and different types of framing</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.110" end="00:35:53.380" style="s2">things framing issues and he would take</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.430" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">things out of that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.380" end="00:35:58.630" style="s2">contribution basket and then give it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:01.120" style="s2">national platform either you or another</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.630" end="00:36:04.210" style="s2">you think he was he crowd-sourced his</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.120" end="00:36:07.900" style="s2">platform rather than rather than came at</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.210" end="00:36:09.100" style="s2">a top-down correct interesting yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.900" end="00:36:14.140" style="s2">mean there&#39;s lots of people of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.100" end="00:36:15.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t sorry about that yeah there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.140" end="00:36:17.170" style="s2">of people in that you know the campaign</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.640" end="00:36:18.700" style="s2">and other places that would say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.170" end="00:36:20.530" style="s2">all claiming credit for it but it was it</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.700" end="00:36:23.410" style="s2">was the this urgency they did it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.530" end="00:36:25.660" style="s2">you know I was interviewed a week after</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.410" end="00:36:27.940" style="s2">Trump on reddit the Donald all right</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.050" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">rooms I mean just they were in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:44.350" style="s2">garage innovating innovating innovating</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:45.790" style="s2">finding ways to spread it and then it</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.350" end="00:36:49.030" style="s2">went through Facebook and the cool thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.790" end="00:36:51.450" style="s2">about Facebook and the danger from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.030" end="00:36:53.650" style="s2">elite perspective is that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.450" end="00:36:55.840" style="s2">single place you could stand on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.650" end="00:36:57.580" style="s2">and see everything mmm broadcast medium</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.840" end="00:36:59.020" style="s2">right so everything is broken into these</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.580" end="00:37:00.670" style="s2">little neighborhoods and so when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.020" end="00:37:03.640" style="s2">message goes out it goes out on a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:06.730" style="s2">neighborhood level and you can&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.640" end="00:37:09.310" style="s2">from above and so is it it made it</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.730" end="00:37:13.530" style="s2">possible for lots of information and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.310" end="00:37:15.160" style="s2">lots of you know kind of insurgent</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.530" end="00:37:17.820" style="s2">mimetic kind of warfare</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.160" end="00:37:21.010" style="s2">you know disruptive stuff to get</p>

<p begin="00:43:49.950" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">we just let it go and it just you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:55.830" style="s2">you could actually map the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">counties County for County with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.830" end="00:43:59.700" style="s2">counties that were most affected by</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:00.810" style="s2">Chinese trade Wow</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.700" end="00:44:03.150" style="s2">that makes perfect sense to me I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.810" end="00:44:05.099" style="s2">remember in school we used to call we</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.150" end="00:44:07.859" style="s2">used to call that idea that false idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.099" end="00:44:09.630" style="s2">the embrace of death that like if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.859" end="00:44:11.369" style="s2">just embraced these other countries that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.630" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">they would then somehow turn it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.369" end="00:44:16.769" style="s2">to capitalistic you know free markets</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:19.829" style="s2">and free minds but that obviously didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.769" end="00:44:22.019" style="s2">work and what&#39;s what&#39;s ironic to me in</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.829" end="00:44:26.009" style="s2">some respects is looking back on the I</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.019" end="00:44:28.259" style="s2">suppose what 1999 the WTO protests in</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.009" end="00:44:31.619" style="s2">Seattle and right they were people were</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.259" end="00:44:33.869" style="s2">protesting bringing bringing China into</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.619" end="00:44:36.690" style="s2">the WTO and normalizing trade with them</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.869" end="00:44:38.190" style="s2">and man I thought I thought that all</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.690" end="00:44:41.309" style="s2">those people protesting we&#39;re a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.190" end="00:44:42.660" style="s2">loons and then 20 years later I look</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.309" end="00:44:45.420" style="s2">back and be like man they were exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.660" end="00:44:46.950" style="s2">they were exactly spot-on and ironically</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.420" end="00:44:48.359" style="s2">enough those are also some of the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.950" end="00:44:50.519" style="s2">people that would call themselves an</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.359" end="00:44:53.880" style="s2">Tifa and such today so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.519" end="00:44:56.430" style="s2">very weird circular well the China the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.880" end="00:44:57.779" style="s2">China policy I mean it you know once you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.430" end="00:44:59.970" style="s2">get the grant strategy wrong at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.779" end="00:45:01.710" style="s2">everything that follows it just gets</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.970" end="00:45:04.109" style="s2">worse and worse and worse it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.710" end="00:45:05.339" style="s2">cascade of errors I mean not only did we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.109" end="00:45:07.980" style="s2">wipe out all those jobs because of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.339" end="00:45:10.140" style="s2">Chinese trade I mean by sending all</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.980" end="00:45:12.299" style="s2">these jobs to China all this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.140" end="00:45:14.309" style="s2">manufacturing the China I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.299" end="00:45:17.279" style="s2">don&#39;t have any restrictions on pollution</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.309" end="00:45:19.499" style="s2">so they just ramped up the carbon</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.279" end="00:45:21.390" style="s2">production and now they I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.499" end="00:45:23.430" style="s2">produce more carbon than the US and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.390" end="00:45:25.559" style="s2">Europe combined Wow and accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.430" end="00:45:27.269" style="s2">away and there&#39;s absolutely nothing we</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.559" end="00:45:30.059" style="s2">could do in terms of you know cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.269" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">it up in the US to even match what what</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.059" end="00:45:35.220" style="s2">their growth is right and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">accelerated all the timelines whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.220" end="00:45:40.230" style="s2">time lines we heard about five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:41.880" style="s2">I&#39;m you know climate change those are</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.230" end="00:45:45.299" style="s2">all accelerated I mean they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.880" end="00:45:47.640" style="s2">because of China and you know the thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.299" end="00:45:49.799" style="s2">is it you know is I can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.640" end="00:45:51.539" style="s2">kind of disbelief in it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.799" end="00:45:53.160" style="s2">pushing back against all this idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.539" end="00:45:54.869" style="s2">climate because it&#39;s coming from experts</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.160" end="00:45:59.309" style="s2">right and experts are been wrong so many</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.869" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">times right but it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.309" end="00:46:04.049" style="s2">it&#39;s just good insurance</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.829" style="s2">you know prudent if you take some</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.049" end="00:46:09.509" style="s2">measures and you and you try to you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.829" end="00:46:11.549" style="s2">stop flirting let&#39;s say financial crisis</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.549" end="00:46:15.900" style="s2">uh taking some precautionary members</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.710" end="00:46:17.609" style="s2">measures is actually a smart thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.900" end="00:46:19.230" style="s2">rather than waiting till after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.609" end="00:46:20.819" style="s2">totally yeah and just just to wrap up</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.230" end="00:46:23.249" style="s2">this conversation about Japan and China</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.279" end="00:47:12.660" style="s2">of origin story for Trump&#39;s perspective</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.400" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">of the world and lived experiences have</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.289" end="00:47:58.769" style="s2">an influence on the way that we behave</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:00.660" style="s2">as we get older and it&#39;s just not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.769" end="00:48:03.089" style="s2">not an insane behavior on his part he</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.660" end="00:48:07.049" style="s2">may be he may be miscalculating but well</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.089" end="00:48:11.099" style="s2">yeah I wrote a piece of maybe last year</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.049" end="00:48:12.539" style="s2">about the thing that really upsets the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.099" end="00:48:16.170" style="s2">foreign policy types is that they think</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.539" end="00:48:18.420" style="s2">they can&#39;t see where he&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.170" end="00:48:22.230" style="s2">and the way I explained it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.420" end="00:48:24.420" style="s2">know he is putting trade policy above</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.230" end="00:48:25.890" style="s2">national security policy in a post-cold</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.420" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">war world we don&#39;t really have any</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.890" end="00:48:29.039" style="s2">enemies</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:30.779" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know and that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.039" end="00:48:33.059" style="s2">priority its economic success is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.779" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">priority so what he&#39;s doing is you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.059" end="00:48:38.819" style="s2">before you know trade policy was a slave</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:41.910" style="s2">to national security policy and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.819" end="00:48:44.789" style="s2">and we basically opened up our trading</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.910" end="00:48:46.410" style="s2">system to anyone that joined us because</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.789" end="00:48:48.869" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to take the hit in order</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.410" end="00:48:51.299" style="s2">to you know stay safe but without an</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.869" end="00:48:52.949" style="s2">enemy that becomes kind of stupid you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.299" end="00:48:54.709" style="s2">know because you&#39;re open up you opened</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.949" end="00:48:56.759" style="s2">up to like five different mercantilism</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.709" end="00:49:00.390" style="s2">mercantilist nations that are export</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.759" end="00:49:03.449" style="s2">oriented and they are all focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.390" end="00:49:06.359" style="s2">US because the US has the biggest source</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.449" end="00:49:09.390" style="s2">of demand in the world and it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.359" end="00:49:11.669" style="s2">hard for us to make money you know he by</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.390" end="00:49:13.739" style="s2">putting trade first you know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.669" end="00:49:15.390" style="s2">explains his behavior in Europe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.739" end="00:49:18.660" style="s2">particularly with Germany it explains</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.390" end="00:49:19.890" style="s2">his behavior with China and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.660" end="00:49:23.219" style="s2">something that the national security</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.890" end="00:49:24.359" style="s2">types just can&#39;t can&#39;t wrap their heads</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.829" end="00:50:04.949" style="s2">work like what is the method by which</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.779" end="00:50:06.630" style="s2">its it&#39;s exerting its will and let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.589" end="00:50:17.729" style="s2">functionality of it because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.869" end="00:50:19.769" style="s2">guys that I roll with on Twitter and in</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.729" end="00:50:22.589" style="s2">real life you know I think a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.769" end="00:50:24.209" style="s2">credibly had a major influence in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.589" end="00:50:26.369" style="s2">insurgency you know people with hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.209" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">of thousands of followers shirk millions</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.369" end="00:50:30.869" style="s2">and millions of page views and driving</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.869" end="00:50:34.439" style="s2">I have a personal interest in my</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.089" end="00:50:36.179" style="s2">listeners to definitely have an interest</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.439" end="00:50:37.919" style="s2">to think about it holistically and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.179" end="00:50:40.739" style="s2">systematically so how does this</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.919" end="00:50:42.630" style="s2">insurgency work and where you know what</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.739" end="00:50:47.849" style="s2">can we expect from it you know coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.630" end="00:50:50.219" style="s2">from moving forward okay well good place</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.849" end="00:50:52.300" style="s2">to start I have a free report up on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.219" end="00:50:55.120" style="s2">NSA it&#39;s a from dissent</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.300" end="00:50:57.070" style="s2">for 2017 it&#39;s the example I put on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.120" end="00:51:00.090" style="s2">patreon page so that&#39;s a quick download</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.070" end="00:51:03.490" style="s2">and it has it all laid out and basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.090" end="00:51:06.580" style="s2">the structure of the warfare were saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.490" end="00:51:08.830" style="s2">that I that I worked out was that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.580" end="00:51:14.310" style="s2">is this open-source insurgency that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.830" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">works according to it works in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.310" end="00:51:19.030" style="s2">mental realm the psychological space and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:20.950" style="s2">then there&#39;s this thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.030" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">resistance that works in the moral space</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.950" end="00:51:25.930" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:29.230" style="s2">corporations that work mostly in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.930" end="00:51:32.320" style="s2">the attrition area the area of physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.230" end="00:51:33.820" style="s2">connectivity okay and so these got these</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.320" end="00:51:37.840" style="s2">three players and they&#39;re defined more</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.820" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">by how they fight and the insurgency the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.840" end="00:51:42.550" style="s2">type of warfare you know that you engage</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:44.770" style="s2">in when you&#39;re in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.550" end="00:51:46.900" style="s2">psychological realm is you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.770" end="00:51:51.220" style="s2">maneuver warfare it&#39;s based on you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.900" end="00:51:54.610" style="s2">you see it in in classical you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.220" end="00:51:57.970" style="s2">examples would be blitzkrieg maneuver</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.610" end="00:52:01.720" style="s2">warfare is about you know rapid</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.970" end="00:52:03.340" style="s2">movements to wake up the mental cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.720" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">of the enemy so they can&#39;t they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.340" end="00:52:07.270" style="s2">trust the facts that they&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:09.250" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing they could become</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.270" end="00:52:13.630" style="s2">disoriented they become overloaded so</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.250" end="00:52:15.970" style="s2">we&#39;re like in World War two when a when</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.630" end="00:52:19.450" style="s2">a tank column broke through the enemy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.970" end="00:52:21.970" style="s2">lines I mean they ranged deep into enemy</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.450" end="00:52:23.380" style="s2">territory and they were feeling up at</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.970" end="00:52:24.790" style="s2">the you know the gas stations and kept</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.380" end="00:52:26.320" style="s2">on going even if there were just a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.790" end="00:52:29.170" style="s2">couple tanks they kept on going kept on</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.320" end="00:52:32.320" style="s2">going and circling these the troops at</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.170" end="00:52:33.640" style="s2">the front line and you know coming up on</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.320" end="00:52:36.010" style="s2">towns where they had command and control</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.640" end="00:52:37.690" style="s2">centers and and making them flee and to</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.010" end="00:52:40.230" style="s2">the person on the front line and where</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.690" end="00:52:42.310" style="s2">the you know bulk of the troops were</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.230" end="00:52:43.690" style="s2">they heard that you know tanks were</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.310" end="00:52:45.220" style="s2">behind him and that they weren&#39;t getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.690" end="00:52:47.230" style="s2">the ammunition and they weren&#39;t getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.220" end="00:52:48.550" style="s2">the the supplies they needed and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.230" end="00:52:50.140" style="s2">were expending him at a pretty high rate</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.550" end="00:52:54.010" style="s2">just to maintain where they&#39;re at and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.140" end="00:52:56.890" style="s2">they gave up and they just retreated and</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.010" end="00:52:59.350" style="s2">mass they couldn&#39;t process the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.890" end="00:53:02.140" style="s2">you know just a few tanks were actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.350" end="00:53:05.230" style="s2">all that stood between them and and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.140" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">rest of their supply lines it was too</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.230" end="00:53:08.920" style="s2">disoriented</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:11.320" style="s2">and the same thing we saw in in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.920" end="00:53:13.240" style="s2">online world is where you know rapid</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.320" end="00:53:17.170" style="s2">transients you know rapid switch from</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.240" end="00:53:19.660" style="s2">one disruptive idea to the next would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.170" end="00:53:22.450" style="s2">disorienting overloading things that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.660" end="00:53:24.910" style="s2">were challenging - or challenges to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.450" end="00:53:27.340" style="s2">conventional wisdom and in technique and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.910" end="00:53:29.080" style="s2">convention things that caused people</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.340" end="00:53:33.010" style="s2">pushing hot buttons to cause people to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.080" end="00:53:37.210" style="s2">explode and not think clearly that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.010" end="00:53:38.860" style="s2">works exceedingly effectively and in you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.210" end="00:53:42.070" style="s2">know the kind of psychological realm of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.860" end="00:53:44.950" style="s2">warfare and maneuver worker and Trump</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.070" end="00:53:48.070" style="s2">and his insurgency excel at that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.950" end="00:53:49.930" style="s2">that you know the standard opposition to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.070" end="00:53:51.820" style="s2">anything that would grow over time was</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.930" end="00:53:54.610" style="s2">never able to you know form in many</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.820" end="00:53:57.400" style="s2">cases like even the the the trade stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.610" end="00:53:59.170" style="s2">right so the trick we put up a various a</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.400" end="00:54:00.910" style="s2">trade and we put up new tariffs</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.170" end="00:54:02.110" style="s2">typically that would just build a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.910" end="00:54:04.450" style="s2">building in opposition to that would</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.110" end="00:54:05.950" style="s2">build and that that would dominate the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.450" end="00:54:07.870" style="s2">headlines and the pressure become</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.950" end="00:54:10.450" style="s2">intense and it forced the president to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.870" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">relent well we&#39;re switching between tone</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.450" end="00:54:14.380" style="s2">so many disruptions that stuff even</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even make it to the front page</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.380" end="00:54:18.670" style="s2">no-one&#39;s even don&#39;t even giving it any</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.810" end="00:54:21.370" style="s2">thought right over there right over look</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.670" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;s over right so the second one and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.370" end="00:54:27.270" style="s2">this came largely in response to the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:30.130" style="s2">rise of the insurgency in Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.270" end="00:54:34.300" style="s2">particulars you know flavor its</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.130" end="00:54:37.570" style="s2">particular you know approach to bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.300" end="00:54:38.830" style="s2">it is a is the resistance and this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.570" end="00:54:42.940" style="s2">more warfare this is more guerrilla</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.830" end="00:54:48.070" style="s2">warfare actually and more warfare works</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.940" end="00:54:50.350" style="s2">by creating a a moral framework that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.070" end="00:54:55.120" style="s2">serves as kind of a gravity to your side</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.350" end="00:54:56.440" style="s2">everyone comes to you and that you look</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.120" end="00:54:57.820" style="s2">at the enemy and you look for more</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.440" end="00:55:00.790" style="s2">weaknesses according to the you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.820" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">your moral framework and you call them</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.790" end="00:55:05.080" style="s2">out okay you shamed them you disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:07.510" style="s2">them that way either as individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.080" end="00:55:09.520" style="s2">as a group largely you know it works</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.510" end="00:55:11.470" style="s2">best online you know going after</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:15.490" style="s2">individuals and you were you experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.470" end="00:55:17.890" style="s2">that in a straightforward way what</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.490" end="00:55:20.200" style="s2">happens is it you know it it creates you</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.890" end="00:55:22.750" style="s2">know distrust</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.200" end="00:55:24.490" style="s2">and you just trust it you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.750" end="00:55:26.440" style="s2">target somebody that you know no one no</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.490" end="00:55:28.630" style="s2">one wants to be near them or next to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.440" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">them when they&#39;re going down everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.630" end="00:55:35.140" style="s2">starts to disassociate from that person</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:38.680" style="s2">you know in in a guerilla war you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.140" end="00:55:41.980" style="s2">if you can if you can call the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.680" end="00:55:43.690" style="s2">nation&#39;s morality into question you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.980" end="00:55:45.160" style="s2">start you can shatter it and and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.690" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">have you know multiple centers of</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.160" end="00:55:48.250" style="s2">gravity that will form and then no one</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">can make decisions because no one can</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.250" end="00:55:54.790" style="s2">agree on anything in this case you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.980" style="s2">the the kind of moral warfare that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.790" end="00:55:58.780" style="s2">seeing is proving you know pretty darn</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.980" end="00:56:01.120" style="s2">effective it&#39;s also you know moving into</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.780" end="00:56:03.790" style="s2">the economic realm with a AOC and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.120" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">like and then the third one is the</p>

<p begin="00:56:15.760" end="00:56:21.970" style="s2">them by and they tend to a lot you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.120" end="00:56:26.980" style="s2">ally themselves with the resistance and</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.970" end="00:56:29.140" style="s2">the you know my prediction back in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.980" end="00:56:31.840" style="s2">or so was I was waiting for the leader</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.140" end="00:56:34.600" style="s2">of resistance to emerge somebody would</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.840" end="00:56:37.870" style="s2">you know lead the resistance to take</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.600" end="00:56:40.810" style="s2">over the Democratic Party as effectively</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.870" end="00:56:44.110" style="s2">and as convincingly as Trump did with</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.810" end="00:56:47.050" style="s2">the Republicans and there wasn&#39;t anyone</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.110" end="00:56:48.580" style="s2">until just recently with AOC now a stage</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.050" end="00:56:50.530" style="s2">the thing is she doesn&#39;t look like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.580" end="00:56:53.380" style="s2">normal leader and stuff but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.530" end="00:56:55.690" style="s2">mean it you know she is she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.380" end="00:56:58.150" style="s2">really good online yes I mean her tweets</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.690" end="00:56:59.470" style="s2">and and her social media and Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.150" end="00:57:01.870" style="s2">and everything was really amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.470" end="00:57:03.700" style="s2">she has a you know a high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.870" end="00:57:07.120" style="s2">authenticity which is really makes her</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.700" end="00:57:08.500" style="s2">makes her very effective I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.120" end="00:57:10.840" style="s2">that little video she put up just</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.500" end="00:57:13.360" style="s2">recently about campaign finance that she</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.840" end="00:57:16.540" style="s2">critiqued yeah and that was 22 million</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.360" end="00:57:17.560" style="s2">times in 24 hours that&#39;s just nuts I</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.540" end="00:57:19.330" style="s2">mean that&#39;s like you take all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.560" end="00:57:20.320" style="s2">audiences of all the news programs and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.330" end="00:57:22.300" style="s2">you combine them and you don&#39;t get that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.320" end="00:57:23.650" style="s2">right exactly now what one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.300" end="00:57:25.300" style="s2">you brought up was that you think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.650" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">the I mean and it&#39;s obvious that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.300" end="00:57:29.370" style="s2">corporate corporate world is aligned</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:33.780" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.370" end="00:57:35.670" style="s2">with the resistance and I know that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.780" end="00:57:37.740" style="s2">corporation is a blue church all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.670" end="00:57:41.730" style="s2">media companies ad executives</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.740" end="00:57:45.000" style="s2">universities everybody is basically on</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.730" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">with the resistance and you know we see</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.000" end="00:57:49.080" style="s2">them move towards disconnecting people</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:51.090" style="s2">from you know you get unperson</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.080" end="00:57:52.770" style="s2">on the internet you get to delete it</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.090" end="00:57:55.140" style="s2">from Twitter you get and really now the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.770" end="00:57:56.850" style="s2">the real crux is like the payment</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.140" end="00:57:58.590" style="s2">disconnectors right like taking away</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.850" end="00:58:00.930" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to just even receive</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.590" end="00:58:03.420" style="s2">money that seems to be a real fatal flaw</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.930" end="00:58:06.870" style="s2">in this whole insurgency system at this</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.420" end="00:58:09.660" style="s2">point but the the the corporate world</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.870" end="00:58:13.170" style="s2">and the resistance are aligned do you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.660" end="00:58:16.410" style="s2">think that that is a stable alliance</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.170" end="00:58:19.470" style="s2">because I would argue that like the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.410" end="00:58:20.970" style="s2">Bernie guys who many of whom became</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.470" end="00:58:24.600" style="s2">Trump supporters because of their</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.970" end="00:58:26.250" style="s2">disaffected their dissatisfaction with</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.600" end="00:58:27.930" style="s2">the with big corporate with the blue</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.250" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">church with all the corruption and all</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.930" end="00:58:33.630" style="s2">of that I would have thought that like</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">the resistance folks would be anti</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.630" end="00:58:38.130" style="s2">corporation but it appears as though</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:39.840" style="s2">that they are in alignment do you think</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.130" end="00:58:41.400" style="s2">that that is a temporary thing is that a</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.840" end="00:58:45.120" style="s2">permanent thing is it because like as</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.400" end="00:58:46.740" style="s2">you described in these open insurgencies</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.120" end="00:58:47.910" style="s2">where they have a common goal even</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.740" end="00:58:49.530" style="s2">though they have different ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.910" end="00:58:50.670" style="s2">things or different ideas about what</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.530" end="00:58:52.530" style="s2">would happen after they achieve that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.670" end="00:58:56.550" style="s2">goal or different histories and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.530" end="00:58:59.610" style="s2">everything so there&#39;s a lot of tension</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.550" end="00:59:03.870" style="s2">between the corporate world and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.610" end="00:59:06.150" style="s2">resistance you know some at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.870" end="00:59:07.530" style="s2">mid-level manager space and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.150" end="00:59:10.590" style="s2">Silicon Valley companies have embraced</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.530" end="00:59:13.650" style="s2">it you know whole scale or wholesale but</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.590" end="00:59:16.440" style="s2">for the most part a lot of the corporate</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.650" end="00:59:17.400" style="s2">space is just scared of them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.440" end="00:59:19.200" style="s2">just scared they want to make money</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.400" end="00:59:21.930" style="s2">Graham but they you know they they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:23.430" style="s2">want to piss him off either do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.930" end="00:59:25.290" style="s2">really so really think making money is</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.430" end="00:59:26.940" style="s2">still the number one goal and all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.290" end="00:59:28.020" style="s2">decisions are driven by making the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.940" end="00:59:30.120" style="s2">money possible for their shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.020" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">and so they purse or even alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.120" end="00:59:33.080" style="s2">the resistance as being the best path to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:36.270" style="s2">profitability</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.080" end="00:59:37.950" style="s2">yes on the whole I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.270" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">definitely true believers in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.950" end="00:59:43.299" style="s2">the smaller companies and at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:45.069" style="s2">mid-level manager space</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.299" end="00:59:46.359" style="s2">who are like truly truly part of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.069" end="00:59:51.429" style="s2">resistance because the resistance is</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.359" end="00:59:52.989" style="s2">made it&#39;s very puritanical and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.429" end="00:59:54.399" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s different than the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.989" end="00:59:56.529" style="s2">insurgency because it&#39;s actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.399" end="00:59:59.409" style="s2">to build the you know a new consensus</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.529" end="01:00:01.769" style="s2">morality patches and baton what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.409" end="01:00:07.390" style="s2">new consensus morality based upon John</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.769" end="01:00:09.939" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s um it&#39;s re</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.390" end="01:00:12.219" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s here&#39;s the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.939" end="01:00:13.659" style="s2">we&#39;re in a globalized system and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.219" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">throwing lots of people with lots of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.659" end="01:00:16.539" style="s2">different backgrounds into the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:18.869" style="s2">system and what they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.539" end="01:00:20.609" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to renegotiate how</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.869" end="01:00:24.099" style="s2">individuals interact you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.609" end="01:00:25.509" style="s2">differentials in power mm and so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.099" end="01:00:27.459" style="s2">know a lot of this is you know based on</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.509" end="01:00:30.309" style="s2">this this core idea of intersectionality</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.459" end="01:00:31.869" style="s2">yes right and which is which is almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.309" end="01:00:34.479" style="s2">kind of the original sin of the movement</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.869" end="01:00:36.549" style="s2">because it&#39;s it has you know some flaws</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.479" end="01:00:40.929" style="s2">in it that will explode over time its</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.549" end="01:00:44.109" style="s2">fatal but yeah but the I in concept this</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.929" end="01:00:46.179" style="s2">idea of coming up with a consensus</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.109" end="01:00:49.809" style="s2">morality that were people from lots of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.179" end="01:00:53.399" style="s2">different backgrounds can agree with</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.809" end="01:00:56.169" style="s2">that kind of a minimum set of of how we</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.399" end="01:00:59.589" style="s2">rules for how we interact both online</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.169" end="01:01:03.219" style="s2">and offline may be a good thing but how</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.589" end="01:01:05.859" style="s2">they do that how they get there is is is</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.219" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">the big problem because they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.859" end="01:01:09.819" style="s2">there through intersectionality which</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:11.529" style="s2">which is like this I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.819" end="01:01:13.719" style="s2">probably gone through this on your show</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.529" end="01:01:16.779" style="s2">already and it&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.719" end="01:01:18.519" style="s2">everybody is oppressed every identity</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.779" end="01:01:21.189" style="s2">group is oppressed by other identity</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.519" end="01:01:23.499" style="s2">groups and at the end of the day you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.189" end="01:01:25.979" style="s2">know one identity group dominates over</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.499" end="01:01:30.699" style="s2">everybody else oppresses everybody and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.979" end="01:01:32.589" style="s2">and who&#39;s that oh yeah what&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.699" end="01:01:34.419" style="s2">case is you know in this this area so</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.589" end="01:01:36.699" style="s2">you know of course white heterosexual</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.419" end="01:01:40.239" style="s2">males and they&#39;re the top dogs and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.699" end="01:01:42.489" style="s2">what the the goal is to overturn that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.239" end="01:01:46.359" style="s2">mean - you know overthrow them and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.489" end="01:01:49.329" style="s2">set up a new dynamic they you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.359" end="01:01:51.609" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the people who are like</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.329" end="01:01:53.889" style="s2">into Marxist theory would say then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.609" end="01:01:56.049" style="s2">have this kind of Nirvana the realist</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.889" end="01:01:57.070" style="s2">would say you know when they look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.049" end="01:01:58.450" style="s2">communism they</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.070" end="01:02:00.010" style="s2">okay this is a chance for us to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.450" end="01:02:02.200" style="s2">control and tell everybody what to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.010" end="01:02:04.780" style="s2">yeah right and so there you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.200" end="01:02:07.600" style="s2">the difference between you know marks an</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.780" end="01:02:10.510" style="s2">A or a Lenin or Stalin right eventually</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.600" end="01:02:13.660" style="s2">that the hardcore group thinkers would</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.510" end="01:02:17.470" style="s2">win out and that you want to put your</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.660" end="01:02:19.480" style="s2">group at the top right so it makes it</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.470" end="01:02:20.500" style="s2">hard for us for me to join on I mean any</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.480" end="01:02:22.390" style="s2">group that wants to put me in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.500" end="01:02:24.370" style="s2">concentration camp it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.390" end="01:02:26.410" style="s2">you&#39;re nothing right so in my book I go</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.370" end="01:02:28.180" style="s2">into detail about kimberlé crenshaw and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.410" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">where intersectionality came from and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.180" end="01:02:32.980" style="s2">like the the the line at the end of her</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:34.930" style="s2">piece it just says I&#39;m a male white male</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.980" end="01:02:38.200" style="s2">power is implicit and understood and</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.119" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">can try to figure out and reinforce ways</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.769" end="01:08:49.589" style="s2">in which we can use this kind of new</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:52.529" style="s2">network decision-making system to make</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.589" end="01:08:55.409" style="s2">our current system better so if you look</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.529" end="01:08:57.209" style="s2">back over history you know every single</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.409" end="01:09:00.150" style="s2">new decision-making system that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.209" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">developed weaving you know found a way</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.150" end="01:09:05.009" style="s2">to make it valuable in building</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:07.130" style="s2">civilization I mean we have the old</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.009" end="01:09:09.569" style="s2">tribal thinking which is like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.130" end="01:09:14.039" style="s2">system of cohesion and fictive kinship</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.569" end="01:09:16.439" style="s2">that allows us to operate as a unit as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.039" end="01:09:18.599" style="s2">group where we trust the other members</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.439" end="01:09:21.239" style="s2">of it and that&#39;s become nationalism and</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.599" end="01:09:23.309" style="s2">you know where we you know a nation this</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.239" end="01:09:25.079" style="s2">idea of nation that were we trust other</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.309" end="01:09:26.579" style="s2">people even though we don&#39;t know them</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.079" end="01:09:27.900" style="s2">because they&#39;re Americans or because of</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.579" end="01:09:32.999" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re German in German or</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.900" end="01:09:34.829" style="s2">French or French then we had a</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.999" end="01:09:36.779" style="s2">bureaucracy which was great at</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.829" end="01:09:40.249" style="s2">mobilizing resources and you know doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.779" end="01:09:42.359" style="s2">big you know undertaking big projects</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.249" end="01:09:44.579" style="s2">that really took off in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.359" end="01:09:46.229" style="s2">got massive but you know there was</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.579" end="01:09:48.299" style="s2">meritocracy and a structured approach</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.229" end="01:09:49.859" style="s2">that would became useful and we found</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.299" end="01:09:51.809" style="s2">that the limitations of that I mean is</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.859" end="01:09:53.459" style="s2">that it can&#39;t do the you can&#39;t take over</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.809" end="01:09:55.769" style="s2">everything like we saw with communism</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.459" end="01:09:57.650" style="s2">and fascism it it can be very it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.769" end="01:10:01.050" style="s2">without moral structure and it can be</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.650" end="01:10:04.409" style="s2">used to you know scale up destruction to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.050" end="01:10:06.989" style="s2">right and then we have a markets and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.409" end="01:10:08.760" style="s2">markets are great at you know finding</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.989" end="01:10:11.849" style="s2">the the value of something and</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.760" end="01:10:13.050" style="s2">allocating resources in particular it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.849" end="01:10:14.459" style="s2">really good they&#39;re really good at you</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.050" end="01:10:16.469" style="s2">know finding the place where the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.459" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">money should flow the resources should</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.469" end="01:10:21.030" style="s2">flow and we&#39;ve combined them we when we</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:23.429" style="s2">use markets to select the leadership of</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.030" end="01:10:26.369" style="s2">the bureaucracy all right would you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.429" end="01:10:29.579" style="s2">we elect people to run our federal</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.369" end="01:10:31.530" style="s2">government and our state governments but</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.579" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">those you know are bureaucracies and</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.530" end="01:10:36.449" style="s2">they do certain things and then we use</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:38.849" style="s2">you know this tribal connectivity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.449" end="01:10:42.030" style="s2">stay together and and and make decisions</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.849" end="01:10:45.539" style="s2">as it as a cohesive unit now we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.030" end="01:10:46.649" style="s2">this new thing networks and networks are</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.539" end="01:10:47.610" style="s2">you know so far we saw with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.649" end="01:10:50.370" style="s2">insurgency it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.610" end="01:10:52.530" style="s2">at undertaking big projects this you</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.370" end="01:10:53.990" style="s2">know this Plaza will promise this one</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.530" end="01:10:57.000" style="s2">goal that a lot of people come together</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.990" end="01:10:58.740" style="s2">to to work on that&#39;s very innovative we</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.000" end="01:11:02.910" style="s2">can come up with ideas that push it</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.740" end="01:11:04.500" style="s2">forward that works great in software</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.910" end="01:11:06.810" style="s2">it&#39;s work great in protest is right</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.500" end="01:11:10.050" style="s2">we&#39;re effectively in getting say Trump</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.810" end="01:11:11.610" style="s2">into office then you have networks using</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.050" end="01:11:15.330" style="s2">the way they didn&#39;t resistance is using</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.610" end="01:11:18.720" style="s2">it is that it&#39;s using it to build</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.330" end="01:11:20.310" style="s2">something you know through consensus you</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.720" end="01:11:21.380" style="s2">know kind of a cohesive structure that</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.310" end="01:11:24.240" style="s2">it can be enforced</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.380" end="01:11:26.910" style="s2">you know limits on behavior as we go</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.240" end="01:11:30.120" style="s2">global which is like if you done right</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.910" end="01:11:32.820" style="s2">that&#39;s great if done you know to excess</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.120" end="01:11:34.440" style="s2">is going to be terrible right same thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.820" end="01:11:36.450" style="s2">with insurgency you can you can disrupt</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.440" end="01:11:38.670" style="s2">disrupt disrupt disrupt and you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.450" end="01:11:43.350" style="s2">that&#39;s good at kind of unsticking the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.670" end="01:11:44.730" style="s2">system if it&#39;s stuck you know but if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.350" end="01:11:46.890" style="s2">do too much you&#39;re just caught in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.730" end="01:11:49.350" style="s2">endless loop like Russia is right where</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.890" end="01:11:50.640" style="s2">only the oligarchs have power you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.350" end="01:11:53.610" style="s2">there are the ones only ones of making</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.640" end="01:11:56.190" style="s2">money it&#39;s just constantly disrupted and</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.610" end="01:11:58.340" style="s2">then then the third thing is this you</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.190" end="01:12:02.250" style="s2">know how to use networks deliberately</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.340" end="01:12:03.840" style="s2">you know through a eyes and I came up</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.250" end="01:12:05.310" style="s2">with some early stuff thinking early</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.840" end="01:12:11.510" style="s2">last year on that and I wrote it up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.310" end="01:12:15.300" style="s2">a you know we saw getting the AI wrong</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.510" end="01:12:17.490" style="s2">can you know accelerate disruption or</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.300" end="01:12:20.310" style="s2">right we saw that with the way they they</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.490" end="01:12:22.530" style="s2">took viral content and accelerated as it</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.310" end="01:12:25.590" style="s2">went across Facebook and across these</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.530" end="01:12:28.170" style="s2">different platforms and so if you had</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.590" end="01:12:30.030" style="s2">something that was you know extremely</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.170" end="01:12:31.830" style="s2">disruptive it got much more play than</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.030" end="01:12:35.070" style="s2">anything else because it was you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.830" end="01:12:38.490" style="s2">obviously more attractive than and more</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.070" end="01:12:42.690" style="s2">engaging and so they&#39;ve toned that down</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.490" end="01:12:44.460" style="s2">and but we can do a lot better we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.690" end="01:12:47.910" style="s2">actually use these kind of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.460" end="01:12:49.290" style="s2">I think personally AI and everyone talks</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.910" end="01:12:51.060" style="s2">about it for all these other things in</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.290" end="01:12:53.670" style="s2">it it&#39;s not really about you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.060" end="01:12:55.560" style="s2">building a solo intelligence is really</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.670" end="01:12:58.440" style="s2">about where it&#39;s actually being used</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.560" end="01:13:01.250" style="s2">most effectively and most widely is in</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.440" end="01:13:03.740" style="s2">social networks it&#39;s actually glue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.250" end="01:13:06.380" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s is turning our social</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.740" end="01:13:07.790" style="s2">system through you know social</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.380" end="01:13:11.510" style="s2">networking into a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.790" end="01:13:13.490" style="s2">technological artifact which is um which</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.510" end="01:13:15.080" style="s2">is new and McLuhan kind of predicted it</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.490" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">said we had to do that in order to kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.080" end="01:13:20.260" style="s2">of stop us from ripping our throats out</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:23.750" style="s2">all right a collective throats out</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.260" end="01:13:26.380" style="s2">but the idea that social is social</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.750" end="01:13:30.920" style="s2">networking through a I can actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.380" end="01:13:34.100" style="s2">smooth things out somewhat make us more</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.920" end="01:13:36.370" style="s2">effective as a group so you have these</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.100" end="01:13:40.010" style="s2">three different things and how we</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.370" end="01:13:41.600" style="s2">incorporate them into the larger you</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.010" end="01:13:43.220" style="s2">know social decision-making system is</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:47.120" style="s2">going to be the fight for the next 20 30</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.220" end="01:13:49.520" style="s2">years you know if you look at say world</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.120" end="01:13:52.280" style="s2">war 1 &amp; 2 was really the surprise of</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.520" end="01:13:53.240" style="s2">bureaucracy and markets I mean world war</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.280" end="01:13:55.310" style="s2">one they thought it was gonna be a short</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.240" end="01:13:57.110" style="s2">war because history history told them</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.310" end="01:14:00.020" style="s2">that there&#39;s only there&#39;s limits to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.110" end="01:14:02.780" style="s2">mobilization right and we&#39;re gonna only</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.020" end="01:14:04.280" style="s2">get a certain number of troops and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.780" end="01:14:06.680" style="s2">wars are gonna be relatively short</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.280" end="01:14:08.900" style="s2">because there&#39;s always you know room for</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.680" end="01:14:10.490" style="s2">manoeuvre but the bureaucracy was so</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.900" end="01:14:11.810" style="s2">effective at mobilizing the resources it</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.490" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">was able to put millions and men on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.810" end="01:14:17.480" style="s2">field and then immediately wiped out any</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.480" end="01:14:20.240" style="s2">kind of you know maneuverability and set</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.480" end="01:14:22.460" style="s2">everything into trenches and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.240" end="01:14:24.500" style="s2">markets proved so effective that they</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.460" end="01:14:27.020" style="s2">were able to finance all of that correct</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.500" end="01:14:28.940" style="s2">you know they were they were financing</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.020" end="01:14:31.370" style="s2">mechanism they never had up to up to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.940" end="01:14:33.530" style="s2">1900 a little different than going</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.370" end="01:14:35.420" style="s2">around and like shaking down villagers</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.530" end="01:14:37.280" style="s2">for pieces of silver I guess huh alright</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.420" end="01:14:39.110" style="s2">yeah there was just global markets like</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.280" end="01:14:40.700" style="s2">that that could finance a big buildup</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.110" end="01:14:43.100" style="s2">right and you were limited how your</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.700" end="01:14:45.020" style="s2">pocketbook so them surprises that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.100" end="01:14:47.480" style="s2">know can really cause massive Wars and</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.020" end="01:14:51.470" style="s2">unexpected with an unexpected kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.480" end="01:14:53.060" style="s2">ferocity and duration maybe it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.470" end="01:14:54.380" style="s2">to happen here as we kind of you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.060" end="01:14:56.390" style="s2">try to figure out how to use these</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.380" end="01:14:57.500" style="s2">networks this network decision-making in</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.390" end="01:14:59.840" style="s2">an effective way</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.500" end="01:15:01.580" style="s2">you know there&#39;s flaws with each way</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.840" end="01:15:04.010" style="s2">that things are being built I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.580" end="01:15:05.780" style="s2">like on the identity side in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.010" end="01:15:08.390" style="s2">resistance I mean I&#39;m personally I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.780" end="01:15:09.800" style="s2">identity as a focus is more like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.390" end="01:15:11.960" style="s2">short bus of history when everyone</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.800" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">there&#39;s you know to me now if you get on</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.960" end="01:15:15.050" style="s2">with too much identity you&#39;re gonna end</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.050" end="01:15:20.599" style="s2">yourself down right do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.570" end="01:15:22.130" style="s2">there is an a valuable iterative process</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.599" end="01:15:23.659" style="s2">between the resistance and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.130" end="01:15:28.520" style="s2">insurgency that could lead to something</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.659" end="01:15:30.099" style="s2">productive I don&#39;t know I mean you say</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.520" end="01:15:32.360" style="s2">it was a thing now that she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.099" end="01:15:34.219" style="s2">pointing a leadership face on their</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.360" end="01:15:36.889" style="s2">resistance and you notice everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.219" end="01:15:38.119" style="s2">everything that she says how she says it</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.889" end="01:15:40.219" style="s2">is all from a moral perspective</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.119" end="01:15:42.260" style="s2">everything yeah there isn&#39;t one thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.219" end="01:15:43.579" style="s2">that&#39;s not in fact when she said at the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.260" end="01:15:45.170" style="s2">State of the Union it had that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.579" end="01:15:47.300" style="s2">scowl on her face looking at Trump yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.170" end="01:15:49.219" style="s2">all the other guys were you know all the</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.300" end="01:15:51.980" style="s2">other people were there were scowling at</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.219" end="01:15:53.809" style="s2">him because you know this or that</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.980" end="01:15:56.179" style="s2">identity issue did it today you know we</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.809" end="01:15:58.969" style="s2">saw you know hot-button issues and they</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.179" end="01:16:00.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t like him she came back and said I</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.969" end="01:16:01.940" style="s2">don&#39;t like him because he doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.920" end="01:16:03.610" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.940" end="01:16:06.889" style="s2">he&#39;d never he&#39;s not taking us anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.610" end="01:16:09.349" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s a incredible</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.889" end="01:16:12.440" style="s2">wasted opportunity you know it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.349" end="01:16:14.869" style="s2">should be going somewhere and you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.440" end="01:16:17.449" style="s2">that&#39;s morally incorrect you know just</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.869" end="01:16:23.119" style="s2">to waste this opportunity right and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.449" end="01:16:25.730" style="s2">was like wow it&#39;s interesting I you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.119" end="01:16:27.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know maybe they maybe they can</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.730" end="01:16:29.469" style="s2">through their interaction develop</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.920" end="01:16:31.730" style="s2">something interesting it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.469" end="01:16:32.690" style="s2">gonna be a hell of a fight coming up in</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.730" end="01:16:36.559" style="s2">2020 yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.690" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">well that&#39;s interesting segue there I I</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.559" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">was thinking earlier that it would be</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:47.389" style="s2">Trump versus an establishment figure but</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:51.619" style="s2">you know I think you wrote that AOC has</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.389" end="01:16:54.320" style="s2">become the de facto leader of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.619" end="01:16:57.400" style="s2">resistance and therefore may become the</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.320" end="01:17:00.260" style="s2">kingmaker in the Democratic primary and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.400" end="01:17:02.480" style="s2">then that to me would seem to signal</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.260" end="01:17:04.280" style="s2">that Trump would be running against</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.480" end="01:17:08.179" style="s2">somebody who knows how to navigate his</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.280" end="01:17:11.750" style="s2">battlefield whereas before especially</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.179" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">those poor other 17th GOP guys you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.750" end="01:17:15.020" style="s2">Trump was fighting a war they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:17.630" style="s2">even know where to look to find it first</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.020" end="01:17:19.790" style="s2">of all and Hillary Clinton you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.630" end="01:17:21.739" style="s2">definitely didn&#39;t know I there and if</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.790" end="01:17:23.989" style="s2">he&#39;s Trump&#39;s running against Warren or</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.739" end="01:17:26.840" style="s2">Harris or somebody I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.989" end="01:17:28.460" style="s2">they can marshal you know his you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.840" end="01:17:28.730" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to use military where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.460" end="01:17:30.230" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.730" end="01:17:32.210" style="s2">know what I&#39;m talking about can like you</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.230" end="01:17:34.940" style="s2">know face Trump you know where Trump is</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.210" end="01:17:38.060" style="s2">but it seems seems to me that AOC could</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.940" end="01:17:40.970" style="s2">could shift that to like a a fight that</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.060" end="01:17:46.670" style="s2">happens in in territory that&#39;s familiar</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.970" end="01:17:48.950" style="s2">to both people yeah I not quite sure who</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.670" end="01:17:50.840" style="s2">she&#39;s gonna pick she may not pick it out</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.950" end="01:17:52.850" style="s2">the person outright she&#39;ll just rip down</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.840" end="01:17:54.200" style="s2">the ones that she opposes right so it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.850" end="01:17:57.560" style="s2">be kind of like a you know reverse</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.200" end="01:18:01.520" style="s2">selection and because she&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.560" end="01:18:05.239" style="s2">too young to run and that you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.520" end="01:18:07.730" style="s2">she both she and Trump are immune to any</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.239" end="01:18:10.820" style="s2">kind of standard expert based policy</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.730" end="01:18:13.700" style="s2">right critique which the media you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.820" end="01:18:15.770" style="s2">spends a lot of money doing and and in</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.700" end="01:18:17.120" style="s2">academia and standard government</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.770" end="01:18:19.130" style="s2">approach and standard you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.120" end="01:18:21.380" style="s2">establishment politics is fought over</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.130" end="01:18:23.570" style="s2">these policy quibbles you know it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.380" end="01:18:25.460" style="s2">cost too much did it you know and how</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.570" end="01:18:25.970" style="s2">are you gonna you know pay for that</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.460" end="01:18:29.180" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.970" end="01:18:31.430" style="s2">well they they&#39;re totally immune to that</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.180" end="01:18:33.050" style="s2">kind of critique you can critique them</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.430" end="01:18:34.580" style="s2">inside book and they just power right</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.050" end="01:18:38.180" style="s2">through it right it&#39;s like it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.580" end="01:18:40.430" style="s2">even happen right and and and so that</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.180" end="01:18:42.410" style="s2">puts him on a kind of a you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.430" end="01:18:43.790" style="s2">no way that she could be taken down and</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.410" end="01:18:45.200" style="s2">there&#39;s no way that Trump can be taken</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.790" end="01:18:48.440" style="s2">down because there are creatures of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.200" end="01:18:51.140" style="s2">network right they but they only can</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.440" end="01:18:54.950" style="s2">marshal minority of the population like</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.140" end="01:18:58.160" style="s2">sorry you know 35 40 percent and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.950" end="01:19:02.810" style="s2">this fight over the center you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.160" end="01:19:06.350" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s less less evil right or</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.810" end="01:19:07.970" style="s2">who&#39;s who pushes your buttons bless or</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.350" end="01:19:09.290" style="s2">pushes your buttons more yeah and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.970" end="01:19:13.130" style="s2">positive sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.290" end="01:19:15.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s a big choice if it was you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.130" end="01:19:18.470" style="s2">a resistance candidate and a certain</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.890" end="01:19:20.720" style="s2">surging candidate or that&#39;s a big choice</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.470" end="01:19:23.750" style="s2">as a big difference huge huge chasm</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.720" end="01:19:25.520" style="s2">nobody nobody building a middle ground</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.750" end="01:19:27.710" style="s2">coalition there although I would argue</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.520" end="01:19:31.489" style="s2">that Trump Trump was able to bring in I</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.710" end="01:19:33.410" style="s2">think people like me who after gay</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.489" end="01:19:37.400" style="s2">marriage was settled and pot</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.410" end="01:19:40.250" style="s2">decriminalization looked eminent didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.400" end="01:19:42.050" style="s2">have any anchors to the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.250" end="01:19:42.730" style="s2">but had always been kind of libertarian</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.050" end="01:19:44.500" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.730" end="01:19:46.240" style="s2">don&#39;t mess with me I won&#39;t mess with you</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.500" end="01:19:48.820" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a lot of people that I</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.240" end="01:19:51.100" style="s2">found ended up voting for Trump as</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.820" end="01:19:53.260" style="s2">opposed to Hillary Clinton and I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.100" end="01:19:56.110" style="s2">if the resistance puts a candidate</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.260" end="01:19:58.410" style="s2">forward who has at their core this moral</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.110" end="01:20:00.670" style="s2">concept which has at its core</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.410" end="01:20:02.740" style="s2">intersectionality which has at its core</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.670" end="01:20:04.360" style="s2">that white men are evil in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.740" end="01:20:06.040" style="s2">perpetrator of all oppression and must</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.360" end="01:20:07.840" style="s2">be destroyed and the way that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.040" end="01:20:10.180" style="s2">destroy the power of white men is</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.840" end="01:20:13.240" style="s2">through the destroying the inherent</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.180" end="01:20:15.520" style="s2">power which is their masculine power and</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.240" end="01:20:17.230" style="s2">so to me I see I see</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.520" end="01:20:20.320" style="s2">tying it all together for me and my</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.230" end="01:20:23.710" style="s2">audience here I see the resistance is</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.320" end="01:20:25.930" style="s2">gonna end up reflecting the terms of</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.710" end="01:20:27.490" style="s2">intersectionality and it&#39;s this concept</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.930" end="01:20:30.460" style="s2">this philosophy of intersectionality</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.490" end="01:20:34.030" style="s2">ideology is pushing our parties to take</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.460" end="01:20:36.880" style="s2">on the form of the diagram that it draws</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.030" end="01:20:38.740" style="s2">right so you&#39;re gonna have single women</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.880" end="01:20:41.200" style="s2">and people of color on one hand and like</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.740" end="01:20:44.320" style="s2">white men and the people that love them</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.200" end="01:20:47.170" style="s2">on the other hand and I just don&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="01:20:47.170" end="01:20:52.090" style="s2">happen but self-respecting white man can</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.870" end="01:20:54.730" style="s2">vote for a coalition that has in its</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.090" end="01:20:56.680" style="s2">party people that think that you really</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.730" end="01:20:59.380" style="s2">are the devil and should you know be</p>

<p begin="01:20:59.380" end="01:21:02.470" style="s2">to the extent that they double down on</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.640" end="01:21:06.160" style="s2">the intersectionality in that morality</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.470" end="01:21:08.950" style="s2">system you know I see the bifurcation</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.160" end="01:21:11.890" style="s2">just only get worse as he tends to move</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.950" end="01:21:15.970" style="s2">a little bit she&#39;s not like you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.890" end="01:21:17.200" style="s2">with a green new deal yeah I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.970" end="01:21:19.330" style="s2">know everyone&#39;s attacking it from the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.200" end="01:21:21.370" style="s2">socialist angle which seems to be that</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.330" end="01:21:22.720" style="s2">and then the policy people on the Left</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.370" end="01:21:26.020" style="s2">even are going that&#39;s not doable</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.720" end="01:21:27.220" style="s2">whatever but I you know I was looking at</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.020" end="01:21:28.690" style="s2">more from that you know I was talking</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.220" end="01:21:31.270" style="s2">about windmill Theory right if we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.690" end="01:21:33.340" style="s2">to have something the tilt against some</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.270" end="01:21:34.390" style="s2">big problem they maybe it&#39;s we spent</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.340" end="01:21:36.660" style="s2">five and a half trillion dollars on</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.390" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">useless wars right we didn&#39;t even win</p>

<p begin="01:24:25.269" end="01:24:29.499" style="s2">running versus an opponent and depending</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.829" end="01:24:31.359" style="s2">off close they are to the resistance if</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.499" end="01:24:33.999" style="s2">they are if the Democratic Party can</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.359" end="01:24:37.869" style="s2">under Pelosi the establishment figures</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.999" end="01:24:40.179" style="s2">will pick an establishment figure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.869" end="01:24:41.859" style="s2">gonna be a lot of infighting a real</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.179" end="01:24:43.359" style="s2">civil war inside the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.859" end="01:24:46.989" style="s2">because I&#39;ll you know they&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.359" end="01:24:48.339" style="s2">push it through really I it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.989" end="01:24:50.829" style="s2">make a prediction until that&#39;s resolved</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.339" end="01:24:53.559" style="s2">yeah right so that so we got really to</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.829" end="01:24:54.879" style="s2">to kind of conflicts going there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.559" end="01:24:58.889" style="s2">fight for control of the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.879" end="01:25:04.749" style="s2">Party between ASC and her group and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.889" end="01:25:07.479" style="s2">Pelosi and her group and then and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.749" end="01:25:10.989" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think that the Mueller</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.479" end="01:25:12.879" style="s2">things are gonna tank Trump know okay I</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.989" end="01:25:15.309" style="s2">mean because that those investigations</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.879" end="01:25:17.739" style="s2">really they have to actually reduce his</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.309" end="01:25:20.499" style="s2">popularity in order to work because he</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.739" end="01:25:21.939" style="s2">goes there&#39;s no there&#39;s no legal means</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.499" end="01:25:23.530" style="s2">of getting rid of them outside of</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.939" end="01:25:26.289" style="s2">reducing his popularity and make him</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.530" end="01:25:27.519" style="s2">vulnerable to a Senate vote so uh so</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.289" end="01:25:29.320" style="s2">many people think that there is actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.519" end="01:25:32.589" style="s2">some kind of legal process for removing</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.320" end="01:25:36.269" style="s2">them that is inexorable it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.589" end="01:25:39.159" style="s2">require you know popularity or vote</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.269" end="01:25:43.479" style="s2">so he&#39;ll probably be in line on barring</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.159" end="01:25:45.339" style="s2">a heart attack going into 2020 yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.479" end="01:25:46.869" style="s2">until that until the Dems have you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.339" end="01:25:51.609" style="s2">resolved their civil war I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.869" end="01:25:53.320" style="s2">going to be whoever a OC picks Trump</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.609" end="01:25:55.179" style="s2">Trump versus an establishment candidate</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.320" end="01:25:57.519" style="s2">or Trump now I don&#39;t functional versus a</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.179" end="01:25:58.809" style="s2">resistance candidate well you know if</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.519" end="01:25:59.919" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s a resistance candidate</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.809" end="01:26:01.329" style="s2">comes out of the Democratic Party and</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.919" end="01:26:03.609" style="s2">it&#39;s versus Trump there may be an</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.329" end="01:26:05.109" style="s2">establishment third party yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.609" end="01:26:08.070" style="s2">which would then make it really truly</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.109" end="01:26:10.239" style="s2">chaotic yeah okay so everybody&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.070" end="01:26:13.179" style="s2">particularly if the establishment person</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.239" end="01:26:15.969" style="s2">is a little bit to the right true</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.179" end="01:26:17.139" style="s2">alright yeah yeah it becomes and you</p>

<p begin="01:26:27.930" end="01:26:31.710" style="s2">signed on there can be interesting um</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.700" end="01:26:33.300" style="s2">you know there&#39;s always a outlier that</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.710" end="01:26:34.980" style="s2">things could get disrupted to the point</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.300" end="01:26:37.410" style="s2">because people are polarizing to the you</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.980" end="01:26:38.850" style="s2">know to a high degree that we can end up</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.410" end="01:26:42.570" style="s2">with a couple incidents that roll us</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.850" end="01:26:43.920" style="s2">into a you know a civil conflict it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:26:53.640" end="01:26:58.140" style="s2">radically we&#39;re rapidly destroying all</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.860" end="01:27:00.180" style="s2">the common narratives and stories you</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.140" end="01:27:01.830" style="s2">know that can unite us and and people</p>

<p begin="01:27:04.140" end="01:27:12.120" style="s2">right so this is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:13.470" style="s2">point and the American nationalism man I</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.120" end="01:27:19.290" style="s2">can&#39;t believe I&#39;m gonna wait into this</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.470" end="01:27:23.040" style="s2">here American nationalism today is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.290" end="01:27:25.050" style="s2">shared belief in an imagined order that</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.040" end="01:27:27.000" style="s2">believes we thought in personal liberty</p>

<p begin="01:27:44.640" end="01:27:51.300" style="s2">if if the imagined order breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.960" end="01:27:56.820" style="s2">what is it that&#39;s going to bind us as a</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.300" end="01:27:59.640" style="s2">nation well that&#39;s the that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.820" end="01:28:01.260" style="s2">that we have to create using networking</p>

<p begin="01:28:23.100" end="01:28:29.040" style="s2">who&#39;s working on that oh we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.340" end="01:28:31.440" style="s2">working on it yeah online right now but</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.040" end="01:28:33.290" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely true if you go to Europe</p>

<p begin="01:28:44.090" end="01:28:47.810" style="s2">this in the States</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.930" end="01:28:50.840" style="s2">well you know why you just basically let</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.810" end="01:28:52.580" style="s2">people you know twist in the wind you</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.840" end="01:28:54.680" style="s2">know and without any kind of government</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.580" end="01:28:56.780" style="s2">support and I go oh it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.680" end="01:28:59.030" style="s2">matter of perspective in Germany</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.780" end="01:29:04.220" style="s2">everyone&#39;s kind of like related you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.030" end="01:29:05.210" style="s2">you have a very very cohesive ethnic</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.220" end="01:29:08.870" style="s2">outlook or you know the historical</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.210" end="01:29:12.170" style="s2">outlook and it&#39;s like it&#39;s um it creates</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.870" end="01:29:14.510" style="s2">a different dynamic then here it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.170" end="01:29:18.140" style="s2">you know very competitive here Polk can</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.510" end="01:29:20.870" style="s2">we can we develop something new it</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.140" end="01:29:22.880" style="s2">really depends on how we how well we do</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.870" end="01:29:24.590" style="s2">online because it on lines were we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.880" end="01:29:26.360" style="s2">gonna develop it right so we&#39;ve taught</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.590" end="01:29:29.120" style="s2">this would be my last question and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.360" end="01:29:30.860" style="s2">wrap the weave the word cohesion has</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.120" end="01:29:33.620" style="s2">come up a number of times</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.860" end="01:29:35.710" style="s2">Jordan Hall did a great job in his</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.620" end="01:29:38.540" style="s2">situational assessments and other pieces</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.710" end="01:29:40.490" style="s2">describing the way that the blue church</p>

<p begin="01:29:42.740" end="01:29:47.390" style="s2">at generating group cohesion and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.740" end="01:29:49.340" style="s2">seems as though that these networks that</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.390" end="01:29:52.340" style="s2">have emerged have become effective at</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.340" end="01:29:55.570" style="s2">disrupting group cohesion if I&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.340" end="01:29:59.120" style="s2">okay but if I&#39;m wrong tell me but the</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.570" end="01:30:00.980" style="s2">are the networks that are evolving are</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.120" end="01:30:02.810" style="s2">they inherently disruptive to group</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.980" end="01:30:08.030" style="s2">cohesion or can they be used in a</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.810" end="01:30:11.180" style="s2">positive way disruptive to the cohesion</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.030" end="01:30:12.830" style="s2">of the of their opposition sure yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.180" end="01:30:15.800" style="s2">within the context of the group it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.830" end="01:30:17.480" style="s2">lot of cohesion in more more importantly</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.800" end="01:30:19.600" style="s2">than cohesion something more important</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.480" end="01:30:22.970" style="s2">than cohesion is coherence</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.600" end="01:30:24.260" style="s2">I&#39;m just understanding well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.970" end="01:30:27.110" style="s2">the ability to actually formulate</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.260" end="01:30:29.930" style="s2">thought and you know run through it a</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.110" end="01:30:32.090" style="s2">decision-making process to the end I</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.930" end="01:30:34.160" style="s2">mean when you when you don&#39;t have any</p>

<p begin="01:30:34.160" end="01:30:37.700" style="s2">I&#39;m a fictive kinship everything they</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.690" end="01:30:40.820" style="s2">say the information that they present</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.700" end="01:30:43.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t trusted mmm so you can&#39;t use that</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.820" end="01:30:44.180" style="s2">in your you don&#39;t believe them you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.160" end="01:30:45.050" style="s2">know if they&#39;re gonna actually do</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.180" end="01:30:47.130" style="s2">something that&#39;s giving you that</p>

<p begin="01:30:47.130" end="01:30:53.910" style="s2">thank you you want to do do you harm</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.570" end="01:30:57.660" style="s2">so and then then if you were living in a</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.910" end="01:30:59.490" style="s2">if the the the psychological realm if</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.660" end="01:31:02.160" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of fake information and</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.490" end="01:31:05.400" style="s2">spun information the motive conjugation</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.160" end="01:31:07.500" style="s2">of you know and all the things that</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.400" end="01:31:09.450" style="s2">would actually you know spin info you</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.500" end="01:31:11.990" style="s2">don&#39;t even trust the info itself you</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.450" end="01:31:14.430" style="s2">know and how it&#39;s being you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.990" end="01:31:16.920" style="s2">presented right and so how can you make</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.430" end="01:31:20.010" style="s2">good decisions there and then then you</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.920" end="01:31:21.450" style="s2">have a you know with the with the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.010" end="01:31:23.670" style="s2">networks and they&#39;re kind of physical</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.450" end="01:31:25.590" style="s2">disconnection you&#39;re losing voices</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.670" end="01:31:26.850" style="s2">you&#39;re losing you&#39;re losing perspective</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.590" end="01:31:28.230" style="s2">you&#39;re losing people that would actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.850" end="01:31:30.900" style="s2">be able to contribute and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.230" end="01:31:32.550" style="s2">disappearing so you&#39;re you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.900" end="01:31:35.540" style="s2">know if it was soft band so that you</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.550" end="01:31:37.680" style="s2">know that the information and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.540" end="01:31:40.080" style="s2">contributors to the decision-making</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.680" end="01:31:41.310" style="s2">process are even being heard or that you</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.080" end="01:31:43.470" style="s2">are being heard as part of that</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.310" end="01:31:46.140" style="s2">decision-making process right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.470" end="01:31:48.540" style="s2">wiping out coherent so you know in this</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.140" end="01:31:51.240" style="s2">this warfare on on all three you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.540" end="01:31:53.430" style="s2">three dimensions I think if we can get</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.240" end="01:31:56.790" style="s2">back to coherence online and back to</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.430" end="01:31:59.670" style="s2">coherence in networks then it&#39;ll be very</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.790" end="01:32:02.730" style="s2">very powerful how to do that is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.670" end="01:32:04.230" style="s2">a big battle well I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.730" end="01:32:05.970" style="s2">the lack of coherence on the other</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.230" end="01:32:07.740" style="s2">person space as I talk to them about</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.970" end="01:32:10.290" style="s2">things which seemed plain as day to me</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.740" end="01:32:11.940" style="s2">facts which seem real to me I explained</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.290" end="01:32:13.650" style="s2">them in a very orderly and methodical</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.940" end="01:32:15.060" style="s2">fashion and they look at me like I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.650" end="01:32:16.470" style="s2">insane person they don&#39;t trust what I</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.060" end="01:32:18.000" style="s2">said they don&#39;t trust the framework and</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.470" end="01:32:19.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t trust the data and then they</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.000" end="01:32:20.970" style="s2">just completely disregard it I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.440" end="01:32:23.790" style="s2">think you could write it on a personal</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.970" end="01:32:26.700" style="s2">level oh oh yeah you better match my</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.790" end="01:32:29.970" style="s2">fear as is from what you just described</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.700" end="01:32:34.230" style="s2">was that big tech is actually working</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.970" end="01:32:36.600" style="s2">against coherence deliberately yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.230" end="01:32:38.880" style="s2">I think so seems like it they&#39;re cutting</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.600" end="01:32:40.800" style="s2">off nodes hiding information squashing</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.880" end="01:32:43.560" style="s2">people sculpting them banning them and</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.800" end="01:32:46.170" style="s2">then using the big a eyes to accelerate</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.560" end="01:32:48.060" style="s2">certain things and and hide other things</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.170" end="01:32:50.240" style="s2">I mean they can really mess with it I</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.060" end="01:32:53.520" style="s2">mean they can they can make us as</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.240" end="01:32:55.170" style="s2">completely incoherent shoes you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.520" end="01:32:56.730" style="s2">look at they took the viral stuff this</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.170" end="01:32:59.139" style="s2">stuff that was like the bombastic</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.730" end="01:33:02.199" style="s2">content and they accelerated</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.139" end="01:33:03.969" style="s2">you know during 2015-16 in order to</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.199" end="01:33:06.520" style="s2">increase the time that people spend</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.969" end="01:33:08.380" style="s2">online half-right keep you do it and yet</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.520" end="01:33:10.030" style="s2">you know with YouTube and you just you</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.380" end="01:33:11.320" style="s2">know you go a little bit in one</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.030" end="01:33:12.699" style="s2">direction and it will take you all the</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.320" end="01:33:14.940" style="s2">way in that direction down the rather</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.699" end="01:33:16.869" style="s2">exact just to keep you and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.940" end="01:33:19.239" style="s2">decreasing coherence because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.869" end="01:33:22.449" style="s2">bringing people in to these extremes and</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.239" end="01:33:24.580" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re building patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.449" end="01:33:26.949" style="s2">ways of thinking that that are</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.580" end="01:33:28.659" style="s2">distrustful of the of other people right</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.949" end="01:33:30.280" style="s2">a really great example I heard about</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.659" end="01:33:32.980" style="s2">that YouTube phenomenon is like you</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.280" end="01:33:34.570" style="s2">search for a video on how to walk and in</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.980" end="01:33:37.000" style="s2">like three weeks you&#39;re watching videos</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.570" end="01:33:38.860" style="s2">on how to do extreme marathons it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.000" end="01:33:40.270" style="s2">right they just suck you down and push</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.860" end="01:33:43.300" style="s2">you all the way to the first extreme</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.270" end="01:33:45.540" style="s2">just to keep you online so I I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.300" end="01:33:47.770" style="s2">that Trump is trying to start a</p>

<p begin="01:33:47.770" end="01:33:51.610" style="s2">we manage AI and what we do within the</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.480" end="01:33:53.380" style="s2">future it seems like that that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.610" end="01:33:56.050" style="s2">grand project I know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.380" end="01:33:59.830" style="s2">that I&#39;m talked to online think that the</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.050" end="01:34:00.969" style="s2">AI is ten thousand times more of a risk</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.830" end="01:34:03.460" style="s2">than anything else that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.969" end="01:34:05.380" style="s2">right now and how we manage that moving</p>
