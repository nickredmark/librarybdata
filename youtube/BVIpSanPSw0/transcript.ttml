<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">contrary to what some commentators say</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">my view is what he meant was that he was</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">was he was subject to the laws of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">cosmos we would call natural law</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">but he he had to obey the laws of nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">but as for the laws of man as for civil</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">social constructs were silly they</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">weren&#39;t to be taken seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">and so he would do very uh taboo very</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">shocking things he would urinate in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">he would allegedly masturbate in public</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">adversaries to sort of make him look bad</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">he would uh eat in places where it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">inappropriate to eat he would insult</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">um just for the sake of trying to wake</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">cynicism was very much a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">lifestyle that directly challenged</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">when zeno encountered cynicism he</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">uh these guys are on to something</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">diogenes cradies these people</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">they&#39;re right that virtue and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">that&#39;s what we should care about</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s important uh our character</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">um our efforts at self-rectification</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">and all the rest of the trappings are</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">kind of nonsensical however</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">adherence you&#39;re not going to persuade a</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">so let&#39;s make a more palatable version</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">of cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">and from that this attempt to make it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">more palatable</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">uh you know to make it the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">that the average citizen</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">might at least take seriously might</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">contemplate might consider</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">from that you get stoicism and um of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">course after xeno</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">you get the the great stoics you get</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">mussonius rufus</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">you get seneca you get epictetus you get</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">marcus and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">and on it goes again hope i didn&#39;t drown</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">on too long but</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the brief history of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">yeah great and so one thing when i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">reading your book</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">that really struck me um as a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">someone who doesn&#39;t i don&#39;t identify as</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">much as a cynic</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">i saw so your summary there you know was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">kind of cynicism as this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">rougher stoicism or the stoicism that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">that is kind of in a pure form that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been made palatable for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">the masses and what i was getting at</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">when i was reading your book was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">i saw a real emphasis on hypocrisy um</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">and an emphasis on maybe social</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">convention</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">making people do things that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">make doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">um i guess if you could expand on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">in your book and how that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">cynicism in your view yeah my my</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">stoicism definitely shades towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">uh diogenes is as as much of a hero to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">me as</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">his epictetus um i i do</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">find there&#39;s something in me i have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">viscerally negative</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">reaction to being told that i i must say</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">is true and is the correct way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">express myself the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">that i should behave in ways that i find</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">to be either</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.200" style="s2">ignoble or just silly or pointless</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.200" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">i&#39;m expected to behave in this fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">other people and their expectations</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">don&#39;t mean a great deal to me um anymore</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">than they did to diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">uh stoicism is sort of a decaffeinated</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">version of of cynicism and uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t uh i don&#39;t really want to be any</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">more decaffeinated than i absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">themselves with mine</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve never in my life said i&#39;m offended</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">uh other than you know to illustrate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what it means so um</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">yeah i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m a cynic</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">cynical stoic or a stoical cynic or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">yeah cool um so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">when i was taking a look at the book</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">it&#39;s structured as you said as like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">journal</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">and so there&#39;s kind of an essay for</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">every day and one thing you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">in the introduction is that it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">process of like sustained attention or</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">um so you&#39;re gonna you know think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">your life think about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">encountering</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">actively and write about it so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">maybe if you could describe that process</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">or what you learned</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">differently in that year or how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">how that year went differently than a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">year that was maybe less reflective</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">right um i think the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">well by the first thing one of the one</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">of the things i realized early on</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">is how often i found myself um</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.839" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">behaving in a particular fashion because</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">of expectations other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">expectations or what i believe their</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">expectations to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">rather than just saying what i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">inclined to say doing what i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">inclined to do um</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">how often i was uh i was presenting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">other people a persona</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">rather than the actual person that is me</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">and i began to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">how often do i do this how often do all</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">of us do this</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">and when you start asking how often do</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">we behave this way and then you watch</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">politicians or you watch celebrities</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">you realize right away that for them</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s virtually</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">24 hours a day certainly every time</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">they&#39;re on camera certainly every time</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">microphone in their face they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">things that they don&#39;t really believe to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.880" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">or they&#39;re saying things they believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">but they&#39;re saying them in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">unnatural very stilted very</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">artificial and you realize it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">people who are on tv</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">um it&#39;s just about everybody i mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:18.839" style="s2">we&#39;re all constantly censoring ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.839" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">constantly um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">sort of governing governing what we say</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">and do in ways i</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">i think are not particularly healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">certainly are not</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">necessary um or at least i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">no one has convinced me that they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">now you know i&#39;m not suggesting that all</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">um all forms of manners all forms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">behavioral norms are to be jettisoned or</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to go to a funeral and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">start shouting curses</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">or insulting the dead person i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">gonna do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">um there are things there are terms we</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">should not use because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">always only been used in uh indefensible</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">there are a lot there are you know um</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">expressions of that nature but not</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">nearly as many as we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">uh as we&#39;re being told today there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">just a political correctness in my view</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">has just</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">uh gone utterly insane um</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">far far too many the speech police are</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">everywhere and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">are far too influential for my tastes so</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the first things i notice</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">is geez i&#39;m awfully guarded</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">and i&#39;m i think i&#39;m probably a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">guarded than most people are and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.519" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">notice how guarded i am</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">i started to wonder about how how much</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">we&#39;re just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">pretending to each other how much we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">you know pretending to be people that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">really aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">and what would be the advice for getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">rid of the persona</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">or beginning to like engage in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">being less guarded or more truthful</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">i would say you have to start with</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">really brutal</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">brutally honest introspection</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">when you are when you are watching what</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">you say when you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">behaving as someone else wants you to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">behave you&#39;re typically aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">sometimes we gloss over that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">our experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">where we&#39;re focused on others and on</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">what uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">we think they want to hear from us but</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">if you if you take a moment either when</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">or after it has happened to intro</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">respect and ask wait</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">was that me that i was presenting to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">this other person or was that just the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">decaffeinated version of myself the more</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">palatable</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">version of myself that i was presenting</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:39.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how often most people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.839" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">brutally honest</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">with that kind of introspection brutally</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">honest with their assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">who they really are um we are after all</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">we are a species of talking ape right</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">i mean we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">descended from uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">murderers and rapists and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">people who survived long enough to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">procreate back before there were laws</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">and i suspect that surviving long enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">to procreate was largely a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">doing doing things that are uh for very</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">good reason anathema today</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re descended from beasts we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">descended from scavengers we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">descended from</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:24.240" style="s2">a predatory uh predatory set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.240" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">we can&#39;t possibly be as pristine as we</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">often make ourselves out</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">to be today at least i know i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:38.959" style="s2">so yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">and then so there&#39;s this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.959" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">beginning with radical</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">honesty and and introspection um</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">and so one thing you say in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">introduction is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">the the author i&#39;m paraphrasing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">like the author of this book has</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">yeah you know if you relate to the book</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">you probably have problems too</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">right um or relate entirely at least and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">so i guess is part of that process</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">also looking at the parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">you don&#39;t like or where is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">where do you build that up with like</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">self-improvement or like pumping</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">yourself up versus</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">well it&#39;s difficult to improve oneself</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">if you will not be honest about your</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">flaws and your backup</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">pillows and the places where you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">improvement right and uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">that line in the introduction was semi</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek but but only semi uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">i i do have problems i do need help um</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">i am sometimes an obnoxious jerk uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">i am sometimes needlessly abrasive um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">and that does come out in the book i i</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">don&#39;t want to conceal myself from my</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">reader</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">so there are lots of entries in the book</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">in which i</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">take myself to task i say you know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">a pathetic weakling you were today</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">occasion on which i i let an injury</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">if you think about how pathetic that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">when you look at the common lot</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">i&#39;m being pathetic so i call myself on</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">the carpet</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">um repeatedly throughout the year for</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">things like that and other other stupid</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">things just making stupid mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a laudatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">regarding its author it&#39;s not me saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">hey look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">look at how cool i am it&#39;s like it&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">saying look at what a wreck i am are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">anything like me</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:36.080" style="s2">do you need as much help as i do uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the approach um</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.080" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">it reminds me of epictetus but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">kind of like um</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">doing that to yourself and helping along</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">that process</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">um and then i guess i have one more</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">question and then i know peter has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:50.160" style="s2">question so we&#39;ll pass it off to him</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">um i guess the question is how you frame</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">the book so i was reading it i was</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">wondering like</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">is this do you view this as</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">as like arts do you view this as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">self-help book for other people is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">a philosophical project that you engaged</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">in for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">that you then might think inspires or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">helps other people i guess how do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">how do you frame the mod</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">my approach was what i regard as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">approach that marcus aurelius took</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.080" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">writing the meditations</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">then i&#39;m not comparing myself to marcus</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">aurelius he&#39;s a far greater man than me</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">and far</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">wiser just the approach um i&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">down these thoughts in the initial</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">instance in the first instance for my</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">benefit</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">i i&#39;m thinking about myself my flaws</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">various ways i should improve</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">the surrounding circumstances i</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">however uh there are commonalities to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">the human experience we all we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">flawed uh we are all sinners if you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">to use that kind of language we are all</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">uh faced with a world that is very large</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">and powerful and we are frail and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">ephemeral we don&#39;t last very long</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">so if these reflections can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">beneficial to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">me and i believe they were my hope is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">that they might also be beneficial to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">others um anyone from whom i&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">any feedback about the book</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">the feedback has been interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">uniform in one way everyone has said</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">there were times when i was reading this</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">when i laughed out loud there were other</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">times when i was reading this that i</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">found myself</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">giving being the book the finger</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">and there are other times when i found</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">myself not really understanding</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">what the point of this was where i felt</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">kind of lost</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">um and that&#39;s because i</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">sometimes felt kind of lost and i was</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">writing down my thoughts about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">i&#39;m a bit lost here i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">what the wise response to these</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">circumstances is and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to be virtuous in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">particular case um</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">so it&#39;s a self-help book</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:56.840" style="s2">that starts inside here and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">moves um to a more generalizable</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">um perspective</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">great i think i think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">to seeing that process take place too</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">and not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">and also you&#39;re like seems to me you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">have this idea of radical</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">honesty and you don&#39;t want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">pretend like you&#39;re the sage or perfect</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.159" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">so part of it is is this acknowledgment</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">of being lost</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">that that makes a lot of sense to me um</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">i guess i&#39;ll start pass it on to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">chat room so we can get a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">going so peter did you want to start us</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">yeah uh so i have uh i have actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">three questions maybe i&#39;ll just ask</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">one or two um so i&#39;ve been journaling to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">myself every day since kovit came online</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been doing it like maybe 150</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">days now as people</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">still know and i found it uh is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">transformational and i&#39;ve been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">publicly too so i&#39;ve been like just</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">releasing on my mailing list and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">based off marcus aurelius&#39;s journaling</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">um so it&#39;s to myself technically but i</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">people are going to read this right away</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">like the night when i when i release it</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">and so there&#39;s that dynamic of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">of impression management that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">bubbling up all the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">and then kind of the what is really for</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">or at least what at the pretense of its</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">forwards to kind of that self-reflection</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">so i wonder how you wrestled with that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re writing it i&#39;m assuming</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">knowing you were going to release this</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">as a book</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting the the first one</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">i wrote my second book but the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">book of this nature i wrote was this one</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">meditations on self discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">failure stoic exercise mental fitness</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">this one i did not know i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">release</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.200" style="s2">i was just doing what marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">did i was just</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">um writing the journal for my own</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">benefit</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">um i have an anxiety and depression</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">disorder that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">apparently inherited from my dad so i</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">often struggle with those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">challenges and i i found that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">you know bibliotherapy or journaling was</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">effective technique for getting my mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">back under control</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">but after a while i realized i bet there</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">are a lot of people who who might</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">benefit from this i bet there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">of people who face these same challenges</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">and uh because i was reading it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:10.400" style="s2">myself i wrote in second person</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">right everything says you did the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.400" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">following today and you made this</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">um so and i&#39;ve i&#39;ve maintained that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">practice with every book except for</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">this one the only one that&#39;s not written</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">in second person is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">alive for living this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">collection</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">of articles that i&#39;ve published in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">academic journals over the past 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">and i did some research on that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">found out that most academic articles</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">are read by grand total of seven people</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">what&#39;s the point i decided to go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">and put them into a form that was more</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">accessible</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">because i write in second person i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">some readers</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">are a little bit um they find it a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">little bit abrasive</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">especially when i&#39;m criticizing myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">if i say if i write something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">you pathetic weakling here&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">did today</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">well when you&#39;re reading that when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">read the words you pathetic weakling you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">say what me you&#39;re calling me weekly no</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">i&#39;m calling me a weekly i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">wondering uh if</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">other people might um have the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">of concerns about themselves about their</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">so uh everything i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">is a long winded answer question</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">everything i&#39;ve written over the past</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">has been in the first instance an</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">attempt at</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">self-help literal self-help trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">help this guy right here</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">and i hope it generalizes</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">to be self-help for others as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea i</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">hope i answered your question yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">so i have uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">two more questions i&#39;ll just sneak in</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">both in right now and feel free to field</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">which one resonates more</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">um so we talk a lot here at the store</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">about like an ecology what john ray</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">called oncology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">uh we have like a wisdom gym that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">forming uh so basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">don&#39;t just be relying on one life</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">practice or spiritual practice you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.799" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">to have like a balance of a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">them in your ecology</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">and uh and like as as michael</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">and you know like the modern stoic</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">community there&#39;s no consensus of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">wow the stoics actually practice how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">should practice we all have our own</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">bespoke ecology</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">michael like uses jiu jitsu as a form of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">stoic practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious besides the journaling</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">aspect what is your ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">that&#39;s one question and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">question is about the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">uh because you&#39;re an open trump</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">supporter in california</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">um and as i imagine you get uh um</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">comments here or there oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">and and i would argue you might disagree</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">with this but i argue like across the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">political spectrum people get</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">emotionally triggered</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">especially when they feel like they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">been characterized wrongly</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">so do you when that occurs to you those</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">cultural dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">how do you internally emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">respond to it okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">uh the first part of your question is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">about other story practices besides</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">journaling besides writing uh i engage</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">in the uh the practice of pre-meditation</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">malorum that is consider all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">sort of worst case scenarios all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">unpleasant or disastrous possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">that could befall you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">so for example back when i was driving</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">feeling when you talk about like how</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">much harder</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">it is for just any other person than it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">is for</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">for you you know whoever you are and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:58.320" style="s2">in that moment i get that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">like oh yeah like there&#39;s a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.320" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">perspective that goes along with that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">feel like more energetic i feel less</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">bogged down by being stuck in my head</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:08.320" style="s2">but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:09.760" style="s2">when i&#39;m on my own and i hear myself say</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.320" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">those things like you&#39;re a pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.760" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">weakling</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">i i do not get the same shift in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">perspective i feel more weighed down</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">i feel like it&#39;s like mere self-abuse</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">giving me that shift in perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">would make it constructive</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">and so i wonder if you have any advice</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.320" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">for for somebody who would like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">that shift in perspective but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">isn&#39;t finding that the tools are</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">delivering that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">absolutely and in the beginning i had</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">the same problem it just felt like</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">self-abuse it really was just self-abuse</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">it was you&#39;re pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">you&#39;re stupid you&#39;re weak you&#39;re a loser</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">if that&#39;s where it stops</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">that is just self-abuse and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">going to suffer if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">if it if it motivates states change</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">so you can actually be proud of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">or feel better about yourself for having</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">overcome</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">one of your frailties one of your flaws</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">instead of saying you&#39;re pathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">weak say hold on</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">you&#39;re being pathetic and weak right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:07.920" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">right why don&#39;t you try this alternative</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.920" end="00:37:10.880" style="s2">here&#39;s a simple example</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">um i was cleaning up the garage a couple</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">weeks ago and i</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">to pick up this box</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">and it was bulky and heavy and i went to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">pick it up and i got this shooting pain</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">right down the middle of my back</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">so i put it down uh it was kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">involuntary i kind of dropped it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">and i thought well this has to get done</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:35.119" style="s2">my wife is</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">five feet tall and she wasn&#39;t there at</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">look you&#39;re being a wimp you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">weak</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t let yourself be convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">move this box you can move this box you</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">um but when you talk about i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">cynical side of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">you know um what what came off as like</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">to hell with conventions and norms</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:54.079" style="s2">and all that i&#39;m wondering you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">this is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.079" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">i&#39;m sitting with in general like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">the the balance between the individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">and their</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">personal pursuit of personal development</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:09.040" style="s2">and and how we kind of form</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">a healthy society in general and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">wondering</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">how if everyone just issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">social norms or um</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">you know not all uh rules or guidelines</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">that are in place are there to control</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">some are there out of wisdom like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">know millions of years or</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">thousands of years of wisdom that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">of been passed on through cultures</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering how you know how would</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">you design</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">a healthy society incorporating your</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">philosophy and approach but still</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2">you know and i guess not to throw too</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.640" style="s2">much into your your</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">uh put words in your mouth but like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">know how would you create a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">in light of um having that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">uh aversion to social norms</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">right before i answer your question has</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">anyone ever told you that you look a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">like greg jackson</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">one of the top mma trainers at jackson</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">winkle johnny trained jon jones and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this really cool you know he</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">used to train gsp back when gsp was</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">there&#39;s this really cool really stoic</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.960" style="s2">slash cynic moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">where gsp was fighting josh kashak and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">he comes back to his corner</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">and he says i think i tore my abductor</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">and greg jackson looks at me says oh so</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">you want to quit and give up the title</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">and jsp looks hard if i said no he said</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">then don&#39;t tell me about it again i want</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">to hear about it</p>

<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">you know a better society</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">i am not convinced i have no idea how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">no idea i&#39;m not convinced that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">done given</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">uh current circumstances especially</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">i tend to think in the first instance</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">about the united states i live here</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">330 million people it&#39;s not clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">that we even agree about the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">fundamental values anymore</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">um we have become balkanized sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">morally balkanized we have become</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">ideologically balkanized</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">i am not optimistic about</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">perhaps it can be done i am betting on</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to say collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">dissolution um</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">reaction to trump election 2016. you see</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">weeping wailing gnashing their teeth and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.440" style="s2">throwing bricks through windows</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">obviously we have riots going on in</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.440" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">every major city in the nation right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">um if that&#39;s a manifestation of concern</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">socio-political issues i say maybe be</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">less concerned</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">um work on yourself work on</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">conducting yourself in virtuous fashion</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">now clearly if everyone did that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">we would have a a better nation but</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">you see the idea that everyone&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">to do that or even a majority is going</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">is not plausible in my view</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">so i don&#39;t worry about um those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">broad scale issues</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">right so my my brief answer how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">this i have no idea and i</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">doubt it can be done that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">honest answer it&#39;s not satisfying but</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">i&#39;m accustomed to leaving people</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">unsatisfied i&#39;m married you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">if i saw it that way i&#39;d probably vote</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.079" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">for trump too</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">so do you have kids or are you thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">of having kids is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">i have three stepchildren so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">that would be the way i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">i&#39;d transfer the question like how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">you you know raise them even in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">household where they have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">live and coexist together um where do</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">you find that like just be independent</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">and do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">versus no i&#39;m i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">okay i&#39;m sorry i would never say do</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">whatever you want um not if whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">want me is acting on impulse in an art</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">you know our best deal instincts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not being virtuous i encourage my</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">to um develop their intellect i</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:30.480" style="s2">encourage them to develop</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">uh the various virtues to be courageous</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.480" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">uh self-disciplined or temperate to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">just to be fair dealing with others and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">with themselves to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">i think honesty um is one of the um</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">one of the sort of central concerns that</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">is either falling into disfavors being</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">radically misunderstood these days</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">so i always encourage my children to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">morally decent persons um</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.119" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">none of my kids could possibly ever get</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">the impression that i think it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">for them to steal or i think it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">for them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">mistreat a woman or that it&#39;s okay for</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">mistreat a weaker person</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">or that it&#39;s okay to you know lie for</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">some kind of material benefit</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">um so i i advise people to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">conduct themselves in virtuous fashion</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">uh myself included</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">as for expecting others to do so</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a losing it&#39;s a losing</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">you can&#39;t expect the public at large to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">be virtuous it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">the best my knowledge never happened so</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t expect it</p>

<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">why this question is so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">so as aesthetic and realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">the human species has been here however</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">long and has gone through way</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">more tumultuous times than this are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">a trump supporter</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">like to kind of be a heel</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">to attract negative fives</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">no not at all um i i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">understand most of the complaints about</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">trump i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">see the evidence for some of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">complaints um</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">maybe i have a blind spot maybe i just i</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">just don&#39;t perceive the alleged problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">i mean look i understand he&#39;s boorish</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">i understand if you look at the totality</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">of his life you know he&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.559" end="00:47:49.119" style="s2">certainly an adulterer he&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.119" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">you know probably engaged in dirty</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">business deals it&#39;s hard to become a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">billionaire without you know cutting</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">corners here and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">but i just don&#39;t see the man as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">monster that some people make him out to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">um my primary look i i supported trump</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:07.280" style="s2">for two</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">fundamental reasons one is hillary</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.280" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">clinton and the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">i i share no values with him nothing</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">none um secondly i regarded him as the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">much more pro-life</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">candidate which is an important issue to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">me i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">we should encourage um</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t even think we should allow but</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">much less encourage the slaughter of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">unborn human beings in the womb</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">and i knew he was close to being</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">pro-life than she would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">appoint supreme court justices that were</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">more pro-life</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">and would hopefully eventually overturn</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">ludicrous decision that his roe v wade</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">and finally</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">i am concerned about uh immigration</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">restrictionism and as soon as you say</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">that people say ah</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">racism i don&#39;t care where they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.319" style="s2">from i don&#39;t care where i don&#39;t care if</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">immigrants are coming from</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.319" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">you know uh asia africa</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">europe i don&#39;t care to come from canada</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve got 330 million people</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">it is impossible in my view to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:12.160" style="s2">a cohesive culture where we all</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">share a sort of rudimentary set of base</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.160" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.559" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">values if we have no criteria about</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">whom we allow in um</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">i i think there&#39;s this there&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">globalist cosmopolitan idea that if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">cross a border you take an oath</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">you become uh interchangeable with any</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">all right here&#39;s a simple analogy as far</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">as i&#39;ve never heard anyone complain</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:40.000" style="s2">about the amish</p>

<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">us living with them but they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">us living with them</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:48.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t blame them right the amish</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want me</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.720" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">moving into their community because i</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">don&#39;t share their values i don&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">their traditions i don&#39;t share their</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">history i&#39;m not quote one of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">and i probably can&#39;t learn to become one</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">maybe i could but probably not</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">if you have a community of say a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:05.440" style="s2">thousand amish people</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">and a hundred people like me move in</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.440" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">that community&#39;s been destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">it will never be what it once was now</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">if you find what it once was to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">objectionable you might say well good</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t have been that way</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">but i can understand why the amish want</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:20.640" style="s2">to be separate they want they want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">a community of people who understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">i think on a broader scale it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">to maintain the health of the nation if</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a community of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">who in some fundamental underlying</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">fashion understand one each other one</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">another and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">share some basic facets of a world view</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:45.280" style="s2">and just can&#39;t maintain that with open</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">borders or de facto open doors in my</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.280" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">view it can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">um and well uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">i point to the current situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">has at least partial inductive evidence</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">in support of my view</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">um it&#39;s chaos out there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">people are literally shooting each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">literally at each other&#39;s throats</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">um well so i&#39;ll add to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2">so you said trump will win in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">landslide and yeah i don&#39;t have a dog in</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">either fight because</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">i&#39;m a bit more cynical than you even but</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">uh you said he&#39;d win in a landslide but</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">you still think that the country</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">itself won&#39;t exist in 50 60 years so</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">even if</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">your views come to fruition</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">does it just delay things</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">right i i think i think at most it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">delays</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">the the slide the collapse the uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">the slouching toward gamora it delays it</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2">by maybe i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">a couple of years i think we&#39;re doomed</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.000" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">either way</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">so if biden were elected it sooner</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">but yet doomed the question is who will</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">take us to hell at a slightly slower</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">rate of speed</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">i think trump gets us to hell a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">bit later than biden gets us there but</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">we&#39;re going to help if you look around</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">you say why am i in this hand basket</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed um i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">think there&#39;s any way to stop it i hope</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">um i also don&#39;t really have a dog in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">fight like if i&#39;m wrong if trump loses</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to weep well and hash my</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">teeth i&#39;m not going to go throw bricks</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">through windows</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">i&#39;ll just say oh i guess i misread that</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:24.800" style="s2">um i i&#39;m not i try not to be emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">invested</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.800" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">in the outcome of an election because i</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:31.760" style="s2">have no power i live in california</p>

<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">that are not</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">plausibly malleable or subject to our</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">even our influence much less our control</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:56.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m not gonna worry about it but um</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a preferred indifferent for me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.319" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">trump wins rather than biden it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">the culture at large</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">whose lives i see trump lying more out</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">of a sense of self-aggrandizement</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">trump is he&#39;s very thin skinned he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:25.160" style="s2">some ways kind of immature</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:28.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t perceive him lying about</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.160" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">broad-scale issues that actually affect</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.319" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">the health and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">of the nation right now you might</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">as a as an example of the country you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">might say well he lied about covet</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">i i would say he he&#39;s he tried</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:46.559" style="s2">to avoid panic about covet in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">process of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.559" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">yeah he did not exactly tell the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">truth but</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">better for him to say okay listen</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a plague on our hands</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">according to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">initial cdc estimates this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:02.720" style="s2">probably going to kill two to three</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:14.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t believe that&#39;s wise leadership</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.240" end="00:55:18.720" style="s2">i i don&#39;t mind the way he handled it</p>
