<p begin="00:00:01.360" end="00:00:06.850" style="s2">well I have a question I guess I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.660" end="00:00:09.730" style="s2">to know a little bit more about why you</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.850" end="00:00:15.180" style="s2">specifically chose the title the master</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.730" end="00:00:17.529" style="s2">and the emissary yeah that that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.180" end="00:00:19.680" style="s2">meterics plain what I believe to be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.529" end="00:00:21.789" style="s2">relationship is Union hemispheres and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.680" end="00:00:25.119" style="s2">they like most other things in life</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.789" end="00:00:29.380" style="s2">they&#39;re in equal and asymmetrical and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.119" end="00:00:31.869" style="s2">that one of the brain hemispheres sees</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.380" end="00:00:33.910" style="s2">more than the other that is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.869" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve designated the most it mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.910" end="00:00:37.810" style="s2">it was the right hemisphere mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a weird inversion because people</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.810" end="00:00:41.110" style="s2">often think of the left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:42.820" style="s2">the one that&#39;s like dominant they do</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.110" end="00:00:47.620" style="s2">they do traditionally that&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.820" end="00:00:50.440" style="s2">case but as is becoming ever clearer the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.620" end="00:00:52.840" style="s2">right hemisphere this has been a real</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.440" end="00:00:55.630" style="s2">steep learning curve for some people but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.840" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">the variety emma sphere is in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.630" end="00:01:01.270" style="s2">more reliable sees more understands more</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:03.220" style="s2">than the left hemisphere is like a sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.270" end="00:01:05.229" style="s2">of hybrid high functioning bureaucrat in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.220" end="00:01:07.480" style="s2">a way mm-hmm and the idea of the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.229" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">was simply that certain matters needed</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.480" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">to be delegated not only because as it</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.750" style="s2">were the master couldn&#39;t do everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:16.750" style="s2">he needed an emissary to go abroad and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.750" end="00:01:19.090" style="s2">do some of it but also that he must not</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.750" end="00:01:20.920" style="s2">get involved with a certain point of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.090" end="00:01:24.640" style="s2">view otherwise he&#39;d lose what it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.920" end="00:01:25.930" style="s2">that he did to see so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.640" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">really saying there is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.930" end="00:01:30.370" style="s2">good reason why</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:32.140" style="s2">evolutionarily speaking the two brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.370" end="00:01:35.409" style="s2">hemispheres are separate and when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.140" end="00:01:38.500" style="s2">say doesn&#39;t get involved what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.409" end="00:01:44.710" style="s2">advantage of that that detachment from</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.500" end="00:01:46.510" style="s2">the involvement well it&#39;s it rimoni</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.710" end="00:01:49.060" style="s2">cahal you who you know is a great</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.510" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">history ologist yeah and one of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.060" end="00:01:53.560" style="s2">findings was in primates are more</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:56.140" style="s2">inhibitory in neurons than in any other</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.560" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">animals and there are more in humans and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.140" end="00:02:01.479" style="s2">than in any other primate and there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.400" style="s2">many and that&#39;s proposed speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.479" end="00:02:05.799" style="s2">proportionally proportionately and there</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.400" end="00:02:08.770" style="s2">are more kinds as well so we think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.799" end="00:02:12.530" style="s2">about 25% of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.770" end="00:02:16.100" style="s2">cortex is is inhibitory right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.530" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">very strong effect and the corpus</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.100" end="00:02:21.980" style="s2">callosum seems to be very largely in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:24.380" style="s2">end inhibiting function in the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.980" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">hemisphere and that is I think because</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.380" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">over time the two hemispheres have had</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.820" style="s2">to specialize there are reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:34.130" style="s2">actually it can&#39;t be I&#39;m not going to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:35.750" style="s2">into now but I was talking about just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.130" end="00:02:39.290" style="s2">few days ago that the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.750" end="00:02:41.090" style="s2">psychiatry meeting but there are reasons</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.290" end="00:02:43.820" style="s2">why the corpus callosum has had to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.090" end="00:02:45.620" style="s2">become more selective and to inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.820" end="00:02:48.110" style="s2">quite a lot of what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.620" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">other hemisphere because it enables the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.110" end="00:02:53.180" style="s2">two to do distinct things mhm and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:54.860" style="s2">course they have to work together but</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.180" end="00:02:56.420" style="s2">usually good teamwork doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.860" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">everyone trying to do the same role</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.420" end="00:03:00.770" style="s2">right so differentiation is very</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:03.560" style="s2">important for two elements to work</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.770" end="00:03:06.530" style="s2">together and inhibition is one way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.560" end="00:03:08.150" style="s2">doing that so effectively the two takes</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.530" end="00:03:10.990" style="s2">on the world if you like that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">hemispheres have are not easily</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.990" end="00:03:16.520" style="s2">compatible right and we&#39;re not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:18.380" style="s2">that because at a level below</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.520" end="00:03:20.840" style="s2">consciousness there&#39;s a meta control</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.380" end="00:03:23.300" style="s2">center that is bringing them together so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.840" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">in ordinary experience we don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.300" end="00:03:26.300" style="s2">we&#39;re in two different worlds but</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:28.100" style="s2">effectively we are and they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.300" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">different qualities and different goals</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.100" end="00:03:33.800" style="s2">different values different different</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:37.010" style="s2">takes on what is important in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.800" end="00:03:39.080" style="s2">world and what meeting or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.010" end="00:03:41.720" style="s2">let me let me ask you about I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.080" end="00:03:43.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve developed a conceptual scheme for</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.720" end="00:03:45.350" style="s2">for thinking about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.190" end="00:03:46.940" style="s2">between the two hemispheres and I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.350" end="00:03:48.740" style="s2">of I&#39;ve been curious about what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.940" end="00:03:52.130" style="s2">think about it and how it might map on</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.740" end="00:03:53.870" style="s2">to or not your your ideas so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.130" end="00:03:56.360" style="s2">really interested in the orienting</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.870" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">reflex and discovered by so club I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.360" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">back in about 1962 right he was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:04.430" style="s2">student of Laureus and the orienting</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:06.050" style="s2">reflex is manifested when something at</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.430" end="00:04:08.390" style="s2">least in their terminology something</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.050" end="00:04:10.100" style="s2">unpredictable happened i&#39;ve thought much</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.390" end="00:04:12.709" style="s2">more recently than it&#39;s actually when</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.100" end="00:04:16.130" style="s2">something undesired happened happens and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.709" end="00:04:17.210" style="s2">the laboratory constraints obscured that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.130" end="00:04:20.870" style="s2">and that turned out to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.210" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">important but good um so and i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.870" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">put together the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:25.400" style="s2">the orang ting reflex with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:27.050" style="s2">things I learned from Jung Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.400" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">observations on the function of art and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.050" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">dreams so imagine that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:33.010" style="s2">conceptual scheme laid out right we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.300" style="s2">could say that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.010" end="00:04:37.490" style="s2">linguistically media its enforced on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.300" end="00:04:40.100" style="s2">world and then there are exceptions to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.490" end="00:04:43.070" style="s2">that to that conceptual scheme those are</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.100" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">anomalies that are unexpected and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.070" end="00:04:46.850" style="s2">orienting reflex Orient&#39;s you towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">those yes and so those are things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.850" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">aren&#39;t fading property in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:51.770" style="s2">conceptual scheme that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.210" end="00:04:54.290" style="s2">figure out you know the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.770" end="00:04:56.030" style="s2">do is react defensively essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.290" end="00:04:58.040" style="s2">because it might be dangerous yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.030" end="00:05:00.530" style="s2">then your exploratory systems are</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.040" end="00:05:02.300" style="s2">activated yes so and the exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.530" end="00:05:03.950" style="s2">systems first of all our enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.300" end="00:05:05.870" style="s2">attention from an attentional</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.950" end="00:05:08.510" style="s2">perspective but then and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.870" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">the art issue sort of creeps into it</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.510" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:14.810" style="s2">the right hemisphere generates an</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">imaginative landscape of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.810" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">that could map that anomaly so you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:20.750" style="s2">kind of experience that it&#39;s at night</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:21.950" style="s2">you know like say you&#39;re sitting alone</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.750" end="00:05:24.200" style="s2">at night it&#39;s 2:00 or 3:00 in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.950" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">morning you&#39;re kind of tired maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.200" end="00:05:27.050" style="s2">you&#39;re in an unfamiliar place and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a noise that happens that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.050" end="00:05:31.760" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t happen in another room yep you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.250" style="s2">can play with that so for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.760" end="00:05:36.170" style="s2">open the door slightly and put your hand</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.250" end="00:05:38.150" style="s2">in to turn on the light and you watch</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.170" end="00:05:40.070" style="s2">what happens your mind will fill with</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.150" end="00:05:42.020" style="s2">imaginative representations of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.070" end="00:05:46.220" style="s2">might be a route is right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.020" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">the the the landscape of anomaly will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.220" end="00:05:49.580" style="s2">populated with something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:51.920" style="s2">imaginative demons yes and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.580" end="00:05:53.180" style="s2">first pass approximation and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.920" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">me that that&#39;s a right hemispheric</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.180" end="00:05:58.550" style="s2">function and then that as you explore</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:06:01.040" style="s2">further that imaginative domain which</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.550" end="00:06:02.540" style="s2">which circumscribes what might be is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.040" end="00:06:03.890" style="s2">restrained and constrained and</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.410" style="s2">specialized and realized it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:11.240" style="s2">like that yeah does that seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.410" end="00:06:15.980" style="s2">reasonable what do you think about that</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.830" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">well I mean of course we are not lizards</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.740" end="00:06:52.620" style="s2">or toads or marmoset or whatever but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:55.470" style="s2">animals generally speaking yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.620" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">the case getting in grasping and after</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.470" end="00:06:59.700" style="s2">all our left hemisphere is the one that</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:08.480" style="s2">mentioned yeah is more right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:11.820" style="s2">and when the when a frontal function is</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.920" end="00:07:37.140" style="s2">hemisphere to grasp so when you said</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.220" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">exploratory and you said defense and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.140" end="00:07:41.100" style="s2">said also opening up to possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2">these are all aspects or the way the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.100" end="00:07:45.750" style="s2">right hemisphere I often say the right</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.230" end="00:07:57.290" style="s2">you need chaos an order and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.950" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">I loved in your talk you talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.290" end="00:08:02.340" style="s2">chaos and order but if I may say so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.230" style="s2">seemed and maybe you&#39;d like to gloss</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.340" end="00:08:05.940" style="s2">that a little you seem to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.230" end="00:08:07.740" style="s2">it would be good we can&#39;t get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.940" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">chaos but you&#39;ve seemed to imply that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.740" end="00:08:12.900" style="s2">would be better if we could whereas my</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.960" end="00:08:15.060" style="s2">view is that chaos and order are</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.900" end="00:08:19.830" style="s2">necessary to one another and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.060" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">proper sort of harmony balance okay I</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.830" end="00:08:24.270" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s as deep a question</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:26.760" style="s2">as you could possibly ask I would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.270" end="00:08:28.500" style="s2">because I&#39;m saying some of them I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.760" end="00:08:31.470" style="s2">say there&#39;s a central theological issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.500" end="00:08:34.110" style="s2">there and yes you there&#39;s the you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.470" end="00:08:36.030" style="s2">in Genesis the proper environment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.110" end="00:08:37.979" style="s2">humanity is construed as a garden yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.030" end="00:08:40.400" style="s2">and so I see that as the optimal balance</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.979" end="00:08:42.630" style="s2">of chaos and order nice nature is</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.400" end="00:08:43.170" style="s2">flourish isn&#39;t it prolific and is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.630" end="00:08:45.470" style="s2">chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.170" end="00:08:46.940" style="s2">yeah then if you add harmony to that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.470" end="00:08:48.860" style="s2">garden yes where you live in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.940" end="00:08:50.360" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to tend the garden okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.860" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">so now the garden is created it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.360" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">walled space yes even as a walled space</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:56.270" style="s2">yeah Ferriday side so it&#39;s a walled</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.470" end="00:08:58.700" style="s2">garden that&#39;s it now the thing is as</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.270" end="00:09:01.070" style="s2">soon as you make a wall you try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.700" end="00:09:02.360" style="s2">what&#39;s outside out but you can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.070" end="00:09:03.830" style="s2">the boundaries between things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.360" end="00:09:05.510" style="s2">permeable so if you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.830" end="00:09:06.890" style="s2">reality and you&#39;re gonna have a bounded</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:07.730" style="s2">space you&#39;re gonna have a snake in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.890" end="00:09:09.500" style="s2">garden yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.730" end="00:09:11.300" style="s2">now then the question is what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.500" end="00:09:13.550" style="s2">should you do about that make the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.300" end="00:09:16.460" style="s2">walls so high that no snake can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.550" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">get in or should or should you allow for</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.460" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">the possibility of snakes but make</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:21.740" style="s2">yourself strong enough so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">contend with them and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.740" end="00:09:25.910" style="s2">there&#39;s an answer there that goes deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">to the question of even maybe why the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.910" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">theological question of why God allowed</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:32.090" style="s2">evil to exist in the world I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.720" end="00:09:35.690" style="s2">you it&#39;s like well do you make people</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.090" end="00:09:38.090" style="s2">safe or strong and strong is better and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.690" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">safe might not be commensurate with</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.090" end="00:09:43.670" style="s2">being like it might not be possible to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.070" end="00:09:45.410" style="s2">exist and to be safe well our existence</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.670" end="00:09:47.450" style="s2">is predicated on the fact that we dies</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.410" end="00:09:50.840" style="s2">well what&#39;s never safe well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.450" end="00:09:53.240" style="s2">certainly bounded yeah this inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.840" end="00:09:55.460" style="s2">wrapped up with you sort of finitude</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.240" end="00:09:57.890" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s this there&#39;s a lovely</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.460" end="00:09:59.300" style="s2">lovely Jewish idea and ancient ideas one</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.890" end="00:10:01.580" style="s2">of the most profound ideas I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.300" end="00:10:05.630" style="s2">come across and so it&#39;s a kind of a Zen</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.580" end="00:10:07.280" style="s2">koan and here it is is that so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.630" end="00:10:09.410" style="s2">question about the classic attributes of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.280" end="00:10:11.930" style="s2">God omniscient omnipresent and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.410" end="00:10:14.900" style="s2">omnipotent hmm what is it being with</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.930" end="00:10:15.980" style="s2">those three attributes Locke mm-hmm what</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.900" end="00:10:18.860" style="s2">kind of question is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.980" end="00:10:20.270" style="s2">the answer is limitation yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.860" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">second answer is that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.270" end="00:10:25.250" style="s2">justification for being is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.490" end="00:10:27.800" style="s2">unlimited lacks the limited exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.250" end="00:10:29.660" style="s2">so because a limited is us for anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.800" end="00:10:32.450" style="s2">to come into existence there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.660" end="00:10:35.450" style="s2">an element of resistance and so things</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.450" end="00:10:37.280" style="s2">are never predicated on one pole of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.450" end="00:10:43.370" style="s2">is always a dipole right</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.280" end="00:10:47.180" style="s2">everything is has that type oh yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.370" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s imaged in the yin-yang idea but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.180" end="00:10:50.990" style="s2">it seems to me very important because in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.820" style="s2">our culture we often seem to suppose</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.990" end="00:10:54.710" style="s2">that certain things are just good and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.820" end="00:10:56.030" style="s2">other things are just bad and it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.710" end="00:10:58.040" style="s2">good if we could get rid of the bad ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.030" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">but actually by pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.040" end="00:11:02.310" style="s2">certain good things that are good within</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">measure too far they become bad not so</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.310" end="00:11:07.320" style="s2">cool right but now let&#39;s go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:08.670" style="s2">a normally thing because Ramachandran</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.320" end="00:11:11.520" style="s2">calls the right hemisphere the unnormal</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.670" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">yes yes and so I think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.520" end="00:11:15.390" style="s2">very important point because there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">two ways you can react to an anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.390" end="00:11:20.940" style="s2">one is to and both have to be explored</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">one is to try and prove that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.940" end="00:11:24.510" style="s2">really an anomaly and therefore you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:26.760" style="s2">carry on with things as normal</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.510" end="00:11:28.590" style="s2">yes and the other is hopeful that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.760" end="00:11:30.300" style="s2">you hope that that&#39;s it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.590" end="00:11:31.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the typical left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.300" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">approach doesn&#39;t want anything to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:36.180" style="s2">to shift yeah and quite reasonably you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.320" end="00:11:37.740" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be chaotically shifting if</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.180" end="00:11:40.500" style="s2">you&#39;re onto a good thing too stressful</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.740" end="00:11:45.270" style="s2">exactly it takes too much work it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:47.670" style="s2">you might actually be mistaken in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.270" end="00:11:49.980" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly correct to be wary but</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.670" end="00:11:51.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not correct to be so wary that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.980" end="00:11:53.730" style="s2">blot out anomalies and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.840" end="00:11:55.650" style="s2">evidence as I&#39;m sure you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.730" end="00:11:57.660" style="s2">left hemisphere simply blocks out</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.650" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">everything that doesn&#39;t fit with its</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.660" end="00:12:02.640" style="s2">take it doesn&#39;t see it acting at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:04.050" style="s2">right so it&#39;s there&#39;s a hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.640" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">element in the right hemisphere going</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.050" end="00:12:07.620" style="s2">hang on but there may be another way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:10.380" style="s2">thinking that will accommodate this</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.620" end="00:12:12.630" style="s2">better and actually good science needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.380" end="00:12:15.000" style="s2">yes to be skeptical about anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.630" end="00:12:17.670" style="s2">otherwise the be chaos it also needs to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.000" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">be able to shift when an anomaly is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.670" end="00:12:21.510" style="s2">rightly large enough right right or</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:22.950" style="s2">there is quite a lot of them and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.510" end="00:12:25.410" style="s2">don&#39;t really fit very well into this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.950" end="00:12:27.030" style="s2">exactly yes yes so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.410" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">another observation that Jung made which</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.030" end="00:12:30.810" style="s2">I loved I love this observation he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:33.210" style="s2">trying to account for radical</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.810" end="00:12:34.920" style="s2">personality transformation right and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.210" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">his idea was this and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.920" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s commensurate with the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:41.060" style="s2">inhibition between the two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:43.230" style="s2">so let&#39;s imagine the left is habitually</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.060" end="00:12:44.850" style="s2">inhibiting the function of the right to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.230" end="00:12:47.580" style="s2">keep fear under control it does that all</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.850" end="00:12:51.180" style="s2">sorts of ways but so imagine that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.580" end="00:12:53.700" style="s2">right is reacting to anomalies and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.180" end="00:12:54.780" style="s2">aggregating them okay the left can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.700" end="00:12:56.580" style="s2">deal with them so the right is</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.780" end="00:12:57.840" style="s2">aggregating anomalies and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.580" end="00:12:59.730" style="s2">starting to manifest itself and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.840" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">nightmarish dreams for examples like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.730" end="00:13:03.470" style="s2">that these normally sir piling up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:06.180" style="s2">indication that you&#39;re on shifting sand</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.470" end="00:13:07.860" style="s2">well so then imagine that the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.180" end="00:13:09.510" style="s2">hemisphere aggregates anomalies and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.860" end="00:13:10.830" style="s2">it starts to detect patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.510" end="00:13:11.260" style="s2">anomalies and so now it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.830" end="00:13:13.000" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.260" end="00:13:15.400" style="s2">what you might consider a counter</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.000" end="00:13:17.710" style="s2">hypothesis and the left psychosis if</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.400" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">that counter hypothesis gets to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.710" end="00:13:23.260" style="s2">point where the total sum in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:25.540" style="s2">of the anomalies plus the already mapped</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.260" end="00:13:27.940" style="s2">territory can be mapped by that new</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.540" end="00:13:29.950" style="s2">pattern then at some point it will shift</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.940" end="00:13:32.530" style="s2">yes and the person will kick into a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.950" end="00:13:35.050" style="s2">yes now it&#39;s like a piagetian stage</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.530" end="00:13:38.440" style="s2">transition except more dramatic it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.050" end="00:13:43.140" style="s2">and what a fusion stage transition is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.440" end="00:13:47.260" style="s2">also like and subsumes those is regalian</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.140" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">Alf fable the idea that a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.260" end="00:13:51.550" style="s2">opposed by something else</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:53.620" style="s2">but when it when there is a synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.550" end="00:13:56.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not that one of them is annihilated</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.620" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">right there both transformed and taken</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.290" end="00:14:00.310" style="s2">up into the new hole which embraces what</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:02.950" style="s2">before looks like look like an</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.310" end="00:14:06.130" style="s2">opposition okay so here&#39;s a question for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.950" end="00:14:07.720" style="s2">you you know when I read Thomas Kuhn I</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.130" end="00:14:09.400" style="s2">was reading to a PSA at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.720" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">and I knew that PSA was aware of codes</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.400" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">work by the way and the problem I had</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.280" style="s2">with cone and the interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:18.580" style="s2">interpreters of Kuhn is they don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.280" end="00:14:20.380" style="s2">to get something who interpret Kuhn has</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.580" end="00:14:22.890" style="s2">a moral relativist in some sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.380" end="00:14:27.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t seem to get the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.890" end="00:14:29.740" style="s2">increased generalizability of a plan so</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.400" end="00:14:31.330" style="s2">let&#39;s say I have a theory and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.740" end="00:14:33.010" style="s2">anomalies accrue and I have to wipe out</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.330" end="00:14:34.840" style="s2">the theory and so then I wipe out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.010" end="00:14:36.130" style="s2">theory and I incorporate the anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.840" end="00:14:38.020" style="s2">and now I have another theories yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.130" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a descent into chaos that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.020" end="00:14:43.480" style="s2">estimation okay old story so the anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.230" end="00:14:46.180" style="s2">yeah disruption is the mythical descent</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.480" end="00:14:48.370" style="s2">into chaos yes and then you reconfigure</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.180" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">the theory with the chaos and you come</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.370" end="00:14:52.930" style="s2">up with a better theory yes okay the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:54.430" style="s2">reservoir is it better and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.930" end="00:14:56.020" style="s2">what accounts for everything that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.430" end="00:14:57.670" style="s2">previous theory accounted for plus the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.020" end="00:14:59.320" style="s2">anomaly exactly so there&#39;s progress</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.670" end="00:15:01.660" style="s2">always yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.320" end="00:15:03.160" style="s2">but Kuhn is often read as stating that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.660" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">there is no progress that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.160" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">there&#39;s incommensurate paradigms and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:08.530" style="s2">had a just shift between them but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:10.540" style="s2">there isn&#39;t there is a cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.530" end="00:15:12.370" style="s2">knowledge in some sense well I think one</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:15.790" style="s2">thing that when we probably would both</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.370" end="00:15:19.990" style="s2">agree about is that we don&#39;t buy as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.790" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">story that you know because nothing can</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.990" end="00:15:24.710" style="s2">be demonstrated definitively utterly to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.260" style="s2">be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.710" end="00:15:29.510" style="s2">there is no truth I mean I think we both</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.260" end="00:15:31.339" style="s2">believe that there are truths things</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.510" end="00:15:33.980" style="s2">that are truer than other things and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.339" end="00:15:36.470" style="s2">indeed if the actor well we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.980" end="00:15:39.200" style="s2">even talk correctly if we did exam and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.470" end="00:15:41.270" style="s2">even to say that there are no truths is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.200" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">itself a truth statement which is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.270" end="00:15:45.200" style="s2">truer than the statement there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:47.480" style="s2">truths so everybody automatically has</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.200" end="00:15:49.550" style="s2">choose whether they know it or not yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.480" end="00:15:51.230" style="s2">because while you and you said why I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.550" end="00:15:54.410" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s not only that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.230" end="00:15:55.339" style="s2">talk you can&#39;t even see no because you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.410" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to point you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.339" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">know how to discriminate what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:03.980" style="s2">into your brain so it&#39;s inevitable and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:06.110" style="s2">think we would agree about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.980" end="00:16:08.660" style="s2">think that may be a slight point of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.110" end="00:16:12.860" style="s2">difference between us in that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.660" end="00:16:16.279" style="s2">willing to embrace the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.860" end="00:16:18.350" style="s2">uncertainty and Isis I may be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.279" end="00:16:20.930" style="s2">perhaps you could expand on that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.350" end="00:16:24.050" style="s2">sometimes you come across as as a man</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.930" end="00:16:26.420" style="s2">who has certainties this well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.050" end="00:16:28.220" style="s2">peculiar kind of certainty I&#39;m certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.420" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">that standing on the border between</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.220" end="00:16:34.459" style="s2">order and chaos is a good idea that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:36.200" style="s2">weird exactly because that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.459" end="00:16:39.850" style="s2">be in this sort of slightly unstable</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.200" end="00:16:42.709" style="s2">position yes you have to you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.850" end="00:16:44.510" style="s2">what would you say encountering as much</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.709" end="00:16:46.279" style="s2">uncertainty as you can voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.510" end="00:16:47.779" style="s2">tolerate yes I think that&#39;s equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.279" end="00:16:50.330" style="s2">to vygotsky&#39;s zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.779" end="00:16:51.770" style="s2">development I&#39;m sorry so when we talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.330" end="00:16:53.630" style="s2">a little bit earlier about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.770" end="00:16:56.200" style="s2">an instinct for meaning yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.630" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">what meaning is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:17:01.370" style="s2">elaborated form of the orienting reflex</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:02.900" style="s2">but what meaning does its function its</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.370" end="00:17:04.699" style="s2">biological function which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.900" end="00:17:07.400" style="s2">more real in some sense than any other</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.699" end="00:17:08.929" style="s2">biological function is to tell you when</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.400" end="00:17:11.150" style="s2">you&#39;re in the place where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.929" end="00:17:13.010" style="s2">balanced the stability let&#39;s say of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.150" end="00:17:15.530" style="s2">left hemisphere systems with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.010" end="00:17:17.449" style="s2">exploratory capacity of your right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.530" end="00:17:19.910" style="s2">that not only are you master of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.449" end="00:17:21.980" style="s2">domain but you&#39;re expanding that domain</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.910" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">simultaneous it and when you I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.980" end="00:17:26.179" style="s2">that when you&#39;re there yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:28.010" style="s2">a it&#39;s a kind of a metaphysical place in</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.179" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">some sense that you&#39;re imbued with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.010" end="00:17:31.010" style="s2">sense of meaning and purpose and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:33.590" style="s2">an indication that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.010" end="00:17:35.780" style="s2">optimized your neurological function yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.590" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">and the perhaps we could gloss the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.780" end="00:17:41.990" style="s2">of purpose because I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">a difference between people get very</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.990" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">confused I think about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:51.410" style="s2">purpose particularly whether there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:54.230" style="s2">problem that suggesting there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.410" end="00:17:56.780" style="s2">purpose and I believe there is a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.230" end="00:18:01.310" style="s2">or there are purposes to the cosmos not</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.780" end="00:18:03.590" style="s2">just to my and suggest that somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.310" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">all been predetermined by God but this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.590" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">is to misunderstand the nature of time</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:09.470" style="s2">that there are time static slices and</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.880" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">unfurl is extremely boring and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.520" end="00:18:21.500" style="s2">and an entirely static and non creative</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.110" end="00:18:29.300" style="s2">overall a direction but actually exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:31.790" style="s2">what that direction is isn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.300" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">it looks like and it&#39;s a fool who says</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.790" end="00:18:36.980" style="s2">anything positive about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">God but but I&#39;m not convinced that God</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.980" end="00:18:41.330" style="s2">is omniscient and omnipotent either I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.380" end="00:18:44.750" style="s2">think God is in the process of is</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.750" end="00:18:50.060" style="s2">but is becoming epidemic yeah so being</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:52.730" style="s2">and becoming more becoming I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.060" end="00:18:54.710" style="s2">becoming is the important thing why do</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.730" end="00:18:57.020" style="s2">you think that I mean it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.710" end="00:18:58.490" style="s2">strange segue I mean I&#39;m not criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">but I&#39;m curious what what drove you to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.490" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">that conclusion an awful lot of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:07.580" style="s2">really and I think that everything is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:12.740" style="s2">a process in fact I&#39;m writing a book</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.580" end="00:19:15.620" style="s2">called there are no things oh there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.740" end="00:19:17.690" style="s2">processes yes and there are patterns</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.620" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">patterns yes well I think music is so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.690" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">powerful music is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:23.690" style="s2">mysterious and wonderful things in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:25.850" style="s2">universe and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.690" end="00:19:31.640" style="s2">foolish of people to have thought that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.850" end="00:19:33.500" style="s2">the you know planetary motions were kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.640" end="00:19:35.450" style="s2">of music I think it is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.500" end="00:19:36.980" style="s2">insight now the music you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.450" end="00:19:38.360" style="s2">thought and I&#39;ve said this in public</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.980" end="00:19:40.520" style="s2">lectures that music is the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.360" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">representative of the Arts it is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.520" end="00:19:45.680" style="s2">world&#39;s music describes how those</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:47.210" style="s2">patterns should be arranged you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.680" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">representative in a very different way</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.210" end="00:19:51.730" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:53.620" style="s2">depends on what you mean by represent so</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.730" end="00:19:55.690" style="s2">it&#39;s representing the ultimate reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.620" end="00:19:57.550" style="s2">of the cosmos what I would like to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.690" end="00:19:59.650" style="s2">that presentative inner that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.550" end="00:20:01.870" style="s2">representing anything it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.650" end="00:20:03.580" style="s2">when we&#39;re in the presence of music</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.870" end="00:20:06.760" style="s2">something is coming into being which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:09.640" style="s2">which is at the core of the whole cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.760" end="00:20:13.480" style="s2">process and I think that&#39;s what love</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.640" end="00:20:15.220" style="s2">music they do and I mean I&#39;m hardly any</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.480" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">originality in the idea cause lots of</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.530" end="00:20:25.570" style="s2">of planets and so forth are more like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.500" end="00:20:28.900" style="s2">dance or more like music than they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.570" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">like things bumping into it right and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.900" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">a lot of things there&#39;s patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:35.559" style="s2">people have made into tools I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:37.179" style="s2">you and tools of what the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.559" end="00:20:38.590" style="s2">hemisphere is always looking for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.179" end="00:20:42.460" style="s2">always like insanity didn&#39;t pass right</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.590" end="00:20:44.350" style="s2">it rare phase processes that if you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.460" end="00:20:46.330" style="s2">all a matter of time every single thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.350" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">including the mountain behind my house</p>

<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:57.610" style="s2">as it were a series of like a time-lapse</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.270" end="00:21:00.780" style="s2">camera you&#39;d see the thing morphing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.610" end="00:21:03.460" style="s2">changing and flowing everything flows as</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.780" end="00:21:05.170" style="s2">Heraclitus once said everything flows</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.460" end="00:21:07.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just a question of over the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.170" end="00:21:10.150" style="s2">period that you consider it temple it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.210" end="00:21:12.429" style="s2">a question of the tenure and so taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.150" end="00:21:14.710" style="s2">time out of things and considering them</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.429" end="00:21:16.420" style="s2">in the abstract deracinated from context</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.710" end="00:21:18.100" style="s2">particularly from the flow and from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.420" end="00:21:21.040" style="s2">context of time changes them into</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.100" end="00:21:23.380" style="s2">something else and I think that what in</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.040" end="00:21:24.910" style="s2">brief what Plato has done and what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.380" end="00:21:27.929" style="s2">of the history of more recent</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.910" end="00:21:32.110" style="s2">Christianity has done is to thing if I</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.929" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">God and heaven perfect states that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.110" end="00:21:39.300" style="s2">unaltered and so on and I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">is an ever evermore wonderfully self</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.300" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">self exploring self actualizing process</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:50.110" style="s2">that requires a degree of opposition you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:53.080" style="s2">know as a stream in order to have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.110" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">movement and the and the ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.080" end="00:22:01.180" style="s2">patterns in it that when I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.080" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to describe these experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.180" end="00:22:06.040" style="s2">but when I&#39;ve contemplated death deeply</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.940" end="00:22:08.200" style="s2">it has struck me as a as a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.040" end="00:22:10.030" style="s2">repair mechanism like it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:11.680" style="s2">mechanism by which new things that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.030" end="00:22:13.150" style="s2">better are brought in to be absolute and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.680" end="00:22:15.220" style="s2">I mean you see that in your own being</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.150" end="00:22:17.290" style="s2">yes of course without death you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.220" end="00:22:18.910" style="s2">live yes because you&#39;re dying the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.290" end="00:22:20.470" style="s2">about you that aren&#39;t right even though</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.910" end="00:22:22.650" style="s2">the physiological level are dying all</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.470" end="00:22:25.780" style="s2">the time they are unfortunately you also</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.650" end="00:22:28.540" style="s2">completely die which is unfortunate side</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.780" end="00:22:31.180" style="s2">but more more cosmically speaking it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:34.750" style="s2">does seem to me that death is the is its</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.180" end="00:22:36.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t know man it&#39;s I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.750" end="00:22:39.310" style="s2">intuitions or intimations the death is</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.820" end="00:22:40.810" style="s2">the friend of being and that&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.310" end="00:22:42.550" style="s2">hard to get my head around that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.810" end="00:22:45.670" style="s2">completely agree with you and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.550" end="00:22:53.320" style="s2">that&#39;s been said by many many many ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.670" end="00:22:55.750" style="s2">of people than myself I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.320" end="00:22:59.080" style="s2">right that death is predicated on life</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.750" end="00:23:03.220" style="s2">but also is it it shouldn&#39;t be seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.080" end="00:23:06.340" style="s2">sort of something that&#39;s negative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.220" end="00:23:10.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a necessary stage in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.340" end="00:23:12.190" style="s2">being becoming what it is and since</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.450" end="00:23:14.110" style="s2">everything is ramified since nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.190" end="00:23:15.940" style="s2">just isolated you and i may look as</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.110" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">though feel as though but as you often</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.940" end="00:23:25.330" style="s2">eloquently say we all have in time we</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.120" end="00:23:27.190" style="s2">come from a place but also as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.330" end="00:23:29.290" style="s2">we have history we can&#39;t detach</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.190" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">ourselves from it we&#39;re expressions of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.290" end="00:23:34.540" style="s2">it but we&#39;re also inevitably dependent</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.070" style="s2">as all organisms are on the environment</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.540" end="00:23:38.110" style="s2">where I end and where the great</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.070" end="00:23:39.670" style="s2">environment begins is a I didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.110" end="00:23:41.740" style="s2">the word environment it&#39;s not a nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.670" end="00:23:43.180" style="s2">it&#39;s just something that&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.740" end="00:23:44.740" style="s2">born whereas environments there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.180" end="00:23:47.260" style="s2">something around me from which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.740" end="00:23:50.710" style="s2">separate but but anyway all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.260" end="00:23:53.260" style="s2">close to yes yes so I would see us as</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.710" end="00:23:55.000" style="s2">like an eddy in a stream or like a wave</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.260" end="00:23:57.730" style="s2">in the sea that is never set for</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.970" end="00:24:14.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s getting bigger and is you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.090" end="00:24:15.270" style="s2">all the time I&#39;m writing it I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.560" end="00:24:17.640" style="s2">more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.270" end="00:24:21.110" style="s2">things that I am really must get to know</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.640" end="00:24:23.490" style="s2">more about and it&#39;s an ever receding</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.110" end="00:24:26.010" style="s2">well it&#39;s a danger of a book that I know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.490" end="00:24:27.900" style="s2">that aims at something fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.010" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">because I never run you never hit the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.900" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">proper boundaries that&#39;s it I need that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.910" end="00:24:36.300" style="s2">wool mhm yes yeah well I also had</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.480" end="00:24:38.070" style="s2">experiences I would say that when I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.300" end="00:24:39.330" style="s2">trying to understand their imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.070" end="00:24:41.070" style="s2">experiences when I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.330" end="00:24:43.590" style="s2">understand let&#39;s say the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.070" end="00:24:45.780" style="s2">evil hmm no because that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.590" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">fundamental theological conundrum and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.780" end="00:24:50.100" style="s2">yeah a metaphysical conundrum you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:52.170" style="s2">why is it that being is constituted such</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.100" end="00:24:55.730" style="s2">that evil is allowed to exist and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.170" end="00:24:58.920" style="s2">even chromosomes what critique of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.730" end="00:25:00.660" style="s2">Alyosha&#39;s christianity essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.920" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">kind of God would allow for this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.660" end="00:25:04.020" style="s2">thing that&#39;s the ancient question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:06.600" style="s2">it&#39;s an ancient question and I mean part</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.020" end="00:25:08.220" style="s2">of what I thought but I mean I thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.600" end="00:25:09.390" style="s2">about the adversarial I went to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.220" end="00:25:12.510" style="s2">which is that you need a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.390" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">because you don&#39;t you&#39;re not forced to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.510" end="00:25:16.140" style="s2">bring forth what you could bring forth</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:17.370" style="s2">without a challenge and the greater the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.140" end="00:25:18.810" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re supposed to bring</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.370" end="00:25:21.000" style="s2">forth the greater the challenge has to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.810" end="00:25:22.710" style="s2">be yeah I need an adversary something</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.000" end="00:25:27.300" style="s2">like that but then I also thought that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.710" end="00:25:29.670" style="s2">um it would it&#39;s possible that that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.300" end="00:25:31.860" style="s2">being being requires limitation you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.670" end="00:25:33.390" style="s2">might say optimal being requires free</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.860" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">choice I know I&#39;m going through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.390" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">things quickly free choice requires the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:40.470" style="s2">real distinction between good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:42.030" style="s2">is that you don&#39;t have choice well so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.470" end="00:25:44.310" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s possible to set up a world</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.030" end="00:25:45.960" style="s2">where evil is a possibility but where it</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.310" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that has to be manifest</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.960" end="00:25:49.800" style="s2">you know where it&#39;s an option open to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.660" style="s2">you and a real option and it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.800" end="00:25:53.430" style="s2">and the challenge that was presented to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.660" end="00:25:56.340" style="s2">you but it&#39;s something that you can not</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.430" end="00:25:58.980" style="s2">you can not move towards if you soul if</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.340" end="00:26:00.360" style="s2">you so desire and that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.980" end="00:26:02.250" style="s2">something like the ethical ethical</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.360" end="00:26:04.890" style="s2">requirement that that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.250" end="00:26:06.060" style="s2">ethical requirement to avoid evil I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.890" end="00:26:08.790" style="s2">sure doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.060" end="00:26:13.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not the same issue there it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.790" end="00:26:16.680" style="s2">it isn&#39;t and I wonder what could recast</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.080" end="00:26:20.010" style="s2">it as the need for other nurse and God</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.680" end="00:26:21.570" style="s2">needs something other and that other if</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.010" end="00:26:23.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be just part of God</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.570" end="00:26:26.160" style="s2">has got to be free otherwise there will</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.670" end="00:26:27.340" style="s2">be no creation I mean the the nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.160" end="00:26:33.090" style="s2">that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.340" end="00:26:36.610" style="s2">other than than God it may in the end</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.090" end="00:26:39.159" style="s2">come from and come back to right that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.610" end="00:26:41.559" style="s2">God well with that divine essence all</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.159" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">that whatever but there&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.559" end="00:26:45.190" style="s2">thing I can&#39;t figure out either like in</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:47.740" style="s2">the Christian idea there&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.190" end="00:26:49.210" style="s2">time where the the evil is separated</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.740" end="00:26:51.820" style="s2">from God from yeah and I think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.210" end="00:26:55.480" style="s2">that as a metaphysical well you might</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.820" end="00:26:57.970" style="s2">think if it&#39;s a form of like imagines</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.480" end="00:27:00.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a form of perfection a form of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.970" end="00:27:02.409" style="s2">striving for perfection you fragment</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.070" end="00:27:04.539" style="s2">yourself yes you challenge yourself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.409" end="00:27:06.490" style="s2">throw what&#39;s not worthy into the fire</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.539" end="00:27:08.470" style="s2">elastic something like that and so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.490" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">it what you end up with retained is much</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.470" end="00:27:11.440" style="s2">better than what you started with</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:12.789" style="s2">through the trials something like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.440" end="00:27:14.769" style="s2">well that sounds a bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.789" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">dialectical process that we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.769" end="00:27:23.559" style="s2">it right and you have alluded to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:28.629" style="s2">couple of very good Jewish myths and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.559" end="00:27:30.100" style="s2">there&#39;s one in the lurin Kabbalah about</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.629" end="00:27:32.740" style="s2">the creation which I don&#39;t if you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.100" end="00:27:35.710" style="s2">it but it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely riveting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.740" end="00:27:39.190" style="s2">me and the idea is that the primary</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.710" end="00:27:46.360" style="s2">being aims off the ground of all being</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.190" end="00:27:49.450" style="s2">and needs something other to come into</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.360" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">being the creation and that creation</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.450" end="00:27:54.669" style="s2">what does that aims off do was his first</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:57.429" style="s2">act is it to stretch out a hand and make</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.669" end="00:28:00.369" style="s2">something not a big the first act is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.429" end="00:28:02.619" style="s2">withdraw to create a place in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.369" end="00:28:06.129" style="s2">there can be something other than paint</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.619" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">off and so the first stage is called sim</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.129" end="00:28:11.830" style="s2">summon is sounds- as so many creative</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:15.190" style="s2">things do with draw and then in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.830" end="00:28:17.529" style="s2">space there are vessels and a spark</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.190" end="00:28:19.749" style="s2">comes out of aims off and falls into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.529" end="00:28:25.480" style="s2">vessels and they all shatter and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.749" end="00:28:28.690" style="s2">called sefirot okay yes you right yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.480" end="00:28:32.350" style="s2">and then there is the third stage repair</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.690" end="00:28:35.289" style="s2">in which what has just been fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.350" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">is restored into something greater and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.289" end="00:28:40.340" style="s2">so this process carries on and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:41.690" style="s2">my terms very like what happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.340" end="00:28:43.930" style="s2">with the hemispheres the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.690" end="00:28:46.790" style="s2">hemisphere is the one that is first</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.930" end="00:28:49.340" style="s2">accepting it is sort of actively</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.790" end="00:28:50.870" style="s2">receptive if you can put it that way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.340" end="00:28:54.140" style="s2">whatever is new you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.870" end="00:28:56.170" style="s2">Hammond gobo cancer and and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.140" end="00:28:58.370" style="s2">whatever that is is then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.170" end="00:29:00.500" style="s2">processed by the left hemisphere at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.370" end="00:29:03.650" style="s2">next stage in two categories so it&#39;s bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.500" end="00:29:05.150" style="s2">of that yeah try to understand it but of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.650" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">course whatever it is is much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.150" end="00:29:09.500" style="s2">than any of the categories so they all</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:12.470" style="s2">break down and it gets restored in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.500" end="00:29:16.370" style="s2">right hemisphere into a new hole that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.470" end="00:29:18.740" style="s2">the tikkun the repair mm-hmm right tik</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.370" end="00:29:23.030" style="s2">kuf tik right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.740" end="00:29:25.370" style="s2">and I think that the the kind of easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.030" end="00:29:26.600" style="s2">way of thinking about it is learning a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.370" end="00:29:28.280" style="s2">piece of music you&#39;ll first of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.600" end="00:29:30.260" style="s2">attracted to it as a whole you then</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.280" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">realize that you need to practice that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.260" end="00:29:35.780" style="s2">piece of bar 28 and you realize that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">know it 64 there&#39;s a return to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.780" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">dominant or something and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:43.640" style="s2">when you go on stage you&#39;ve got to just</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.170" style="s2">forget all about that but it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.640" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">that work was lost it&#39;s just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.170" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">no longer present right right</p>
