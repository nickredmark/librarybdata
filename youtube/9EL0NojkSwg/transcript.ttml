<p begin="00:00:05.509" end="00:00:12.870" style="s2">so it&#39;s probably about 8 months since we</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">spoke before we did a talk just before</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.870" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">Jordan Peterson South Paris at their</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">very high profile discussions and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">talked about how to argue to the 90s it</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:26.210" style="s2">certainly seems to me that there&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:29.300" style="s2">of a shift whereas before the Atheist</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.210" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">worldview was sort of quite cynical</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.300" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">religious people are idiots at believing</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:36.510" style="s2">what they believe was dominant</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">whereas now I&#39;ve seen a bit of shit it</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.510" end="00:00:40.200" style="s2">sort of seems that now the atheists of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">the ones that look a little bit naive</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.200" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">because they&#39;re rejecting a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:45.710" style="s2">of the world&#39;s knowledge they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">rejecting mythology and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.710" end="00:00:51.629" style="s2">partly related at least to the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">interest in Jordan Pederson what do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.629" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">make of that well I first was aware of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:01:03.059" style="s2">shift actually rather earlier in 2013</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">when my TED talk was so-called banned</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.059" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">you may remember there was a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">controversy I gave a TEDx talk on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">Suns solution and then Ted took it down</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">following protests from militant</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">atheists peas ed Myers and Jerry Coyne</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">who attacked Ed they didn&#39;t argue with</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">what I&#39;d said they just said what I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">was pseudoscience and Ted had destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">their credibility by allowing me to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">there I&#39;m familiar that&#39;s with that kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:31.350" style="s2">of attack usually people don&#39;t argue</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">with what I say they attack the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">who provide the platform so that then</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">led to a persistent controversy which</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:42.780" style="s2">was very embarrassing for Ted and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">start with the sort of atheist troll</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">types dominated but there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">backlash and gradually the whole tone of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">the debate shifted until they became a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">kind of minority and that talk which</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">they of course couldn&#39;t ban you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:02.060" style="s2">ban anything on the internet anymore has</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">now had well over 5 million views and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.060" end="00:02:07.380" style="s2">the majority of comments you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.020" style="s2">supportive most people can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.380" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">why this talk should be banned or why</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.020" end="00:02:15.090" style="s2">even should be controversial I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">scientific questions so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.090" end="00:02:22.580" style="s2">time I saw the shift myself before that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">anything by me was instantly attacked by</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.580" end="00:02:30.330" style="s2">the kind of atheist you know the troll</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">types his that is a huge paradox because</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:34.799" style="s2">in that all the science was he called</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">the science division as well you were</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.799" end="00:02:38.430" style="s2">saying there are certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to say because of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.430" end="00:02:44.549" style="s2">dogma of science and the dog with his</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:46.709" style="s2">science materialists then came down and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.549" end="00:02:47.819" style="s2">said basically prove your point we</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.709" end="00:02:49.590" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.819" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">I mean it was ironic I mean they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.590" end="00:02:57.269" style="s2">get it themselves the the irony of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">but that&#39;s what happened and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.269" end="00:03:02.579" style="s2">the first sign of a turning point was</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">then and I think it&#39;s accelerated this</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.579" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">process and I think Jordan Peters has</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:09.019" style="s2">done a great deal to accelerate it</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:13.019" style="s2">actually and there is something about</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.019" end="00:03:16.739" style="s2">the nature of this have bottom-up sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.019" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">making of the Internet is bypassing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.739" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">lot of the gatekeepers now the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:23.549" style="s2">who have already made up their minds</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">about you for example yes the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.549" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">provides a an open forum</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">for good or ill I mean all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:33.139" style="s2">crazy people can get their views out on</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:33.139" style="s2">the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s for me it&#39;s been very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">because because I&#39;m a kind of proclaimed</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:42.060" style="s2">heretic in the world of science I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:46.859" style="s2">it&#39;s not me that proclaims that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.060" end="00:03:48.569" style="s2">sort of branded as a heretic then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.859" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">normal gatekeepers and the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.569" end="00:03:52.709" style="s2">media rather back off when it&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">to do with me because it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.709" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">controversial it&#39;s not that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">afraid of the views I&#39;m putting forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid of people criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">them for allowing these views to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:10.109" style="s2">expressed and you&#39;ve indicated yet or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:11.700" style="s2">are you is that some way off yet well</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.109" end="00:04:12.770" style="s2">the point I was making in the science</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">delusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.770" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">ten dogmas of science that I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:20.750" style="s2">about the changes that have happened in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:23.170" style="s2">science since it came out have all gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.750" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">in the direction I was suggesting and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.170" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">the one weather the greatest change has</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:30.200" style="s2">happened is in the chapter 11 of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">book is called illusions of objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.200" end="00:04:36.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s about the way that scientists</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">believe that science is true everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.620" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">else is sort of false but science is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:44.600" style="s2">true because it&#39;s replicable and because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:46.280" style="s2">of peer review and I pointed out in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.600" end="00:04:48.260" style="s2">chapter that the way science is actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.280" end="00:04:50.630" style="s2">practiced the chance of it being</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.260" end="00:04:53.090" style="s2">replicable pretty low people pray to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.630" end="00:04:54.950" style="s2">publish their best results they ignore</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.090" end="00:04:57.920" style="s2">results that don&#39;t fit their theory very</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.950" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">often and indeed many journals won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.920" end="00:05:03.650" style="s2">publish negative results or for that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:05.900" style="s2">matter replications and then due to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">three years later there was this</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.900" end="00:05:09.950" style="s2">enormous thing blew up in science the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:12.710" style="s2">replicability crisis or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.950" end="00:05:15.650" style="s2">reproducibility crisis where it turned</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.710" end="00:05:17.720" style="s2">out that in biomedical sciences up to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.650" end="00:05:21.140" style="s2">90% of publish papers couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.720" end="00:05:24.070" style="s2">replicated in psychology about 60% the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.140" end="00:05:27.380" style="s2">majority of papers in top journals</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.070" end="00:05:29.300" style="s2">turned out not to be replicable and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.380" end="00:05:31.370" style="s2">has caused an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.300" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">soul-searching within science I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.370" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">mood within science that normally I grew</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:38.120" style="s2">up with it being like that is arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.960" end="00:05:40.100" style="s2">you know we know the truth we&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.450" end="00:05:48.170" style="s2">we say is true because it&#39;s replicable</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.100" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s subject to peer review it now</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.170" end="00:05:53.900" style="s2">turns out that a lot of it most of it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:56.570" style="s2">not replicable and it turns out to peer</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.900" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">review processes very badly flawed again</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.750" end="00:11:39.570" style="s2">and parents is a big event and I was</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.570" end="00:11:44.730" style="s2">thought everything was plain sailing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:47.940" style="s2">then the New Republic magazine in</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.730" end="00:11:50.760" style="s2">America published an article by Jerry</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:08.580" style="s2">hoped his readers and he put this online</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:11.370" style="s2">too he said I hope you&#39;ll join me in</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.580" end="00:12:13.800" style="s2">emailing the headmaster of B Dale school</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.800" end="00:12:19.110" style="s2">he put the email address and started a</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.870" end="00:12:29.490" style="s2">thing he&#39;d and and the result was that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.270" end="00:12:31.940" style="s2">the it sold out was in about two days</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.490" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">and they had a wait a long waiting list</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.940" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">but it that&#39;s the standard technique and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:39.060" style="s2">that&#39;s why gatekeepers and media</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:43.320" style="s2">frightened because they get personally</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.060" end="00:12:45.570" style="s2">attacked for for doing this so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.320" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case that many people in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.570" end="00:12:50.650" style="s2">media are converted who converse to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">sort of materialist</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.650" end="00:12:55.720" style="s2">view I mean they do personally believe</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.950" end="00:20:57.040" style="s2">him I did biology because I really liked</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.110" end="00:20:59.470" style="s2">animals and plants and by the time I got</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.040" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">to be an undergraduate where I was at</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.470" end="00:21:04.690" style="s2">Cambridge and I realized that the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:07.810" style="s2">thing you do in biology classes is kill</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.690" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">what you&#39;re studying and and grind it up</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.810" end="00:21:13.960" style="s2">and analyze enzymes and things I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:15.460" style="s2">doing biochemistry at Cambridge and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.960" end="00:21:18.250" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really looking at the things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.460" end="00:21:20.440" style="s2">I found most interesting and for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.250" end="00:21:22.870" style="s2">as a child I kept homing pigeons and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.440" end="00:21:25.780" style="s2">was fascinated I still AM how do pigeons</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.870" end="00:21:27.640" style="s2">home I was no one knows even to this day</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.780" end="00:21:29.860" style="s2">we were never going to find out by</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.640" end="00:21:32.410" style="s2">killing a pigeon and grinding it up and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.860" end="00:21:36.860" style="s2">looking at the enzymes and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.410" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">so I was I just found that the questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.860" end="00:21:41.540" style="s2">I wanted to look at in biology weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:45.700" style="s2">being looked at and it was just in this</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.700" end="00:21:50.809" style="s2">and I wanted to find a more integrative</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.809" end="00:21:56.590" style="s2">undergraduate I discovered the writings</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.429" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">reports and grant proposals they want a</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:06.690" style="s2">who tell them what they&#39;re doing and who</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.899" end="00:28:09.090" style="s2">and with the ability to fund something</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.690" end="00:28:11.010" style="s2">really new and exciting so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.090" end="00:28:13.019" style="s2">that&#39;s one way forward in fact is</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.010" end="00:28:15.779" style="s2">probably the most promising way forward</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.019" end="00:28:17.909" style="s2">the other way forward I think will come</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.779" end="00:28:19.559" style="s2">through a breakdown of the present</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.909" end="00:28:22.019" style="s2">healthcare system which is just too</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.559" end="00:28:24.600" style="s2">expensive and people will be forced to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.019" end="00:28:28.110" style="s2">look for cheaper ways of bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.600" end="00:28:33.320" style="s2">healthcare and most alternative systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.110" end="00:28:36.809" style="s2">are cheaper than high-tech healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.320" end="00:28:45.389" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of going back to a almost kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.809" end="00:28:47.399" style="s2">of Renaissance patronage yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.389" end="00:28:49.559" style="s2">think that&#39;s what well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.399" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">actually it&#39;s already happening I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.559" end="00:28:52.620" style="s2">it&#39;s how is worked for me that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:55.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to function as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.620" end="00:28:58.110" style="s2">scientist since I was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.580" end="00:29:01.260" style="s2">excommunicated by the editor of nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.110" end="00:29:04.019" style="s2">in his famous book for burning editorial</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.260" end="00:29:06.299" style="s2">that he proclaimed me a heretic</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.019" end="00:29:08.279" style="s2">and tried to excommunicate me and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.299" end="00:29:11.940" style="s2">believed that that would be the end of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.279" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">me but it wasn&#39;t because I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.940" end="00:29:15.659" style="s2">been very fortunate to have people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:18.210" style="s2">believed in what I do and who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.659" end="00:29:20.730" style="s2">prepared to fund it and one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.210" end="00:29:22.679" style="s2">helps is the fact that I both as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.730" end="00:29:25.230" style="s2">matter of principle and personal</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.679" end="00:29:27.330" style="s2">disposition I try and design the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.230" end="00:29:29.820" style="s2">simplest possible experiments to get the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.330" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">most effective results with minimum cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.820" end="00:29:36.500" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ve brought up in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:41.880" style="s2">British minimum cost experimental</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.500" end="00:29:44.429" style="s2">tradition so luckily this research isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.880" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">very expensive and actually in general</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.429" end="00:29:48.990" style="s2">holistic research is much cheaper than</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:50.669" style="s2">reductionist research if you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.990" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">very small things like subatomic</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.669" end="00:29:56.520" style="s2">particles you need a 10 billion euro</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:58.679" style="s2">Large Hadron Collider to do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.520" end="00:30:00.690" style="s2">if you&#39;re studying the behavior of Jack</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.679" end="00:30:04.770" style="s2">dolls all you need a binoculars and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.690" end="00:30:07.169" style="s2">clipboard and paper or a computer so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.770" end="00:30:09.750" style="s2">can actually study things more easily if</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.169" end="00:30:12.570" style="s2">you&#39;re working at a holistic level and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.750" end="00:30:15.299" style="s2">your new book is going beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.570" end="00:30:18.120" style="s2">science of spiritual practice do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.299" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">have a sense that and also it&#39;s a sequel</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.120" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">to another book called the science of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.350" end="00:30:25.470" style="s2">spiritual practice is that because</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:28.860" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re seeing that as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.470" end="00:30:30.870" style="s2">window of validating validating</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">spiritual practice as a way in to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.870" end="00:30:36.510" style="s2">materialist world well partly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:38.610" style="s2">what I think&#39;s happening at Memon is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.510" end="00:30:41.460" style="s2">basis of my last two books science and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.610" end="00:30:43.710" style="s2">spiritual practices and ways to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.460" end="00:30:47.429" style="s2">beyond and why they work my most recent</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.710" end="00:30:49.320" style="s2">book is that in each book I discuss</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.429" end="00:30:51.330" style="s2">seven different spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.320" end="00:30:54.870" style="s2">which have been studied scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.330" end="00:30:56.400" style="s2">which have measurable effects because</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.870" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2">this is an area where science and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.400" end="00:31:01.740" style="s2">spirituality are converging it&#39;s not any</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:03.419" style="s2">longer that kind of old standoff sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.740" end="00:31:05.730" style="s2">scientists saying all that stuff&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.419" end="00:31:07.380" style="s2">rubbish is a waste of time it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.730" end="00:31:10.049" style="s2">spiritual view saying you know science</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.380" end="00:31:12.929" style="s2">is just too crass and and and and I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.049" end="00:31:15.240" style="s2">can&#39;t appreciate these things what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.929" end="00:31:17.700" style="s2">happening now is there have been many</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.240" end="00:31:19.740" style="s2">thousands actually of serious scientific</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.700" end="00:31:25.350" style="s2">studies of spiritual practices such as</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.740" end="00:31:28.169" style="s2">meditation which show how they affect</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.350" end="00:31:30.270" style="s2">physiology brain activity different</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.169" end="00:31:31.860" style="s2">regions of the brain health and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.270" end="00:31:33.720" style="s2">well-being generally speaking these</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.860" end="00:31:38.309" style="s2">practices make people happier and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.720" end="00:31:39.900" style="s2">healthier and live longer and so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.309" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">science actually illuminates the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.900" end="00:31:46.230" style="s2">spiritual practice and helps to validate</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.700" end="00:31:48.360" style="s2">it and spiritual practices enable anyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.230" end="00:31:51.000" style="s2">who wants to to explore the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.360" end="00:31:53.520" style="s2">consciousness and its connections with</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.000" end="00:31:55.190" style="s2">more than human realms of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.520" end="00:31:58.200" style="s2">which is what spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.190" end="00:31:59.970" style="s2">traditionally about the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.200" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">not the only conscious beings in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.970" end="00:32:03.929" style="s2">universe and we I mean the normal</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:05.880" style="s2">materialist view is we are the only</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.929" end="00:32:08.160" style="s2">conscious beings apart from animals</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.880" end="00:32:11.160" style="s2">less conscious than us unless there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.160" end="00:32:13.080" style="s2">little green men with similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.160" end="00:32:16.169" style="s2">science and brains to us on other</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.080" end="00:32:18.870" style="s2">planets but all traditional religion is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.169" end="00:32:21.690" style="s2">based on the idea that there&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.870" end="00:32:23.640" style="s2">consciousness is one level of conscience</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.690" end="00:32:27.660" style="s2">but there are levels beyond ours that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.640" end="00:32:29.510" style="s2">are more inclusive much greater and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.660" end="00:32:34.200" style="s2">higher levels of consciousness to which</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.510" end="00:32:36.600" style="s2">we can form the connections and in which</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.200" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">we can participate through spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.600" end="00:32:43.530" style="s2">practices you mentioned before some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:45.210" style="s2">the forces that are stopping change are</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.530" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">we are we looking at some group think</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.210" end="00:32:48.210" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at you think that mostly</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:51.270" style="s2">financial or you think they&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.210" end="00:32:52.919" style="s2">cultural well they&#39;re both I mean most</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.270" end="00:32:55.070" style="s2">people have been to university have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.919" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">pretty well indoctrinated with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.070" end="00:33:01.890" style="s2">materialist Atheist worldview and if</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:03.750" style="s2">they&#39;re going to discover any other</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.890" end="00:33:06.840" style="s2">worldview they have to do it outside the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.750" end="00:33:09.890" style="s2">formal educational framework so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.840" end="00:33:13.409" style="s2">educational system is I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.890" end="00:33:15.630" style="s2">basically a hangover from 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.409" end="00:33:17.880" style="s2">materialism and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.630" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">rationalism which is enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.880" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">rationalism is the idea that science and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:24.659" style="s2">reason are in the got Vanguard of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:27.240" style="s2">humanity religion and spirituality are</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.659" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">just superstitions left over from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.240" end="00:33:32.730" style="s2">Dark Ages and the scientists of the new</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:35.940" style="s2">priesthood and we march forward in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.730" end="00:33:38.490" style="s2">through science and technology to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.940" end="00:33:40.650" style="s2">progress I mean that&#39;s the standard view</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.490" end="00:33:43.380" style="s2">there&#39;s some truth in it of course and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.650" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">we have much better smartphones and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.380" end="00:33:49.049" style="s2">certainly much improved dentistry</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:51.299" style="s2">compared with 50 years ago and there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.049" end="00:33:58.289" style="s2">a major advance in technology all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.299" end="00:34:00.210" style="s2">time but that worldview is underlying</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.289" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2">the educational system in practically</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.210" end="00:34:04.860" style="s2">every country in the world that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:08.220" style="s2">people are educated into and that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.860" end="00:34:11.159" style="s2">think is a major obstacle because it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.220" end="00:34:14.909" style="s2">fills people&#39;s minds with this 19th</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.159" end="00:34:16.380" style="s2">century materialism and in countries</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.909" end="00:34:18.810" style="s2">like India and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.380" end="00:34:20.550" style="s2">in Japan people are educated with this</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.810" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">most some just don&#39;t believe it they</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.550" end="00:34:24.210" style="s2">they believe it when they&#39;re at work or</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:26.280" style="s2">when they&#39;re at school but as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.210" end="00:34:28.860" style="s2">they get home an evening they become</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.280" end="00:34:31.980" style="s2">fairly conventional Hindus Muslims Sikhs</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.860" end="00:34:34.970" style="s2">Jains or whatever I lived in India for</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.980" end="00:34:37.830" style="s2">seven years and very few Indians</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.830" end="00:34:41.610" style="s2">science they do is like that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.750" end="00:34:43.860" style="s2">that they see that as a separate</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.610" end="00:34:45.990" style="s2">compartment separate bit of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.860" end="00:34:48.180" style="s2">those are the rules if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.990" end="00:34:49.830" style="s2">ahead you&#39;ve played by those rules but</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.180" end="00:34:51.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t really believe it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.830" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">believe that&#39;s the ultimate truth</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.779" end="00:37:42.599" style="s2">at all is is theology and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.710" end="00:37:46.469" style="s2">very very interesting work going on in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.599" end="00:37:50.569" style="s2">contemporary theology you see after the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.469" end="00:37:53.009" style="s2">17th century the in in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.569" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">theologians had to adapt to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.009" end="00:37:58.049" style="s2">nature as a machine scientists all had</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:38:00.210" style="s2">to side to nature as a machine and where</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.049" end="00:38:03.210" style="s2">does that leave God it leaves God some</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.210" end="00:38:05.190" style="s2">outside nature possibly creating it in</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.210" end="00:38:08.460" style="s2">the first place like a kind of engineer</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.190" end="00:38:11.489" style="s2">or mathematician a kind of mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.460" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">God who&#39;s like a human engineer making</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.489" end="00:38:15.930" style="s2">machinery and it&#39;s a view that worked</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">quite well for an industrial age where</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.930" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s all about machinery and engineers</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:25.049" style="s2">and mathematicians and engineers are at</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.880" end="00:38:27.210" style="s2">the top of the priesthood as it were but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.049" end="00:38:28.980" style="s2">the medieval view in the Christian West</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.210" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.980" end="00:38:36.370" style="s2">sufism in Islam and in Jewish mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">was that God is permeating nature God is</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.370" end="00:38:41.410" style="s2">in nature and nature is in God that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:43.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not that God separate from nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.410" end="00:38:46.660" style="s2">but every moment the natural world is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.750" end="00:38:49.450" style="s2">sustained by the divine being there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.660" end="00:38:51.700" style="s2">kind of theophany or a revelation of God</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.450" end="00:38:55.170" style="s2">in in plants and in animals and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.700" end="00:38:57.850" style="s2">humans in the heavens and in all nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.170" end="00:39:00.610" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now is there&#39;s a move</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.850" end="00:39:02.020" style="s2">in theology to go back to that mystical</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.610" end="00:39:04.660" style="s2">theology of the Middle Ages and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.020" end="00:39:09.640" style="s2">reconnect with this much more inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.660" end="00:39:11.560" style="s2">view of spirituality and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.640" end="00:39:14.860" style="s2">favorite theologians as someone called</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.560" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">David Bentley Hart har T who wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.860" end="00:39:21.630" style="s2">book called the experience of God being</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:24.790" style="s2">consciousness bliss which shows that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:28.270" style="s2">ultimate conscious reality as conceived</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.790" end="00:39:31.060" style="s2">of in Western Eastern and in other</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.270" end="00:39:33.100" style="s2">traditions has much more in common these</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.060" end="00:39:35.820" style="s2">views than they have that separates them</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.100" end="00:39:38.530" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a threefold model of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:42.940" style="s2">ultimate reality which the Hindus call</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.530" end="00:39:47.620" style="s2">set chit Ananda being the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.940" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">being is conscious yet is the contents</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:56.080" style="s2">kinds of things you think about or</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.120" end="00:39:59.260" style="s2">perceive and Ananda is a joy or bliss</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.080" end="00:40:01.840" style="s2">which comes as part of this ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.260" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">divine consciousness the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.840" end="00:40:06.670" style="s2">version is the Holy Trinity Father Son</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:09.550" style="s2">and Holy Spirit the father&#39;s the ground</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.670" end="00:40:13.510" style="s2">of being the son is the law gas forms</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.550" end="00:40:16.750" style="s2">patterns ideas word and spirit is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.510" end="00:40:19.300" style="s2">moving principle which is also blissful</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.750" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">and I think spiritual practices that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.300" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">involve movement like music and sports</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:28.990" style="s2">tap into this kind of spirit in aspect I</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">think practices like meditation which</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.990" end="00:40:33.750" style="s2">involve going to the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:37.450" style="s2">consciousness and relate to this Sat or</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.750" end="00:40:38.339" style="s2">father aspect the basic aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.450" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">divine</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.339" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">sustaining the universe through</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">form aspect it&#39;s what we appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.359" end="00:40:50.349" style="s2">through beauty the beauty of flowers the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.630" style="s2">beauty of animals the beauty of art the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.349" end="00:40:54.130" style="s2">beauty of architecture so I think these</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.630" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">different practices relate to different</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.130" end="00:41:00.250" style="s2">aspects of ultimate reality and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:02.050" style="s2">as I as I say in my new book ways to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.250" end="00:41:04.990" style="s2">beyond and why they work I think why</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.050" end="00:41:08.589" style="s2">they work is because they relate this</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.990" end="00:41:10.839" style="s2">ultimate conscious being conceived often</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.589" end="00:41:15.460" style="s2">is surprisingly similar way in different</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.839" end="00:41:17.080" style="s2">traditions and even Taoism in Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.460" end="00:41:20.109" style="s2">tradition which starts from completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.080" end="00:41:22.300" style="s2">different philosophical principles is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.109" end="00:41:24.609" style="s2">this is essentially a Trinitarian that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.300" end="00:41:27.369" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the yin and the yang these</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.609" end="00:41:29.230" style="s2">polar principles that interact each has</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.369" end="00:41:31.060" style="s2">a bit of the other within it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.230" end="00:41:33.369" style="s2">constantly interacting in this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.060" end="00:41:35.500" style="s2">polarity but they&#39;re contained within</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.369" end="00:41:38.920" style="s2">the circle there&#39;s the wholeness that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.500" end="00:41:42.060" style="s2">unifies is the ground of both of them so</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.920" end="00:41:44.740" style="s2">that again is a kind of threefold model</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.060" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">and these are any models all these</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.740" end="00:41:50.140" style="s2">traditions say that ultimate reality if</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.450" style="s2">it&#39;s the consciousness of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.140" end="00:41:55.900" style="s2">universe and also transcending it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.450" end="00:41:58.119" style="s2">always bound to be beyond human</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.470" end="00:42:20.670" style="s2">only through a kind of direct mystical</p>

<p begin="00:42:31.720" end="00:42:37.570" style="s2">to Christianity in some in some way I am</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.510" end="00:42:40.630" style="s2">yes I when I was in India when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.570" end="00:42:44.320" style="s2">India Rose still an atheist from my</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.630" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">scientific education but my view of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.320" end="00:42:50.220" style="s2">mind had expanded through taking</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:53.370" style="s2">SD in 1970 or 71 when I first took it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.220" end="00:42:56.010" style="s2">totally changed my view of what mines</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.370" end="00:42:58.920" style="s2">were like then I took out meditation</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.010" end="00:43:00.510" style="s2">transcendental meditation and yoga and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.920" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">so when I first went to India I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.510" end="00:43:05.220" style="s2">primarily interested in Hindu philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:08.790" style="s2">and then I had a Sufi teacher for a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.220" end="00:43:11.010" style="s2">while and then I found myself drawn back</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.790" end="00:43:14.130" style="s2">to my own tradition which I&#39;d rejected</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.010" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">when I was a teenager partly because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.130" end="00:43:20.250" style="s2">my ideas about morphic resonance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:22.380" style="s2">more more natural for me to be in line</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.250" end="00:43:24.840" style="s2">with the whole line of my ancestors and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.380" end="00:43:28.740" style="s2">my traditions my whole culture is shaped</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.840" end="00:43:30.630" style="s2">by that and to amputate it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.740" end="00:43:32.790" style="s2">violation of the whole tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.630" end="00:43:35.310" style="s2">much better to come to terms with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.790" end="00:43:40.130" style="s2">and I thought and so I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.310" end="00:43:43.470" style="s2">confirmed in India at the age of 36 and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.130" end="00:43:45.810" style="s2">then I found a wonderful Christian</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.470" end="00:43:47.910" style="s2">teacher a Benedictine monk who lived in</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.810" end="00:43:50.610" style="s2">an ashram in South India called father</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.910" end="00:43:54.080" style="s2">bead griffiths an English monk who&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.610" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">been in India for more than 25 years and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.080" end="00:43:58.460" style="s2">he for me was the perfect bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:00.870" style="s2">East and West he was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.460" end="00:44:03.720" style="s2">knowledgeable and influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.870" end="00:44:05.490" style="s2">Hindu tradition we did yoga in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.720" end="00:44:11.430" style="s2">ashram we had two hours of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.490" end="00:44:14.070" style="s2">every day and so that was for me a kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.430" end="00:44:18.680" style="s2">of integrative experience since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.070" end="00:44:20.760" style="s2">been back in England I rediscovered the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.680" end="00:44:25.770" style="s2">Anglican tradition in which I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.760" end="00:44:28.740" style="s2">brought up and just came to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.770" end="00:44:30.150" style="s2">in India I&#39;d appreciated the temples and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.740" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">the pilgrimages to them I suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.150" end="00:44:34.080" style="s2">realized we call these unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.510" style="s2">temples here in England the cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.080" end="00:44:38.820" style="s2">you know in astonishing buildings built</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.510" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">to express and expanded consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.820" end="00:44:45.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not functional buildings these</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:47.820" style="s2">vast vaults and soaring structures are</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.120" end="00:44:49.170" style="s2">there to express a kind of altered state</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.820" end="00:44:51.810" style="s2">of consciousness the stained glass</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.170" end="00:44:54.450" style="s2">windows in the Middle Ages when most</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.810" end="00:44:55.880" style="s2">people lived in huts and earrings sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.450" end="00:44:59.450" style="s2">of mud colored</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.880" end="00:45:04.089" style="s2">would have been you know psychedelic I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.450" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">mean they&#39;re still psychedelic the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.089" end="00:45:08.839" style="s2">sacred chanting in these cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:11.480" style="s2">happens every day and choral evensong</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.839" end="00:45:15.320" style="s2">the service sung by incredibly well</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.480" end="00:45:19.010" style="s2">trained in beautiful choirs in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.320" end="00:45:21.230" style="s2">evening all these things have just</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.010" end="00:45:23.300" style="s2">incredible cultural wealth and to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.230" end="00:45:26.530" style="s2">part of it and to be inspired by it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.300" end="00:45:28.310" style="s2">is I found quite wonderful and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.530" end="00:45:31.460" style="s2">rediscovering the tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.310" end="00:45:32.930" style="s2">pilgrimage in England I&#39;m a patron of</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.460" end="00:45:35.660" style="s2">something called British pilgrimage</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.930" end="00:45:38.869" style="s2">trust - we&#39;re reopening the old footpath</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.660" end="00:45:41.210" style="s2">pilgrimage routes to the holy places of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.869" end="00:45:43.460" style="s2">England that again is so just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.210" end="00:45:46.940" style="s2">wonderful way to relate to the land and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.460" end="00:45:50.740" style="s2">to the history and to these ancient holy</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.940" end="00:45:53.750" style="s2">places but in a completely modern way</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.740" end="00:45:55.940" style="s2">the one of the things the pilgrimage</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.750" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">trance does is has apps that work on</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.940" end="00:46:00.040" style="s2">smartphones who can find your way as you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.329" style="s2">walk through the fields and the woods</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.040" end="00:46:04.760" style="s2">you can just do it with your smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.329" end="00:46:10.069" style="s2">now whereas a medieval pilgrim of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.760" end="00:46:11.960" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have had that and I myself make</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.069" end="00:46:14.869" style="s2">a practice of going to church every</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.960" end="00:46:17.960" style="s2">Sunday morning wherever I am which means</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.869" end="00:46:21.380" style="s2">that I relate to the local community to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.960" end="00:46:24.500" style="s2">the local holy place to have a space and</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.380" end="00:46:27.470" style="s2">the week when I can give thanks and pray</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.500" end="00:46:29.480" style="s2">and sing with other people if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.470" end="00:46:33.170" style="s2">get to church I don&#39;t have a space to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.480" end="00:46:36.890" style="s2">just other things crowd in the 24/7</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.170" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">cultural crowd soon and I find that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.890" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">know singing with other people is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.710" end="00:46:44.839" style="s2">wonderful thing to do it&#39;s a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:48.109" style="s2">practice in itself praying for others</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.839" end="00:46:50.329" style="s2">and for the world is with other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.109" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve joked myself every day anyway but</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.329" end="00:46:54.500" style="s2">today with others I think is more</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">powerful and to be in these old holy</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.500" end="00:46:58.849" style="s2">place when I&#39;m in a village I get to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:02.770" style="s2">village challenge may only be 3 or 4</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.849" end="00:47:05.500" style="s2">people there but it&#39;s still I find</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.770" end="00:47:07.300" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s boring that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.500" end="00:47:10.510" style="s2">they&#39;re boring sometimes often there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.300" end="00:47:13.390" style="s2">quite good ones actually but for me I</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.510" end="00:47:16.090" style="s2">nearly always emerge feeling uplifted</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.390" end="00:47:18.910" style="s2">and in a better state to start the week</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.090" end="00:47:21.400" style="s2">and if I don&#39;t go and I just read</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.910" end="00:47:25.480" style="s2">depressing news in Sunday newspapers or</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.400" end="00:47:28.570" style="s2">or have to deal with emails or something</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.480" end="00:47:34.770" style="s2">I so I found these really helpful these</p>
