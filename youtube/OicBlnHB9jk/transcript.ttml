<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:23.890" style="s2">in such species and these guys seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.400" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">have found that as the ability to coerce</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.890" end="00:03:29.530" style="s2">through male genital size increases so</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:33.709" style="s2">does the cognitive ability of females</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.530" end="00:03:36.320" style="s2">increase in order to upset the would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.709" end="00:03:39.800" style="s2">coercive strategies alright well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.320" end="00:03:41.510" style="s2">start here though first we should point</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.800" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">out that in humans things work a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.510" end="00:03:47.060" style="s2">differently and totally lacking in gone</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">a podium well but being hung like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.060" end="00:03:52.910" style="s2">horse is more likely to make you better</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.100" end="00:03:55.730" style="s2">able to persuade but not coerce I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.910" end="00:03:58.910" style="s2">see how it would help you coerce yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.730" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">okay but here the thing that I find</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.910" end="00:04:02.360" style="s2">curious about this and I haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">the paper I&#39;m just going off the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.360" end="00:04:11.420" style="s2">abstract here is that I might expect the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:14.299" style="s2">longer gana podía to select for larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.420" end="00:04:16.910" style="s2">brain size in females but why if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.299" end="00:04:19.790" style="s2">select for the larger gana podium do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.910" end="00:04:23.240" style="s2">get larger brain size so the paper says</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.790" end="00:04:27.290" style="s2">kinetic correlation but is this because</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.240" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">this trait varies in a wild population</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.290" end="00:04:32.990" style="s2">and that therefore a female who is born</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:35.000" style="s2">into this population with that parameter</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.990" end="00:04:37.490" style="s2">having been turned up for male genital</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.000" end="00:04:39.950" style="s2">size knows that she is in a population</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.490" end="00:04:42.200" style="s2">in which coercion is likely to be more</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.950" end="00:04:43.760" style="s2">effective and therefore this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.200" end="00:04:47.420" style="s2">automatically favored that sounds a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.760" end="00:04:51.530" style="s2">little far-fetched to me yeah I I grant</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.420" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">that it&#39;s it it&#39;s just correlation</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.530" end="00:04:56.480" style="s2">without providing an obvious mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:58.370" style="s2">for how they might be causally linked</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.480" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">how they might have become how they</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.370" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">might have become causally linked</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:05.180" style="s2">because doesn&#39;t it appear to be that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:08.090" style="s2">argument is that female brain size is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.180" end="00:05:10.850" style="s2">enhanced in order to avoid coercive</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.090" end="00:05:13.640" style="s2">males and it is imagined that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.850" end="00:05:17.150" style="s2">coerciveness of males has an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.640" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">proxy in general sighs yep all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.150" end="00:05:20.480" style="s2">is it more to say here I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of room for more Jo oh sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.480" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">there&#39;s lots more to say but I will say</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">though if we can go meta on it okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:32.600" style="s2">right so we are very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:35.150" style="s2">embarrass with questions and generations</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.600" end="00:05:36.740" style="s2">of students have tried but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.150" end="00:05:39.200" style="s2">they have succeeded and we have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.740" end="00:05:41.570" style="s2">through some some tough some tough</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.200" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">questioning by students designed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.570" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">cause us to blush and anyway if you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:50.330" style="s2">to try game on go for it I will say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have any reason to think</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.330" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">that this question from echo with whom</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:56.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve now been in a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.090" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">communication behind the scenes was sent</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.150" end="00:06:00.500" style="s2">to embarrass I think this person is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:01.880" style="s2">legitimately seeking information in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.500" end="00:06:02.630" style="s2">pursuit of actually some work that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.880" end="00:06:04.850" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.630" end="00:06:08.120" style="s2">I actually think sometimes the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.850" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">want to see you blush they do so they</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.120" end="00:06:13.640" style="s2">attempt to trigger it with some</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:15.920" style="s2">affection oh sure yeah all right so as</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.640" end="00:06:17.660" style="s2">in past Kunis we&#39;re going to restrict</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.920" end="00:06:20.630" style="s2">this to an hour and we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.660" end="00:06:22.940" style="s2">through as many of these that came in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.630" end="00:06:25.250" style="s2">the first live stream as possible in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.940" end="00:06:28.370" style="s2">something like a half an hour so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.250" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">see right now it&#39;s 207 and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.370" end="00:06:35.000" style="s2">switch to the the questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.930" end="00:06:36.290" style="s2">from this live stream and get through as</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.000" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">many of those in the order in which they</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.290" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">came in so for the first live stream we</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:43.639" style="s2">are ranking them just by</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:47.419" style="s2">Terry mount because that is the rubric</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.639" end="00:06:49.850" style="s2">that is easiest to do so the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.419" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">question what is your and this we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.850" end="00:06:52.760" style="s2">considered give me a whole episode on</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:53.960" style="s2">this question so we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.760" end="00:06:56.330" style="s2">spend a whole episode but the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.960" end="00:06:58.669" style="s2">question is what is your opinion of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.330" end="00:07:00.860" style="s2">planned MX series any truth worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.669" end="00:07:03.080" style="s2">researching and let me just say first</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.860" end="00:07:05.330" style="s2">that you know probably people watching</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.080" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">have ran into this we alluded obliquely</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.330" end="00:07:11.110" style="s2">to it in the first half here in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">first live stream but there appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.110" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">at least two maybe more videos</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:18.740" style="s2">circulating there&#39;s a two-hour ish video</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:22.780" style="s2">that&#39;s actually called planned emic I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.740" end="00:07:24.949" style="s2">believe that has all sorts of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.780" end="00:07:27.260" style="s2">hypotheses that it would appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.949" end="00:07:30.590" style="s2">unrelated to copa90 know yet somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.260" end="00:07:32.510" style="s2">they link them yes and then there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.590" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">then there&#39;s a 28 or so minute video</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.510" end="00:07:38.860" style="s2">that is mostly although not entirely the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:42.760" style="s2">filmmaker interviewing the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.860" end="00:07:47.720" style="s2">megabits I think do you think of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.760" end="00:07:49.880" style="s2">as to what she believes understands the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.720" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">situation to be so neither of us have</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.880" end="00:07:53.270" style="s2">watched the 2-hour thing you dipped into</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.490" style="s2">it a little bit and decided it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:08:00.620" style="s2">worth our time dipped right out dipped</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.490" end="00:08:04.610" style="s2">right out the 28 minute video is is more</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.620" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">complicated yeah let&#39;s say a few things</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.610" end="00:08:17.320" style="s2">got it one thing is that it appears that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:20.510" style="s2">Judy Mike Ovitz is a voice that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.320" end="00:08:21.949" style="s2">credentialing that makes this worth</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.510" end="00:08:24.229" style="s2">paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.949" end="00:08:26.750" style="s2">and I must say many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.229" end="00:08:29.990" style="s2">she says while hard for us to evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.750" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">whether they are accurate do have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.990" end="00:08:33.940" style="s2">of plausible ring to them with respect</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">to how academic politics for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.940" end="00:08:38.810" style="s2">functions on the other hand there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:43.959" style="s2">bunch of things in that half-hour</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.810" end="00:08:51.050" style="s2">documentary that are incorrect and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.959" end="00:08:54.140" style="s2">what I&#39;m left with is this has caught</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.050" end="00:09:01.010" style="s2">the public imagination if I take my</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.140" end="00:09:05.510" style="s2">a professional toolkit to it what I get</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.010" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">are things I can&#39;t evaluate things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:13.670" style="s2">are true and concerning and other things</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:18.830" style="s2">I know to be false which leaves me with</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.670" end="00:09:20.960" style="s2">the sense that this is not a it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.830" end="00:09:23.630" style="s2">certainly not to be taken at face value</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.960" end="00:09:28.010" style="s2">there&#39;s enough wrong with the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.630" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">that is presented that I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.010" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t advise people to circulate it</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:37.460" style="s2">as if it&#39;s right which says can we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">pause there the the mixture of that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.460" end="00:09:41.840" style="s2">actually understand from other sources</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:45.520" style="s2">to be true even if even though and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.840" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">perhaps of course it doesn&#39;t satisfy the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.520" end="00:09:54.530" style="s2">shared common narrative being pushed by</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:55.580" style="s2">most new sources that other thing I know</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.530" end="00:09:58.250" style="s2">not to be true</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.580" end="00:10:02.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s a whole lot here that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.250" end="00:10:05.150" style="s2">cannot assess independently that mixture</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.120" end="00:10:08.450" style="s2">is exactly what makes this very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.150" end="00:10:12.970" style="s2">difficult to assess and you know unlike</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.450" end="00:10:17.690" style="s2">say the current County video which</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.970" end="00:10:19.850" style="s2">didn&#39;t really have generic claims that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.690" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">couldn&#39;t didn&#39;t have sweeping claims</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.850" end="00:10:23.780" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t be assessed either by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.700" style="s2">numbers they themselves gave or from</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.780" end="00:10:28.490" style="s2">other sources and so it was possible to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.700" end="00:10:31.550" style="s2">go through and say actually there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.490" end="00:10:34.370" style="s2">whole lot here that just isn&#39;t true with</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.550" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">with this video with Mike Ovitz megabits</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.370" end="00:10:39.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to pronounce your name</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:43.070" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.020" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">know about the veracity of claims about</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.070" end="00:10:50.470" style="s2">what happened that ended up with her</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:53.630" style="s2">being absent prison I gather given that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.470" end="00:10:55.370" style="s2">those it&#39;s it&#39;s exactly in locked</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.630" end="00:10:56.810" style="s2">documents you know we have no we have no</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.370" end="00:10:58.790" style="s2">way of perceiving it but do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.810" end="00:11:02.840" style="s2">say anything about what what you what</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.790" end="00:11:03.860" style="s2">you saw that you think is not yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.840" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">should if we&#39;re gonna do that we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.860" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">probably come back to it systematically</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:08.470" style="s2">later there were a number of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:10.150" style="s2">places or</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.470" end="00:11:13.450" style="s2">an alarm bell went off and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.150" end="00:11:16.330" style="s2">that claim doesn&#39;t isn&#39;t right I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.450" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">obvious one had to do with her point</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.330" end="00:11:25.210" style="s2">about the sand in the beaches containing</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:31.570" style="s2">microbes that are necessary for immunity</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.210" end="00:11:34.570" style="s2">relative to Carabas running iris the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.570" end="00:11:37.900" style="s2">fact is this isn&#39;t how the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.570" end="00:11:40.660" style="s2">works there is truth to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.900" end="00:11:45.250" style="s2">the immune system becomes informed of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.660" end="00:11:47.560" style="s2">hazards based on encountering things in</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.250" end="00:11:49.900" style="s2">the wild and so the old George Carlin</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.560" end="00:11:52.870" style="s2">routine about training the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.900" end="00:11:56.529" style="s2">by swimming in the Hudson because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.870" end="00:11:59.230" style="s2">needs practice isn&#39;t without merit but</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.529" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">the idea that the net benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.230" end="00:12:04.450" style="s2">encountering this coronavirus and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">wild would point in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.450" end="00:12:09.430" style="s2">beach being curative no no what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.520" end="00:12:10.570" style="s2">curative about the beach is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.430" end="00:12:12.010" style="s2">outdoors where it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.570" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">transmit this thing and you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.010" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">Sun so you&#39;re making vitamin D and those</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">two things together suggest actually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.260" style="s2">beach is probably a good place to go so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:22.780" style="s2">vision wise it feels like confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.260" end="00:12:24.640" style="s2">bias right like ah let&#39;s pick one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.780" end="00:12:26.470" style="s2">very many bad policies that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.640" end="00:12:29.140" style="s2">handed down don&#39;t go to the beach yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.470" end="00:12:31.540" style="s2">and choose that as evidence that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.140" end="00:12:35.380" style="s2">government plot to keep people sick</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.540" end="00:12:36.820" style="s2">right I see I see no reason to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.380" end="00:12:40.600" style="s2">that that go don&#39;t go to the beach</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.820" end="00:12:42.820" style="s2">orders visited you never imagined</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.600" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">conspiracy when simple incompetence will</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.820" end="00:12:46.930" style="s2">do the job and this you know this looks</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:48.970" style="s2">like not saying that there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.930" end="00:12:51.400" style="s2">conspiracy yeah but with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.970" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">beach orders invoking conspiracy to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.400" end="00:12:59.110" style="s2">explain the beach orders also seemed</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">uncared best yeah so there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.110" end="00:13:02.950" style="s2">heart that I actually there were two</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.170" style="s2">questions about the plan demmick let me</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.950" end="00:13:06.670" style="s2">just see if we can address the other one</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.170" end="00:13:07.540" style="s2">while we&#39;re addressing this one it would</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.670" end="00:13:08.920" style="s2">be good to hear from someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.540" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">knowledgeable regarding the claims made</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.920" end="00:13:15.880" style="s2">by Mike Ovitz parentheses chronic</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.470" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">another one of the things that set off a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:30.460" style="s2">red flag for me was she said if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:33.460" style="s2">ever gotten you say if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.460" end="00:13:35.890" style="s2">gotten a flu vaccine then you have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.460" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">injected with corona virus because these</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.890" end="00:13:40.330" style="s2">things are grown in animal media because</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:44.500" style="s2">these things are grown in animal media</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.330" end="00:13:45.640" style="s2">and all the animals that are sourced for</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.500" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">the animal media which they&#39;re grown</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.640" end="00:13:50.170" style="s2">have corona viruses circulating in them</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:52.690" style="s2">that was the logical yeah I would want</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.170" end="00:13:56.500" style="s2">to sleep it&#39;s a lot of leaps and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.690" end="00:13:58.390" style="s2">strikes me as very unlikely but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.500" end="00:14:00.760" style="s2">if you know better if you&#39;ve got those</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.650" end="00:14:11.380" style="s2">wanting the references wanting the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.830" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">jacket you know if the story if the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.380" end="00:14:17.170" style="s2">personal story of Mike Ovitz is is true</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.290" end="00:14:18.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m agnostic on that at this point I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.170" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">think some of it is certainly true and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.580" end="00:14:23.970" style="s2">you know all of it may be true then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:26.740" style="s2">understandable that we couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.970" end="00:14:28.300" style="s2">some of the pieces of that story because</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.740" end="00:14:30.040" style="s2">it would exactly be under some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.040" end="00:14:37.180" style="s2">the but the scientific piece is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.930" end="00:14:39.010" style="s2">logic of what is or is not true or real</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.180" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">or organic about the current thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.010" end="00:14:42.670" style="s2">we&#39;re living through should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.530" style="s2">decipherable by people who have</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.670" end="00:14:45.670" style="s2">sufficient background to decipher</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.530" end="00:14:47.980" style="s2">information when it&#39;s put in front of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.670" end="00:14:50.380" style="s2">them and we found no way to find the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.980" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">information with which to interpret many</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.380" end="00:14:54.130" style="s2">of the claims yeah and if I can just as</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:57.370" style="s2">long as we&#39;re doing this there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.130" end="00:15:01.810" style="s2">conspiracy theory involving there your</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.370" end="00:15:03.790" style="s2">hypothesis very good nice catch there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.810" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">a conspiracy hypothesis that has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.790" end="00:15:09.220" style="s2">offered by one of the Nobel laureates</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:14.410" style="s2">responsible for the discovery of the HIV</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.220" end="00:15:18.610" style="s2">particle and his allegation is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:22.210" style="s2">there is a HIV sequence in the Czar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.610" end="00:15:25.180" style="s2">co2 virus now as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.210" end="00:15:26.860" style="s2">were that the case where a sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.180" end="00:15:31.450" style="s2">long sequence that it had to have come</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.860" end="00:15:33.670" style="s2">from HIV to be found in this virus it</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.450" end="00:15:34.870" style="s2">would be all but game over for</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.670" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">the argument that this was not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.870" end="00:15:40.810" style="s2">laboratory manipulated entity however</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">when one investigates this claim it</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.810" end="00:15:46.900" style="s2">turns out that it is weak on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:48.100" style="s2">that similar sequences are found in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.900" end="00:15:49.960" style="s2">wide variety of things including</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.100" end="00:15:52.750" style="s2">bacteria which aren&#39;t closely related to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.960" end="00:15:55.210" style="s2">viruses at all in any standard sense and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.750" end="00:15:57.400" style="s2">that basically the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.210" end="00:15:59.640" style="s2">something has caused these sequences to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.400" end="00:16:02.260" style="s2">be widespread because they are useful</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.640" end="00:16:04.900" style="s2">means that the discovery that something</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.260" end="00:16:06.850" style="s2">that is short and analogous to something</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.900" end="00:16:09.940" style="s2">found in HIV doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.850" end="00:16:13.210" style="s2">anything at all so that&#39;s the thread to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.940" end="00:16:15.070" style="s2">check there is is it a sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.210" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">improbable sequence that its presence</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.070" end="00:16:18.730" style="s2">there is actually indicative of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:21.220" style="s2">having been transported there which</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.730" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">would be extraordinary well but or</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.220" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">another hypothesis is is it to use the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:30.070" style="s2">technical term pleasee amorphic to both</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.730" end="00:16:32.050" style="s2">HIV and the corona virus which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.070" end="00:16:34.150" style="s2">please the amorphic means is it an</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.050" end="00:16:35.770" style="s2">ancestral state that was shared by the</p>

<p begin="00:16:37.930" end="00:16:42.370" style="s2">implied by I don&#39;t remember his name</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.510" end="00:16:46.330" style="s2">this this Nobel laureates argument that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.370" end="00:16:48.130" style="s2">this is a derived state in HIV or in or</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.330" end="00:16:50.230" style="s2">in viruses like that and a derive state</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.130" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">here and it&#39;s showing up both places</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.230" end="00:16:54.490" style="s2">when it&#39;s such a long and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:57.280" style="s2">complex thing is extremely unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.490" end="00:17:00.250" style="s2">have happened by chance but arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.280" end="00:17:02.080" style="s2">oh my god sturgeon have bones and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.250" end="00:17:03.880" style="s2">have bones and isn&#39;t that really</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.080" end="00:17:05.830" style="s2">unlikely to have happened by chance when</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.880" end="00:17:07.720" style="s2">you can go back and say actually bone</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.830" end="00:17:09.580" style="s2">evolved before the most recent common</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:11.230" style="s2">ancestor of sturgeons and humans evolved</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.580" end="00:17:12.850" style="s2">and therefore there&#39;s nothing to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.230" end="00:17:16.660" style="s2">explained because it is pleasee amorphic</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.850" end="00:17:18.490" style="s2">it is ancestral to the state of the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.660" end="00:17:20.380" style="s2">recent common ancestors so ancestor of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.490" end="00:17:23.200" style="s2">humans and sturgeons whereas if you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.380" end="00:17:25.240" style="s2">oh my god sturgeon have a language and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.200" end="00:17:26.590" style="s2">humans have language that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.240" end="00:17:28.150" style="s2">unlikely to have happened by chance</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.590" end="00:17:29.980" style="s2">there must be something else going on</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.150" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">there and you go back and you say wow</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.980" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">not only does the most recent common</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:34.990" style="s2">ancestor of human in sturgeons don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:36.610" style="s2">have language but the basal mammal</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.990" end="00:17:37.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have language the basal reptile</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.610" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have language so then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.960" end="00:17:42.850" style="s2">something to be explained but in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:45.340" style="s2">case you may be maybe this sequence is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.850" end="00:17:46.520" style="s2">actually ancestral to pleasee amorphic</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.340" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.520" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">most recent common ancestors of the two</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:52.760" style="s2">viruses which would be fabulous if there</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">was reason to think that the two viruses</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.760" end="00:17:57.560" style="s2">were actually linked ancestrally through</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:17:59.990" style="s2">something that we would call a virus</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.560" end="00:18:01.310" style="s2">right right they&#39;re both RNA viruses one</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.990" end="00:18:03.920" style="s2">of them is a retrovirus one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.310" end="00:18:06.110" style="s2">not but we don&#39;t even know that so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.920" end="00:18:07.910" style="s2">we&#39;re discovering is that the tools that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.110" end="00:18:09.890" style="s2">you and I are so familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.910" end="00:18:12.200" style="s2">evolutionary phylogenetic tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.890" end="00:18:16.340" style="s2">reasoning that goes with them works</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:20.360" style="s2">really well for example within you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.340" end="00:18:24.230" style="s2">the SARS Cove - starting in Wuhan that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.360" end="00:18:26.390" style="s2">is to say within a evolution which has</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.230" end="00:18:28.430" style="s2">an origin a single origin and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.390" end="00:18:30.290" style="s2">branching from within a lineage and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.430" end="00:18:31.790" style="s2">it also probably works if you go back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.290" end="00:18:33.620" style="s2">all coronaviruses that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.790" end="00:18:36.530" style="s2">honest-to-goodness clade but if you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.620" end="00:18:38.750" style="s2">back before coronaviruses to let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.530" end="00:18:40.580" style="s2">other viruses and then all of the Tree</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.750" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">of Life we don&#39;t know how to map these</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.580" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">things we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:46.730" style="s2">relationship is in part because the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.210" end="00:18:49.490" style="s2">nature of viruses is to have gotten rid</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.730" end="00:18:51.650" style="s2">of everything they&#39;re not using and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.490" end="00:18:53.540" style="s2">borrow it from their hosts and so in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.650" end="00:18:55.040" style="s2">some sense they leave us scratching</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.540" end="00:18:56.510" style="s2">their heads because they&#39;ve abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.040" end="00:18:58.810" style="s2">all the stuff that would normally allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.510" end="00:19:04.460" style="s2">us to map them on to the Tree of Life</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.810" end="00:19:07.580" style="s2">yeah I think phylogenetic biologists</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.460" end="00:19:10.250" style="s2">have a decent sense at a clade bigger</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.580" end="00:19:14.150" style="s2">than Corona Corona verde I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.250" end="00:19:20.750" style="s2">but it&#39;s not to all viruses or at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.150" end="00:19:23.090" style="s2">the the expected confidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.750" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">phylogenetic tree for all viruses is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.090" end="00:19:29.060" style="s2">very low compared to the confidence at</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">the level of smaller clades and and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.060" end="00:19:35.960" style="s2">viruses link on to the rest of life on</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:38.420" style="s2">Earth I think actually what we can infer</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.960" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">from what we&#39;ve seen is there is no tree</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.420" end="00:19:42.200" style="s2">of all viruses there may be a tree of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">all retroviruses for example but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.200" end="00:19:45.500" style="s2">the viruses have multiple origins so</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:48.980" style="s2">that&#39;s the distinction right there and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.500" end="00:19:50.840" style="s2">the problem is my what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.980" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">the leading hypothesis from what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2">understand is that viruses have actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:19:58.220" style="s2">freed themselves from what they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:19:58.530" style="s2">before they were viruses in other words</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.220" end="00:20:03.060" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.530" end="00:20:05.490" style="s2">were genes within creatures of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.060" end="00:20:07.800" style="s2">and at the point that they leave those</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.490" end="00:20:09.420" style="s2">creatures and strike out on their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.800" end="00:20:11.820" style="s2">and abandon all the machinery that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.420" end="00:20:14.730" style="s2">would need borrowing it from those new</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.820" end="00:20:16.620" style="s2">hosts when they enter them they become</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.730" end="00:20:20.430" style="s2">hard to map but it may be you know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.620" end="00:20:22.860" style="s2">coronaviruses evolved from some tetrapod</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.430" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">then the point is where would you map</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.860" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">them onto the tree well they would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">mapped to the tetrapod most closely</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">associated with the one they emerged</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:32.700" style="s2">from so it would be a very weird tree</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.640" style="s2">because you&#39;d have a virus related to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.700" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">creature you know so anyway it does push</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.640" end="00:20:41.220" style="s2">our tools to a level that they were not</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:43.050" style="s2">built to to explain that&#39;s right okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.220" end="00:20:46.410" style="s2">that&#39;s two questions and half our time</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.050" end="00:20:48.780" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s move a little here</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.410" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">argument for reopening is that I prefer</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.780" end="00:20:52.770" style="s2">3% of people dying probably much lower</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.270" style="s2">than that than my children starving I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.770" end="00:20:55.920" style="s2">can&#39;t rely on government to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.270" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">competent decisions by now there is no</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.920" end="00:21:01.050" style="s2">evidence they are capable of such so not</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">so much a question but a comment and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.050" end="00:21:07.820" style="s2">know we can both understand the concern</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.450" end="00:21:11.640" style="s2">for sure well and I would also say a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:13.890" style="s2">this virus if nothing else raises all</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.640" end="00:21:17.490" style="s2">kinds of questions that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.890" end="00:21:20.490" style="s2">address like why is it that your ability</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.490" end="00:21:22.500" style="s2">to feed your children is anything but</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.490" end="00:21:24.300" style="s2">our collective concern in this case</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.500" end="00:21:26.220" style="s2">presumably neither you nor your children</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:28.710" style="s2">have done anything to invite this and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.220" end="00:21:30.300" style="s2">therefore this is obviously a case in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.710" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">which we are better off taking the risk</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.300" end="00:21:35.610" style="s2">that we all face which is going to be at</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:40.290" style="s2">many different levels and neutralizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.610" end="00:21:42.210" style="s2">it through a path that is social in</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.290" end="00:21:43.860" style="s2">other words just the same way we take</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.210" end="00:21:44.820" style="s2">the risk of your house burning down and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.860" end="00:21:46.260" style="s2">we say actually you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.820" end="00:21:48.030" style="s2">gonna do we&#39;re gonna put a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.260" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">Building in every neighborhood in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.030" end="00:21:50.430" style="s2">there are people who have equipment to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:53.040" style="s2">put your house out of it catches fire</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.430" end="00:21:55.260" style="s2">you call the number and we show up right</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.040" end="00:21:57.420" style="s2">we neutralize that risk as best as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.260" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">can and nobody complains about it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.420" end="00:22:02.340" style="s2">it&#39;s such a great idea well why is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:04.140" style="s2">any different so there&#39;s that as for</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.340" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">government not functioning you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.140" end="00:22:10.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not functioning</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:13.000" style="s2">it is pathological and what I wish is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.390" end="00:22:16.630" style="s2">that when we did not have this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.000" end="00:22:18.429" style="s2">people had been more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.630" end="00:22:20.350" style="s2">having the discussion of how dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.429" end="00:22:22.390" style="s2">it is to have a pathological governance</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.350" end="00:22:23.740" style="s2">apparatus and what might be done to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.390" end="00:22:27.279" style="s2">rescue it from the things that have</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.740" end="00:22:29.169" style="s2">corrupted it next question</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.279" end="00:22:30.789" style="s2">somewhat tongue-in-cheek I think what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.169" end="00:22:33.820" style="s2">the attack vector from back to human</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.789" end="00:22:36.370" style="s2">bite bad breath no it says bad breath</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.820" end="00:22:40.289" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it Oh bite bats breath batch</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.370" end="00:22:43.899" style="s2">breath it does yes yeah this this</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.289" end="00:22:46.179" style="s2">assumes that there was bat to human</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.899" end="00:22:47.409" style="s2">vector and we&#39;ve talked we&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.179" end="00:22:49.870" style="s2">her earlier livestreams about what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.409" end="00:22:52.870" style="s2">might have been I think originally the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.870" end="00:22:55.510" style="s2">wet market hypothesis is that eating</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.870" end="00:22:58.299" style="s2">recently dead bats would have allowed it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">to be transmitted or hand maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.299" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">handling corpse at recent bat corpses</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:06.070" style="s2">and then touching your mouth could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.830" end="00:23:08.769" style="s2">but the think about it from the virus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.070" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">perspective the virus is experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.769" end="00:23:12.039" style="s2">with different mechanisms for getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">into the future one way to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.039" end="00:23:16.990" style="s2">future is to leave the species that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:18.309" style="s2">are currently infecting and find a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.990" end="00:23:19.720" style="s2">species that increases the chances</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.309" end="00:23:21.370" style="s2">you&#39;ll make it in the future because</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.720" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve got two chances rather than one</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.370" end="00:23:26.919" style="s2">two different species are carrying you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:31.090" style="s2">so finding your way into secretions that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.919" end="00:23:33.370" style="s2">are liable to be encountered increases</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.090" end="00:23:39.309" style="s2">the chances of that so I know that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.370" end="00:23:41.769" style="s2">is a rare but established ability I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.309" end="00:23:45.970" style="s2">think I&#39;ve got this right for rabies to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.769" end="00:23:48.309" style="s2">be transmitted by bat urine encountered</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.970" end="00:23:49.750" style="s2">in a cave you know the bats are on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.309" end="00:23:51.700" style="s2">ceiling of the cave you walk through the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.750" end="00:23:54.010" style="s2">cave there&#39;s a mist in the air some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.700" end="00:23:56.110" style="s2">it is bat urine and it gets in your eye</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.010" end="00:23:57.730" style="s2">you&#39;re not working on behalf of the bat</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.110" end="00:24:00.639" style="s2">PR department at the moment or no</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.730" end="00:24:03.970" style="s2">unfortunately not sorry bats but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.639" end="00:24:05.830" style="s2">anyway it could be anything but imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.970" end="00:24:07.750" style="s2">that viruses that have made it if this</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.830" end="00:24:09.309" style="s2">is the future for all of the viruses in</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.750" end="00:24:10.899" style="s2">the past how did they get here they</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.309" end="00:24:12.250" style="s2">found their way into secretions that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.899" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">were liable to be encountered by other</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.250" end="00:24:15.639" style="s2">creatures and they had a generalist</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:17.289" style="s2">enough plan to be able to invade the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.639" end="00:24:18.919" style="s2">cells of those creatures some fraction</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.289" end="00:24:21.350" style="s2">of the time when they found them and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.919" end="00:24:24.169" style="s2">they had a genomic plan that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.350" end="00:24:27.109" style="s2">sufficiently experimental to find its</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.169" end="00:24:29.629" style="s2">way from one part of history to the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.109" end="00:24:32.779" style="s2">yep so anyway that&#39;s what they do it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.629" end="00:24:35.419" style="s2">unlikely to have been bite in this case</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.779" end="00:24:37.580" style="s2">because of the clade of bats that this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.419" end="00:24:40.580" style="s2">current a virus is or related conent</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.580" end="00:24:42.289" style="s2">corona viruses are known from well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.580" end="00:24:44.059" style="s2">not sure why you say that if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.289" end="00:24:47.809" style="s2">was handling these bats they would have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.059" end="00:24:49.070" style="s2">probably bit hmm so handling either for</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.809" end="00:24:51.409" style="s2">food or for research</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.070" end="00:24:53.149" style="s2">yeah or you know bat falls out of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.409" end="00:24:54.889" style="s2">sky cuz it&#39;s sick and you pick it up and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.149" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">it bites you cuz it&#39;s afraid that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.889" end="00:24:59.359" style="s2">so unlikely but again I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:01.489" style="s2">chances of this having come directly</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.359" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">from a bat to a human without lab</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.489" end="00:25:05.649" style="s2">involvement seems pretty remote explore</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:07.909" style="s2">and Laura yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.649" end="00:25:09.230" style="s2">dear hmb thank you so much for your</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.909" end="00:25:12.289" style="s2">invaluable contributions to the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.230" end="00:25:14.330" style="s2">sanity on May 6th I emailed you about</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.289" end="00:25:15.619" style="s2">the newest kovat 19 research in Slovenia</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.330" end="00:25:18.139" style="s2">would love to hear what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.619" end="00:25:18.350" style="s2">it we saw this I have not looked into it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.139" end="00:25:21.590" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.350" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">but I and it&#39;s as I remember some large</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.590" end="00:25:26.179" style="s2">very large scale testing that is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:28.549" style="s2">potentially establishes at least for</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.179" end="00:25:31.700" style="s2">this particular locality geographic</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.549" end="00:25:34.039" style="s2">locality some some good baseline</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.700" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">statistics yep I agree it was a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.039" end="00:25:38.450" style="s2">large-scale study but I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:40.460" style="s2">through it in detail yet what is a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.450" end="00:25:41.869" style="s2">way to talk down those people who think</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.460" end="00:25:43.159" style="s2">that being socially distant will kill</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.869" end="00:25:45.409" style="s2">our immune systems because we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.159" end="00:25:47.090" style="s2">exposed to anything I know this is false</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.409" end="00:25:50.359" style="s2">but how can i frame it in a way to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.090" end="00:25:53.509" style="s2">that makes sense I would say this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.359" end="00:25:56.600" style="s2">question this is a simple case of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.509" end="00:25:59.149" style="s2">two things one exposure does create</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.600" end="00:26:01.730" style="s2">immunity often it creates it through</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.149" end="00:26:04.639" style="s2">mechanisms that are unacceptable so for</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.730" end="00:26:08.299" style="s2">example let&#39;s take chicken pox chicken</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.639" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">pox is a serious disease that if you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.299" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">it late in life can be a deadly disease</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:15.980" style="s2">in order to prevent people from getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:18.139" style="s2">it late in life people of our generation</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.980" end="00:26:21.499" style="s2">were often exposed to chicken pox in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.139" end="00:26:24.200" style="s2">youth which then creates a horrible risk</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.499" end="00:26:25.759" style="s2">of shingles late in life I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.200" end="00:26:28.220" style="s2">that was known when we were kids and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.759" end="00:26:30.889" style="s2">people decided so but in any case we now</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.220" end="00:26:32.090" style="s2">know that connection so how costly was</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.889" end="00:26:34.220" style="s2">it for us to have been give</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.090" end="00:26:37.010" style="s2">chicken pox as kids in order to protect</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.220" end="00:26:41.480" style="s2">us later it had a big cost in this case</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.010" end="00:26:43.850" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with a virus with unknown</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.480" end="00:26:45.650" style="s2">hazard to you there are so many ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.850" end="00:26:47.150" style="s2">some of them unlikely but there&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.850" end="00:33:59.930" style="s2">through history so in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.830" end="00:34:02.180" style="s2">ship has already sailed maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.930" end="00:34:04.700" style="s2">get the benefit at the moment and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.180" end="00:34:07.640" style="s2">when this is over or if it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.700" end="00:34:10.040" style="s2">chronic at the point that we are capable</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.640" end="00:34:12.470" style="s2">of focusing on other things we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.040" end="00:34:14.360" style="s2">have a very frank conversation about how</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.470" end="00:34:17.840" style="s2">it is that we have all ended up</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.360" end="00:34:20.570" style="s2">surveilled in nearly 24 hours a day for</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.840" end="00:34:22.610" style="s2">you know every day of the year and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.570" end="00:34:24.919" style="s2">information is accumulating and being</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.610" end="00:34:27.710" style="s2">used for who knows what it&#39;s time we</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.919" end="00:34:29.810" style="s2">have the conversation about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.710" end="00:34:31.490" style="s2">constitutional protections that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.810" end="00:34:33.830" style="s2">have because the founding fathers had</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.490" end="00:34:38.060" style="s2">never seen anything as sophisticated as</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.830" end="00:34:40.190" style="s2">a train much less an Internet and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.060" end="00:34:41.629" style="s2">therefore could could it was not failure</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.190" end="00:34:43.190" style="s2">of imagination on their part so they</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.629" end="00:34:46.370" style="s2">could not possibly have gotten it mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.190" end="00:34:48.500" style="s2">we&#39;re close to imagining this world that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.370" end="00:34:50.870" style="s2">we live in they needed to sit down with</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.500" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">black mirror and to see a few episodes</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.870" end="00:34:57.740" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t possible at the time yep</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:34:59.720" style="s2">since it&#39;s technically possible why</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.740" end="00:35:01.580" style="s2">hasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t Robert Dorfman&#39;s method</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.720" end="00:35:03.260" style="s2">for group testing parenthesis combining</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.580" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">swabs or test samples from many people</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.260" end="00:35:07.660" style="s2">into one lab test used to increase</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.240" end="00:35:10.280" style="s2">testing capability I&#39;m not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.660" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">Robert Dorfman but that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.280" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">totally reasonable approach any group</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:17.630" style="s2">test comes back positive and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:19.070" style="s2">parts it out and you do individual tests</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.630" end="00:35:23.210" style="s2">on all the people who contributed to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.070" end="00:35:24.580" style="s2">one why isn&#39;t it don&#39;t no no no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.210" end="00:35:27.460" style="s2">seems reasonable yep</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.580" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">what is what is the evolutionary reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.460" end="00:35:31.540" style="s2">for males having nipples so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">say that this is a question that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.540" end="00:35:36.760" style="s2">when you were tending that part of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:38.260" style="s2">patreon actively you would ask that as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.760" end="00:35:39.940" style="s2">question that people want to hear the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.260" end="00:35:42.220" style="s2">answer to that in the next the next</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.940" end="00:35:46.230" style="s2">month and it never got voted up it never</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.220" end="00:35:48.370" style="s2">got voted to the level such that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.230" end="00:35:50.290" style="s2">answered that question rather than some</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.370" end="00:35:52.210" style="s2">other question I was trying to remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.290" end="00:35:53.830" style="s2">if it had your recollection is it did</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.210" end="00:35:57.610" style="s2">not get answered I think it did not all</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.830" end="00:36:00.520" style="s2">right so a few things to say one you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.610" end="00:36:04.870" style="s2">could have your nipples removed and see</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.520" end="00:36:08.350" style="s2">how well you do in finding a mate and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.870" end="00:36:11.080" style="s2">suspect you would find that many people</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.350" end="00:36:12.430" style="s2">would refuse to to go out with you once</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.080" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">they figured out that you were lacking</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.430" end="00:36:16.600" style="s2">them that&#39;s a terrible answer and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:18.820" style="s2">know it alright fair enough I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.600" end="00:36:21.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s a very proximate answer if</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.820" end="00:36:22.540" style="s2">you lost your nipples now it would</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.190" end="00:36:24.610" style="s2">strike people as pretty weird it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.540" end="00:36:24.910" style="s2">approximate at every possible level all</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.610" end="00:36:27.490" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.910" end="00:36:31.210" style="s2">so let&#39;s just say this I believe this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.490" end="00:36:33.810" style="s2">question has a very good end to me I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.210" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">think fully satisfying answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.810" end="00:36:40.450" style="s2">unfortunately for you that answer is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:42.550" style="s2">closely tied with the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.450" end="00:36:45.460" style="s2">is the evolutionary meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.550" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">homosexuality which is a lecture I</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.460" end="00:36:53.910" style="s2">desperately want to deliver and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:57.060" style="s2">want to explore it piecemeal in these</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.910" end="00:36:59.530" style="s2">broadcasts so anyway I had thought about</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.060" end="00:37:01.780" style="s2">renting a hall I&#39;d still like to do it I</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.530" end="00:37:03.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know if renting a hall is still</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.780" end="00:37:04.780" style="s2">going to be a thing in the future but if</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.250" end="00:37:07.870" style="s2">it is maybe we should explore doing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.780" end="00:37:10.270" style="s2">that way but just remember these two</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.870" end="00:37:14.340" style="s2">questions are related and not directly</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.270" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">but logically let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.340" end="00:37:19.000" style="s2">let&#39;s see we&#39;re gonna do we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:20.770" style="s2">to get through four more quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.000" end="00:37:22.270" style="s2">apologies for all the good questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.770" end="00:37:23.770" style="s2">that we won&#39;t get through before we go</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.270" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">to the super check questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.770" end="00:37:27.850" style="s2">next from the current live chat</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:29.380" style="s2">previously you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.850" end="00:37:31.060" style="s2">antibacterial products leads to building</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.380" end="00:37:32.590" style="s2">up of bacterial resistance over time</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.060" end="00:37:34.330" style="s2">while washing hands with soap does not</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.590" end="00:37:35.890" style="s2">what about UV light cleaning devices</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.330" end="00:37:38.390" style="s2">great podcast</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.890" end="00:37:42.230" style="s2">even though light should should not have</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.390" end="00:37:43.310" style="s2">the same problem as antibacterial soap</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.230" end="00:37:46.520" style="s2">antibacterial</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.310" end="00:37:48.410" style="s2">clears yeah I think the real question is</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.520" end="00:37:50.300" style="s2">this if you&#39;ve got something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.410" end="00:37:51.890" style="s2">creates an extreme enough environment</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.300" end="00:37:53.690" style="s2">that it just kills the things it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.890" end="00:37:56.090" style="s2">encounters outright then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.690" end="00:37:58.610" style="s2">selecting for resistance to them the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.090" end="00:38:01.850" style="s2">problem with the antibacterials is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.610" end="00:38:05.390" style="s2">they basically provide an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.850" end="00:38:08.090" style="s2">gradient where things that are better</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.390" end="00:38:10.190" style="s2">positioned to endure the onslaught</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.090" end="00:38:12.620" style="s2">persist and you&#39;ve killed off all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.190" end="00:38:13.850" style="s2">things that are susceptible so just like</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.620" end="00:38:15.650" style="s2">not taking your full course of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.850" end="00:38:16.910" style="s2">antibiotics if you take the full course</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.650" end="00:38:18.500" style="s2">and you kill off everything that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.910" end="00:38:21.740" style="s2">been infected with then you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.500" end="00:38:23.660" style="s2">selected for superbugs if you kill off a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.740" end="00:38:26.360" style="s2">fraction and then you stop taking it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.660" end="00:38:28.190" style="s2">then you create the next group of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.360" end="00:38:30.770" style="s2">superbugs so so I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.190" end="00:38:34.870" style="s2">possible that especially a weak or an</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.770" end="00:38:39.890" style="s2">inappropriately applied UV light could</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.870" end="00:38:43.000" style="s2">select for those viruses that are better</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.890" end="00:38:46.100" style="s2">able to withstand slightly elevated UV</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.000" end="00:38:49.160" style="s2">rather than they die at the first</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.100" end="00:38:51.590" style="s2">exposure to any UV well on the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.160" end="00:38:53.360" style="s2">hand though they&#39;re being exposed to UV</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.590" end="00:38:55.340" style="s2">light all the time and dying so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.360" end="00:38:57.110" style="s2">not adding a selective force that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.340" end="00:39:00.260" style="s2">going to be giving them some new</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.110" end="00:39:02.450" style="s2">discovery a UV inside right as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.260" end="00:39:06.170" style="s2">to you know Purell is an evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.450" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">novel thing well it is except the thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.170" end="00:39:12.680" style="s2">about Purell that works is alcohol which</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">is not novel and so in my opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.680" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">you know I&#39;d love to see if this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:21.560" style="s2">incorrect but my best guess is that very</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">simple approach is to create an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.560" end="00:39:30.890" style="s2">environment for bacteria and viruses</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:33.710" style="s2">render them unlikely to evolve into some</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.890" end="00:39:35.270" style="s2">kind of objectionable resistance because</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.710" end="00:39:39.220" style="s2">for one thing as soon as you removed</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.270" end="00:39:42.140" style="s2">that phenomenon they will evolve back</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.220" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">down into normalcy as a result of trade</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.140" end="00:39:45.500" style="s2">offs so that is to say if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:48.080" style="s2">evolved and there&#39;s nothing in principle</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.500" end="00:39:49.500" style="s2">that makes it impossible for a creature</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.080" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">to evolve resistance</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.500" end="00:39:54.119" style="s2">to a high alcohol environment but if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:55.859" style="s2">does it&#39;s then poorly adapted to a low</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.119" end="00:39:57.780" style="s2">alcohol environment and so it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.859" end="00:40:00.630" style="s2">effective under normal circumstances so</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.780" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a game to be played about not</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.630" end="00:40:06.619" style="s2">selecting four characteristics you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:09.210" style="s2">want to see and the simple physical</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.619" end="00:40:11.130" style="s2">interrupters I think are the best bet</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.210" end="00:40:13.109" style="s2">yeah it was so when we have homes that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.130" end="00:40:15.990" style="s2">are simultaneously far cleaner than our</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.109" end="00:40:19.830" style="s2">ancestral environments and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.990" end="00:40:22.950" style="s2">far dirtier so even people who clean</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.830" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">their homes to a level that looks</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.950" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">immaculate and sparkling probably have</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:31.890" style="s2">corners that don&#39;t get much wind don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.780" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">okay very very quickly then where are we</p>

<p begin="00:41:32.940" end="00:41:36.270" style="s2">are we stagnating in terms of human</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:39.180" style="s2">evolution and if so are these mechanisms</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.810" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">evolution via genetic engineering such</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:51.359" style="s2">as CRISPR well I think the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:54.390" style="s2">CRISPR has been overhyped it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.359" end="00:41:56.760" style="s2">powerful technology but we are when I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.390" end="00:41:59.070" style="s2">have said elsewhere is that we have the</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.070" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">any genetic sequence but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.800" end="00:42:05.970" style="s2">is the Rosetta</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.970" end="00:42:10.829" style="s2">eventually get there but for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.829" end="00:42:12.599" style="s2">the ability of this technology to allow</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.829" end="00:42:15.779" style="s2">somebody to just bring something into</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.599" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">the world that is devastating or</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">limited by the fact that we don&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:26.730" style="s2">know how to do it what we do know how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:29.430" style="s2">do is take the Lego that exists in the</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.430" end="00:42:34.710" style="s2">DNA and recombine them and this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.190" end="00:42:38.099" style="s2">exactly the concern about what may have</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.710" end="00:42:40.140" style="s2">happened with SARS Cove - is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.099" end="00:42:42.690" style="s2">something that in and of itself wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.140" end="00:42:44.670" style="s2">have been all that capable of infecting</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.690" end="00:42:47.220" style="s2">humans and would have had to do a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.220" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">point may have been created in a form</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.390" end="00:43:02.309" style="s2">switch over to the next live chat is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.539" end="00:43:04.289" style="s2">true that no RNA vaccine has ever been</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.289" end="00:43:11.730" style="s2">McVitie Oh teaser said that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.829" end="00:43:15.690" style="s2">think it&#39;s totally true but I believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.730" end="00:43:18.779" style="s2">that what may have been referenced was</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.690" end="00:43:22.529" style="s2">for people in other words I believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.779" end="00:43:25.109" style="s2">there is a vaccine for a corona virus in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.529" end="00:43:30.299" style="s2">horses I&#39;m taking other people&#39;s word</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.109" end="00:43:32.490" style="s2">for this but but I believe that it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.299" end="00:43:35.099" style="s2">exist now a horse physiologically isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.490" end="00:43:38.660" style="s2">all that distinct you know it&#39;s a mammal</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.099" end="00:43:43.829" style="s2">so it may be a fine model in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.660" end="00:43:46.019" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean you know why if</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.829" end="00:43:48.660" style="s2">they exist for horses do they not exist</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.019" end="00:43:51.569" style="s2">for people it may be the need for them</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.660" end="00:43:54.809" style="s2">has been low because we&#39;ve arrested the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.569" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">couple of escapees that have circulated</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.809" end="00:43:58.769" style="s2">in humans or it may be that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:00.059" style="s2">something about creating the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.769" end="00:44:01.829" style="s2">that there&#39;s a trade-off you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.059" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">want to accept you know horses don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.829" end="00:44:07.559" style="s2">live as long as people maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:11.039" style="s2">longevity concern but I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.559" end="00:44:12.930" style="s2">don&#39;t what I have seen does not suggest</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.039" end="00:44:15.269" style="s2">that a vaccine is just something we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.930" end="00:44:17.579" style="s2">create because we need one there is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.269" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">lot that stands between us and a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.579" end="00:44:28.769" style="s2">that is safe enough to use if in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:30.390" style="s2">can create one at all yeah yeah please</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.769" end="00:44:32.039" style="s2">thanks Zach</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.390" end="00:44:33.660" style="s2">first drink is on me yeah it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.039" end="00:44:37.589" style="s2">early for us here yeah it&#39;s not five</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.660" end="00:44:39.269" style="s2">o&#39;clock anywhere speen so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.589" end="00:44:41.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not drinking on camera today</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.269" end="00:44:44.009" style="s2">have we seen spaceship earth or thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.640" end="00:44:45.690" style="s2">on biodome - project have not seen a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.009" end="00:44:48.180" style="s2">spaceship Earth&#39;s I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.690" end="00:44:52.710" style="s2">much about the second biodome no project</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.180" end="00:44:56.339" style="s2">I would say it was kind of - too naive</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.710" end="00:44:57.630" style="s2">to bias fear - yeah yeah yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.339" end="00:44:59.490" style="s2">that&#39;s not the same thing that I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.630" end="00:45:02.579" style="s2">thinking a biosphere yeah yeah let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.490" end="00:45:04.230" style="s2">it this way it is very difficult I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.579" end="00:45:06.690" style="s2">one of the lessons of these things it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.230" end="00:45:10.710" style="s2">very difficult to create an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.690" end="00:45:12.869" style="s2">that is closed right and that ought to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.710" end="00:45:14.730" style="s2">tell us something about what we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.869" end="00:45:17.250" style="s2">and this is something I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.730" end="00:45:20.670" style="s2">biologists especially field biologists</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.250" end="00:45:21.930" style="s2">encounter I remember there&#39;s a one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.670" end="00:45:24.569" style="s2">the most marvelous creatures in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.930" end="00:45:27.000" style="s2">Madagascar is a thing called an injury</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.569" end="00:45:28.859" style="s2">injury is a very large it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.000" end="00:45:30.710" style="s2">technically a lemur it&#39;s a linear it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.859" end="00:45:33.539" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a beautiful creature</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.710" end="00:45:36.289" style="s2">tree-dwelling sounds like humpback</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.539" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">whales rid you&#39;re not it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.289" end="00:45:41.640" style="s2">that&#39;s andreadd but it&#39;s average all</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:45.000" style="s2">right sorry for your purposes in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.640" end="00:45:47.190" style="s2">lemur but in any case injuries are a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.000" end="00:45:49.650" style="s2">marvelous creature and so marvelous that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.190" end="00:45:51.630" style="s2">every zoo would love to have them no Zoo</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.650" end="00:45:54.990" style="s2">has one why because if you take them</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.630" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">into captivity they die even if you as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.990" end="00:46:00.390" style="s2">understand it even if you put fences</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:02.099" style="s2">around some large piece of habitat that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.390" end="00:46:05.039" style="s2">they&#39;re already living in they die</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.099" end="00:46:06.930" style="s2">they&#39;re so sensitive to the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.039" end="00:46:09.900" style="s2">of captivity that we haven&#39;t figured out</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.930" end="00:46:13.140" style="s2">how to include enough stuff in anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.900" end="00:46:15.299" style="s2">other than a reserve to allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.140" end="00:46:17.670" style="s2">survive yeah it was imagined that it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.299" end="00:46:19.799" style="s2">about the vast number of species of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.670" end="00:46:23.099" style="s2">leaves there full of ours that they need</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.799" end="00:46:24.299" style="s2">to eat but as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.099" end="00:46:28.019" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t looked into it for a few</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.299" end="00:46:29.970" style="s2">years but yes you can&#39;t you can&#39;t cage</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.019" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">them even a really really large cages</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.970" end="00:46:32.339" style="s2">which means if your own been to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:34.289" style="s2">Madagascar you haven&#39;t seen injuries you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.339" end="00:46:36.559" style="s2">may well have seen video of them but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.289" end="00:46:39.690" style="s2">can only see them in the world which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.559" end="00:46:42.210" style="s2">both magical that you still have to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.690" end="00:46:44.999" style="s2">there to actually see them and also</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.210" end="00:46:48.029" style="s2">should remind us in our hubris that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.999" end="00:46:50.220" style="s2">cannot actually totally recreate almost</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.029" end="00:46:51.869" style="s2">anything even for those systems where it</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.220" end="00:46:53.640" style="s2">appears that we can recreate what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.869" end="00:46:55.380" style="s2">necessary right and so these biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.640" end="00:46:57.660" style="s2">projects the good ones are gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.380" end="00:46:58.829" style="s2">into this which is you know how big</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.660" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">would it have to be to be a closed</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.829" end="00:47:03.210" style="s2">system and as I think you were hinting</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.989" style="s2">at we also need to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.210" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">this with respect to these ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.989" end="00:47:11.369" style="s2">colonizing Mars and yes I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:12.930" style="s2">you Elon Mars not only is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.369" end="00:47:14.549" style="s2">be any fun but it&#39;s going to be much</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.930" end="00:47:16.499" style="s2">more difficult to colonize than anybody</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.499" end="00:47:23.279" style="s2">recognizing yeah okay next question asks</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.779" end="00:47:24.869" style="s2">about me we haven&#39;t seen at least I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.279" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t so I&#39;ll read it then we&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.869" end="00:47:26.789" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:28.410" style="s2">what do you guys make out of the DoD</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.789" end="00:47:30.269" style="s2">document that leaked this week the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.410" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">recruit diagnosed with Koba 19 by a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.269" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">laboratory test or clinician examination</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">will be permanently disqualified</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:40.019" style="s2">reported by military times calm that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:42.299" style="s2">will look into it I have an immediate</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.019" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">reaction which is what why would they</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.299" end="00:47:46.499" style="s2">disqualify someone who had already had</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:49.079" style="s2">it yes and I&#39;m trying to remember what</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.499" end="00:47:52.219" style="s2">military times.com is I think it may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.079" end="00:47:55.140" style="s2">it may not be what it appears yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.219" end="00:47:56.910" style="s2">are you familiar with the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.140" end="00:48:02.369" style="s2">of the molecular biologists over at nerd</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.910" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">has power that we plea calm if not may</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.369" end="00:48:06.539" style="s2">want to check it out I feel like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:09.950" style="s2">may be the link that you just sent me</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.539" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m aware of it it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.950" end="00:48:16.259" style="s2">within the confines of my thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:19.890" style="s2">what the most likely path of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.259" end="00:48:23.239" style="s2">pathogen was so anyway yes it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.890" end="00:48:26.069" style="s2">interesting and an interesting paper yep</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.239" end="00:48:28.259" style="s2">the concepts of rights and justice seem</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.069" end="00:48:30.569" style="s2">to be human concoctions are they only</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.259" end="00:48:33.349" style="s2">metaphorically true can literally fin</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.569" end="00:48:33.349" style="s2">them be counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.650" end="00:48:39.700" style="s2">rights injustice first of all I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.990" end="00:48:43.330" style="s2">there&#39;s no justice outside of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.700" end="00:48:45.250" style="s2">there&#39;s some rudimentary ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.330" end="00:48:46.300" style="s2">fairness that we can demonstrate in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.250" end="00:48:49.930" style="s2">other creature there&#39;s a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.300" end="00:48:52.270" style="s2">fairness but in terms of a system that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.930" end="00:48:55.750" style="s2">defines something as just and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.270" end="00:48:57.640" style="s2">attempts to create that space I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.750" end="00:49:00.730" style="s2">the way to think of it is it is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.640" end="00:49:03.070" style="s2">elevated state above that which we would</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.730" end="00:49:05.080" style="s2">live at under normal circumstances is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.070" end="00:49:07.690" style="s2">natural well we&#39;re humans and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.080" end="00:49:09.940" style="s2">generate artificial states so they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.690" end="00:49:14.230" style="s2">in some sense natural but it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.940" end="00:49:16.750" style="s2">fragile state so I would argue rights</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.230" end="00:49:19.210" style="s2">and justice are essential concepts they</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.750" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">are highly desirable and we should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.210" end="00:49:23.830" style="s2">much more careful about protecting them</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:27.460" style="s2">rather than allow markets and other</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.830" end="00:49:29.140" style="s2">things to endanger them and without</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.460" end="00:49:31.030" style="s2">being able to pull it up let me just say</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.140" end="00:49:34.210" style="s2">that the one of the papers that I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.030" end="00:49:36.250" style="s2">think of that looks at whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.210" end="00:49:39.460" style="s2">other organisms have a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.250" end="00:49:41.410" style="s2">fairness is I think it&#39;s chimps but it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.460" end="00:49:43.210" style="s2">might be some other species of monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.410" end="00:49:46.330" style="s2">and yes I&#39;m saying chimps or monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.210" end="00:49:49.210" style="s2">just like we&#39;re monkeys in which they</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.330" end="00:49:51.550" style="s2">are given they&#39;re given I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.210" end="00:49:53.350" style="s2">that given cucumbers you got two chimps</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.550" end="00:49:54.940" style="s2">or some other species of primate in</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.350" end="00:49:55.930" style="s2">cages next to each other so they can see</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.940" end="00:49:58.810" style="s2">each other they can see what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.930" end="00:50:00.580" style="s2">being being given by the researcher they</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.810" end="00:50:02.770" style="s2">given cucumbers which they like just</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.580" end="00:50:04.390" style="s2">fine but they prefer grapes and at some</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.770" end="00:50:05.800" style="s2">point one of them is given a grape and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.390" end="00:50:07.660" style="s2">the other one is given a cucumber and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.800" end="00:50:11.410" style="s2">the guy who&#39;s still getting cucumber</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.660" end="00:50:14.020" style="s2">sees that his conspecific is pure at</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.410" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s a friend has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.020" end="00:50:18.609" style="s2">a grape which he prefers and not only</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:19.930" style="s2">does he throw a fit but he actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.609" end="00:50:23.080" style="s2">throws the cucumber back at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.930" end="00:50:24.369" style="s2">researcher so he actually gives up the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.080" end="00:50:26.440" style="s2">thing that he was perfectly happy to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.369" end="00:50:29.020" style="s2">receive as a treat for doing something</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.440" end="00:50:31.660" style="s2">at the point that he perceives and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.020" end="00:50:33.400" style="s2">know imprecisely we can talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.660" end="00:50:34.119" style="s2">he perceives that he has experienced an</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.400" end="00:50:36.460" style="s2">injustice</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.119" end="00:50:38.380" style="s2">is there really a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.460" end="00:50:39.970" style="s2">justice and fairness in this regard I</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.380" end="00:50:42.280" style="s2">guess justice is sort of longer term</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.970" end="00:50:44.590" style="s2">it&#39;s more there&#39;s more architecture</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.280" end="00:50:46.099" style="s2">around it yeah I would say justice is</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.590" end="00:50:48.619" style="s2">the architected</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.099" end="00:50:51.890" style="s2">attempt to create a landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.619" end="00:50:53.869" style="s2">fairness yeah and I would say as good as</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.890" end="00:50:55.759" style="s2">cucumbers are they&#39;re not as good as</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.869" end="00:51:00.499" style="s2">grapes right exactly house every monkey</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.759" end="00:51:02.660" style="s2">knows believe me oh okay are you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.499" end="00:51:03.470" style="s2">familiar with the analysis oh wait we</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.660" end="00:51:10.279" style="s2">already read that one</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.470" end="00:51:14.089" style="s2">oh it&#39;s both Zac someone thinks I might</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.279" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">write over here yeah yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.089" end="00:51:19.099" style="s2">you&#39;re attractive but that&#39;s not me no</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:21.109" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not you know I left a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.099" end="00:51:22.759" style="s2">question mark off my previous superjet</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.109" end="00:51:25.700" style="s2">well thank you for contributing wait a</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.759" end="00:51:27.499" style="s2">second hey Zac your mom is super hot yo</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.700" end="00:51:27.979" style="s2">first of all why are you going through</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.499" end="00:51:30.910" style="s2">Zac&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.979" end="00:51:34.999" style="s2">second of all hot is not the right term</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.910" end="00:51:37.059" style="s2">beautiful yes but hot because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.999" end="00:51:41.210" style="s2">not right so we could we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.059" end="00:51:42.950" style="s2">another time um whoever filed that okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.210" end="00:51:47.239" style="s2">either knows or should go look it up</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.950" end="00:51:52.219" style="s2">okay do Coronis ours hybrids exist in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.239" end="00:51:56.930" style="s2">bats naturally that is a good question</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.219" end="00:51:59.359" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a site</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.930" end="00:52:01.519" style="s2">that I showed on earlier livestream that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:03.349" style="s2">that keeps track of all of the known</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.519" end="00:52:06.710" style="s2">corona viruses as well as all the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.349" end="00:52:14.150" style="s2">viruses and has a sort of an ad hoc</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.710" end="00:52:16.549" style="s2">phylogeny there&#39;s a whole lot of corona</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.150" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">viruses that are identified as being</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.549" end="00:52:21.430" style="s2">found in bats that are called</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">recombinant and it&#39;s totally unclear</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.430" end="00:52:27.410" style="s2">whether or not that means that they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">recombined in bats naturally or if these</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.410" end="00:52:31.940" style="s2">are recombinant viruses that have been</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:33.440" style="s2">created in labs and but but are still on</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.940" end="00:52:35.299" style="s2">the database of all the viruses out</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.440" end="00:52:38.299" style="s2">there I actually I got I got stuck here</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.299" end="00:52:40.849" style="s2">and it felt kind of alarming not to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.299" end="00:52:43.309" style="s2">able to figure out whether or not this</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.849" end="00:52:48.079" style="s2">this database of viruses is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.309" end="00:52:50.900" style="s2">a recognition that bat coronavirus is</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.079" end="00:52:52.759" style="s2">often recombine between species or if</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.900" end="00:52:53.519" style="s2">the only time that happens is through</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.759" end="00:52:55.739" style="s2">hee</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.519" end="00:52:59.699" style="s2">intervention yeah I must say the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.739" end="00:53:02.819" style="s2">question is phrased a little oddly do</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.699" end="00:53:07.919" style="s2">coronavirus hybrids exist in bats</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.819" end="00:53:09.809" style="s2">oh and SARS hybrid so sorry</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.919" end="00:53:13.829" style="s2">I guess SARS is redundant here because</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.809" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">SARS is just a syndrome yeah well its</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.829" end="00:53:18.779" style="s2">idioms right it&#39;s a syndrome descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:20.609" style="s2">of some classes of classes I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.779" end="00:53:23.429" style="s2">we know the answer to this question and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.609" end="00:53:25.829" style="s2">by we I&#39;d be interested if anybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.429" end="00:53:28.469" style="s2">but it would certainly be a useful</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.829" end="00:53:32.369" style="s2">mechanism to the viruses if they could</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.469" end="00:53:34.289" style="s2">recombine which doesn&#39;t make it possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.369" end="00:53:36.449" style="s2">and the key question is given the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.289" end="00:53:39.390" style="s2">these things function you have an RNA</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.449" end="00:53:41.549" style="s2">template that makes it into cells that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.390" end="00:53:45.869" style="s2">RNA template is read by ribosomes and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.549" end="00:53:48.209" style="s2">turned into proteins and is transcribed</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.869" end="00:53:51.029" style="s2">into another RNA strand that becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.209" end="00:53:52.919" style="s2">basis of new viruses so it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.029" end="00:53:55.619" style="s2">to me that that includes a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.919" end="00:53:57.959" style="s2">whereby recombination could happen but</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.619" end="00:54:00.089" style="s2">there could be some subsidiary set of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.959" end="00:54:01.319" style="s2">proteins that allows splicing especially</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.089" end="00:54:03.419" style="s2">in light of the fact these corona</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.319" end="00:54:08.359" style="s2">viruses appear to have error correction</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.419" end="00:54:10.919" style="s2">mm-hmm hybridization could actually be</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.199" end="00:54:40.229" style="s2">would say that you needn&#39;t you know in</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.229" end="00:54:47.519" style="s2">rural you do not inherently need to go</p>

<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:05.369" style="s2">but I certainly don&#39;t think it never</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.649" end="00:55:07.560" style="s2">occurred to me actually that go outside</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.369" end="00:55:10.350" style="s2">open natural areas imply</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.560" end="00:55:12.450" style="s2">that these are a inherently rural I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.350" end="00:55:14.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got a giant park very</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.450" end="00:55:16.470" style="s2">near us that&#39;s been closed for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.460" end="00:55:17.970" style="s2">of months and it&#39;s within Portland City</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.470" end="00:55:19.800" style="s2">Limits and your Portland itself has</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.970" end="00:55:21.450" style="s2">three of these giant parks and many</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.450" end="00:55:25.610" style="s2">within city limits so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.250" end="00:55:29.990" style="s2">inherently about rural versus urban</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.610" end="00:55:34.610" style="s2">environments and certainly you know on</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.990" end="00:55:38.340" style="s2">in coastal towns those aren&#39;t inherently</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.610" end="00:55:40.650" style="s2">rural areas either so I guess I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.340" end="00:55:42.690" style="s2">don&#39;t quite buy the dichotomy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.650" end="00:55:45.840" style="s2">framed here that you know further pits</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.690" end="00:55:49.320" style="s2">urban versus rural of coastal versus but</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.840" end="00:55:52.050" style="s2">all the country and yet there&#39;s a truth</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.320" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">in concern if you think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.050" end="00:55:55.980" style="s2">Manhattanites if we say you should go to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:57.630" style="s2">a Nature area we&#39;re definitely telling</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.980" end="00:56:00.660" style="s2">them to travel sure and so that would</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.630" end="00:56:03.060" style="s2">expose people outside so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.660" end="00:56:06.180" style="s2">has to be navigated carefully the fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.060" end="00:56:10.410" style="s2">is and you know that well and sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.180" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">apparently many sir the number but many</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.410" end="00:56:14.490" style="s2">many many people showed up in Georgia</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.770" style="s2">after they were the first state to open</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.490" end="00:56:18.570" style="s2">so exactly the game theoretic problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.770" end="00:56:20.100" style="s2">that you had been predicting and this</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.570" end="00:56:22.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t about natural areas opening it</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.100" end="00:56:24.750" style="s2">was about stages of opening that are out</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.680" end="00:56:26.040" style="s2">of sync with with their neighbors yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.750" end="00:56:28.770" style="s2">and so you know that will certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.040" end="00:56:31.260" style="s2">cause problems there will there will</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.770" end="00:56:33.060" style="s2">certainly be people who moved the virus</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.260" end="00:56:35.340" style="s2">from outside of Georgia into Georgia</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.060" end="00:56:38.520" style="s2">because Georgia opened and made itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.340" end="00:56:39.900" style="s2">look more more inviting to a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.520" end="00:56:42.000" style="s2">of people some of whom presumably are</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.900" end="00:56:43.700" style="s2">sick yeah so this problem exists at</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.000" end="00:56:46.590" style="s2">every every single layer and I would</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.700" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">object to the framing of open natural</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.590" end="00:56:50.460" style="s2">areas as an attack on the world yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:55.340" style="s2">think that&#39;s not though there is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.460" end="00:56:57.480" style="s2">something to be navigated yep - portugal</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.579" end="00:57:25.009" style="s2">what I would say is this is the best</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.039" end="00:57:27.619" style="s2">analogy I&#39;ve got so far if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.009" end="00:57:31.519" style="s2">what we are told functions underneath</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.630" end="00:57:48.349" style="s2">right it has an intermediate and what I</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.420" end="00:57:51.799" style="s2">would argue is the efficient way for me</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.349" end="00:57:54.469" style="s2">to take your perspective and put it</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.799" end="00:57:56.450" style="s2">side-by-side with my perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.469" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">figure out what I think in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.450" end="00:58:01.880" style="s2">sum is to create a space in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:05.539" style="s2">where you and I are both real right</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.880" end="00:58:07.219" style="s2">mm-hm and to unpack these things there</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.539" end="00:58:09.739" style="s2">and that you would have a parallel space</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.219" end="00:58:13.309" style="s2">and that the more similar your space and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.739" end="00:58:15.529" style="s2">my space were the more likely we were to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.309" end="00:58:17.569" style="s2">have a fruitful interaction between our</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.529" end="00:58:20.450" style="s2">different perspectives and so basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.569" end="00:58:22.849" style="s2">the point is there is no actual space</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.450" end="00:58:26.150" style="s2">between us where this happens but each</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.849" end="00:58:29.809" style="s2">of us have a mirror better or worse of</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.150" end="00:58:31.190" style="s2">the degree to which the perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.809" end="00:58:32.989" style="s2">shared and the degree to which the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.190" end="00:58:38.269" style="s2">perspectives differ that&#39;ll aoz us each</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.989" end="00:58:41.660" style="s2">to to compare the objects side-by-side</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.269" end="00:58:44.680" style="s2">and so the question really is if you did</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.660" end="00:58:47.209" style="s2">this as you say with the lights off</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.680" end="00:58:51.709" style="s2">where would it happen and in what form</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.209" end="00:58:53.449" style="s2">if you do it with a you know I have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.709" end="00:58:55.729" style="s2">model of me and I have a model of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.449" end="00:58:59.269" style="s2">and I exist in this subject space where</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.729" end="00:59:02.059" style="s2">things are perceived I at least know how</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.269" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">it works right so the question is did</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.059" end="00:59:08.749" style="s2">evolution create subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:10.999" style="s2">because it was the simplest mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.749" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">available to it for allowing an</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.670" end="01:01:12.290" style="s2">though that&#39;s right so okay that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.070" end="01:01:14.030" style="s2">response to an earlier question about</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.290" end="01:01:17.090" style="s2">whether or not there are any vaccines</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.030" end="01:01:21.140" style="s2">for coronaviruses yes and other species</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.090" end="01:01:24.230" style="s2">i we don&#39;t know of any in humans and of</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.140" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">course it could be a long time on to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.230" end="01:01:29.300" style="s2">never possibly before we have one for</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:30.680" style="s2">this particular one oh please please</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.300" end="01:01:32.270" style="s2">please do that systemic breakdown of</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.680" end="01:01:33.800" style="s2">planned emic that you mentioned you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.270" end="01:01:37.730" style="s2">the only honest and measured voices we</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.800" end="01:01:39.980" style="s2">can count on thank you um yeah we might</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.730" end="01:01:44.270" style="s2">we might do that the reason that we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.980" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">hesitant I just I I went down this</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.270" end="01:01:48.800" style="s2">rabbit hole between this the last</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">livestream and this one and I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.800" end="01:01:53.150" style="s2">pretty deeply plagued by it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:55.310" style="s2">nearly pulling my hair out coming to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.150" end="01:01:57.140" style="s2">going I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.310" end="01:01:59.390" style="s2">make of so many of the claims here and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.140" end="01:02:04.580" style="s2">know some are wrong I know some at least</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.390" end="01:02:06.890" style="s2">fit with my priors yeah and at some to</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.580" end="01:02:11.660" style="s2">some degree I think what we ended up</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.890" end="01:02:15.260" style="s2">deciding was it&#39;s such a mess it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.660" end="01:02:19.370" style="s2">almost like it was perfectly created to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.260" end="01:02:22.820" style="s2">make it impossible to assess which means</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.370" end="01:02:26.390" style="s2">that any investigation of it is high</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.820" end="01:02:29.540" style="s2">risk because if if it is inherently</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.390" end="01:02:31.370" style="s2">difficult to assess any number of things</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.540" end="01:02:32.990" style="s2">you know any number of signs could be</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.370" end="01:02:35.450" style="s2">flipped on any number of the logical</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.990" end="01:02:38.510" style="s2">pieces in the puzzle that you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.450" end="01:02:42.140" style="s2">to do so that&#39;s that&#39;s part of why we</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.510" end="01:02:44.750" style="s2">did not spend today doing it yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.140" end="01:02:47.690" style="s2">would just say the danger in doing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.750" end="01:02:50.330" style="s2">is that you&#39;re basically holding</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.690" end="01:02:53.240" style="s2">yourself responsible for finding the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.330" end="01:02:55.880" style="s2">borders between what is accurate and</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.240" end="01:02:56.840" style="s2">inaccurate rather than stepping back and</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.880" end="01:02:58.490" style="s2">saying there&#39;s a lot here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.840" end="01:03:00.460" style="s2">inaccurate that&#39;s enough to tell me that</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.490" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">this is not a straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.460" end="01:03:06.140" style="s2">revelation of the truth so if you hold</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:07.970" style="s2">yourself responsible for parsing those</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.140" end="01:03:13.460" style="s2">divisions and you get something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.970" end="01:03:14.990" style="s2">then you add fuel to the fire so I must</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.460" end="01:03:18.770" style="s2">say it might be worth doing and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.990" end="01:03:21.230" style="s2">we&#39;ll do it but it&#39;s not simple that it</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.770" end="01:03:22.970" style="s2">is the right move the recognition that</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.230" end="01:03:25.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot wrong with it</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.970" end="01:03:29.510" style="s2">already tells us if you can&#39;t get a half</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.970" end="01:03:31.430" style="s2">an hour basically right without a major</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.510" end="01:03:33.860" style="s2">error then there might be a reason for</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.430" end="01:03:36.590" style="s2">that yeah okay last question from</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.860" end="01:03:38.510" style="s2">Eleanor Rigby no less on the last</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.590" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">podcast you said that sex is a common</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.510" end="01:03:45.950" style="s2">breakfast conversation in your home is</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:48.340" style="s2">that regarding humans or lizards I do</p>

<p begin="01:04:01.020" end="01:04:08.040" style="s2">not like we sit down to breakfast and</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.550" end="01:04:10.650" style="s2">sex is that thing which we must talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.040" end="01:04:12.060" style="s2">about over our cereal is that mostly</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.650" end="01:04:14.970" style="s2">because we don&#39;t actually sit down at</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.060" end="01:04:16.680" style="s2">breakfast it&#39;s part of it yeah it would</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.970" end="01:04:18.180" style="s2">be more likely to be at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.680" end="01:04:19.890" style="s2">yeah the dinner table well it&#39;s</p>
