<p begin="00:00:20.180" end="00:00:27.150" style="s2">that I would say unfortunately is not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:32.310" style="s2">rare incident where I am couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.150" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">one of my socks so of course I start</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.310" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">doing this very familiar dance called</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:41.239" style="s2">looking for my sock at some point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:44.699" style="s2">kind of alerted by my wife Brianne</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.239" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">asking me what are you looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.699" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">all of a sudden I realize and I had this</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">kind of blank look on my face and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:58.710" style="s2">Brianne smiles and she&#39;s like you forgot</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:04.489" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking for didn&#39;t you this</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.489" end="00:01:08.540" style="s2">remembered oh I was looking for my sock</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.659" end="00:01:20.290" style="s2">he&#39;s funny because that strangely that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about that at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.290" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">edge of my awareness you know since</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:27.580" style="s2">since that happened yesterday and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:29.770" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.580" end="00:01:37.479" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that right that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.770" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">I think is speaks to something that I I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.479" end="00:01:43.450" style="s2">want to see if I can kind of tease out</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:46.390" style="s2">what it would it what&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.450" end="00:01:48.340" style="s2">disclosed in that right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.390" end="00:01:51.039" style="s2">it&#39;s funny right it&#39;s it&#39;s a funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.340" end="00:01:56.710" style="s2">because you know we you could say we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.039" end="00:01:58.690" style="s2">have this ability right to to look for</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.710" end="00:02:04.360" style="s2">something and start looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.690" end="00:02:07.330" style="s2">and in the process of looking for it not</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.360" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">notice that we&#39;ve forgotten what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.330" end="00:02:16.329" style="s2">looking for yet still be looking and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not that I you know in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.329" end="00:02:21.940" style="s2">moment when I&#39;m looking for my sock it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:23.500" style="s2">not like I&#39;m present to not knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.940" end="00:02:25.630" style="s2">I was looking for cuz if I were I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.500" end="00:02:27.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be looking I&#39;d be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.630" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">about what the hell I was looking for no</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.940" end="00:02:40.060" style="s2">there&#39;s this little period of time right</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.630" end="00:02:44.890" style="s2">where I&#39;m looking and it&#39;s it&#39;s lost to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.060" end="00:02:47.549" style="s2">me that I&#39;ve lost what I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.890" end="00:02:47.549" style="s2">it&#39;s concealed</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.180" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been thinking about like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">know it&#39;s funny it&#39;s it&#39;s what else is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">that like you know this ability to on</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:07.859" style="s2">some level to be on our way towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:10.439" style="s2">something which is you know on some</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.859" end="00:03:16.139" style="s2">level that&#39;s what it is to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.439" end="00:03:17.639" style="s2">we&#39;re always on our way somewhere always</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.139" end="00:03:25.139" style="s2">on our way somewhere we&#39;re always coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.639" end="00:03:29.819" style="s2">from somewhere and it seems that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.139" end="00:03:35.639" style="s2">a way in which what has us what calls us</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.819" end="00:03:38.340" style="s2">into being on our way in a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.639" end="00:03:45.950" style="s2">level can be concealed to us and it can</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:51.569" style="s2">be concealed that is concealed and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.950" end="00:03:55.349" style="s2">imagine this is what in us in a in a in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.569" end="00:04:01.489" style="s2">a way is what you know the Greeks really</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.349" end="00:04:05.159" style="s2">meant by the term Alafaya or ilithyia</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.489" end="00:04:07.319" style="s2">which is the okay you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.159" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">primordial notion of truth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.319" end="00:04:12.989" style="s2">really interesting because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:18.060" style="s2">truth as we usually think of it now</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.989" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">which is correctness right where when</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.060" end="00:04:24.659" style="s2">the something like the word and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:26.310" style="s2">object align up the idea of the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.659" end="00:04:28.349" style="s2">the object of the world light not they</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.310" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">correlate and we call that true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.349" end="00:04:32.849" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">correct yet you know that as the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.849" end="00:04:40.259" style="s2">do have a much more primordial notion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">truth which is the you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.259" end="00:04:52.150" style="s2">happening the event the the moment where</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:57.259" style="s2">that which is veiled hidden</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.150" end="00:04:58.580" style="s2">becomes revealed right in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.259" end="00:05:00.020" style="s2">interesting because for the longest time</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.580" end="00:05:02.810" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.020" end="00:05:06.680" style="s2">ilithyia for a long time because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.810" end="00:05:09.710" style="s2">seems to me that right that the that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">when we have it&#39;s always struck me that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.710" end="00:05:15.949" style="s2">that this kind of double this double</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:17.509" style="s2">experience of personal insights that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.949" end="00:05:20.840" style="s2">would have and then I&#39;d be in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.509" end="00:05:23.960" style="s2">presence of people having you know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.840" end="00:05:25.639" style="s2">and my work and stuff it&#39;s always struck</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.960" end="00:05:27.259" style="s2">by this kind of double sense where</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.639" end="00:05:29.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like an insight means like you</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.259" end="00:05:33.289" style="s2">see something new but you also reveal if</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.960" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">it&#39;s an insight that which was already</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.289" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">the case but concealed from you and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:46.659" style="s2">when I started understanding this term</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:50.919" style="s2">Alafaya as truth I think there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.659" end="00:05:53.389" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that really spoke to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.919" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">but the thing about that is like for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.389" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">at first I thought well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:02.689" style="s2">about what&#39;s revealed right so there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:06.169" style="s2">something hidden and it&#39;s revealed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.689" end="00:06:07.699" style="s2">like the truth is what is revealed but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.169" end="00:06:16.430" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.699" end="00:06:22.009" style="s2">I think this sense of looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.430" end="00:06:24.430" style="s2">sock that was concealed that I had</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.009" end="00:06:29.930" style="s2">totally forgotten it but yet was still</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:31.909" style="s2">given by then the the the forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.930" end="00:06:35.870" style="s2">looking for sickness I was still looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.909" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">for it right this ability to to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.870" end="00:06:45.050" style="s2">constituted great to be characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">such a activity and be completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.050" end="00:06:51.139" style="s2">consistent have it be completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:53.910" style="s2">concealed right speaks to this in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.139" end="00:06:57.000" style="s2">funny way right</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.910" end="00:06:59.960" style="s2">where you know it&#39;s I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.000" end="00:07:05.850" style="s2">word comes from lazy it comes from the B</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.960" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">the Greek myth I think it&#39;s a river or a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.850" end="00:07:12.750" style="s2">lake and it&#39;s considered lay Thea I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.130" end="00:07:16.140" style="s2">consider the river or the lake of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.750" end="00:07:21.090" style="s2">forgetfulness so to get a sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.140" end="00:07:23.700" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s forgetfulness so you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.090" end="00:07:26.970" style="s2">if I&#39;m guys walking along and he trips</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.700" end="00:07:28.890" style="s2">and falls into lake lake here it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.970" end="00:07:34.200" style="s2">like people are like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.890" end="00:07:40.860" style="s2">where&#39;s guy no it&#39;s guy becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.200" end="00:07:45.090" style="s2">forgotten right and so it&#39;s missing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.860" end="00:07:48.570" style="s2">guy&#39;s missing it&#39;s forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.090" end="00:07:54.170" style="s2">that guy is forgotten total concealment</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.570" end="00:07:58.430" style="s2">so Alethea is not the realization of guy</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.170" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">that that is the case but the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:08:07.170" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s really disclosed right</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:08.670" style="s2">is the recognition that it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.170" end="00:08:11.220" style="s2">completely concealed to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.670" end="00:08:16.590" style="s2">it&#39;s that that&#39;s the thing that evokes</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.220" end="00:08:20.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the uncanny &#39;no so that of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.590" end="00:08:23.490" style="s2">deeply that can feel this is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.700" end="00:08:25.830" style="s2">strange thing to try to put words to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.490" end="00:08:33.330" style="s2">however I think it&#39;s worth it because</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.830" end="00:08:40.219" style="s2">and some level it just seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.330" end="00:08:40.219" style="s2">seems like that&#39;s kind of where being is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.329" end="00:08:59.019" style="s2">and this also strikes me the more modern</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.829" end="00:09:07.459" style="s2">we are the less and less that sense this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.019" end="00:09:15.319" style="s2">sensitivity to the nothing to the edge</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.459" end="00:09:19.339" style="s2">of our intelligibility let we have less</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.319" end="00:09:25.940" style="s2">and less of a sense for this nothing for</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.339" end="00:09:30.279" style="s2">this not yet on some level it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.940" end="00:09:38.209" style="s2">anonymous one that sits before under</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.279" end="00:09:39.860" style="s2">within everything else and little</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.209" end="00:09:41.959" style="s2">moments like that right little</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.860" end="00:09:48.829" style="s2">little moments like that reveals this</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.959" end="00:09:51.730" style="s2">kind of uncanny this of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.829" end="00:09:51.730" style="s2">deeply silent</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.830" end="00:10:03.899" style="s2">so having ears having eyes having you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.190" end="00:10:08.250" style="s2">know what is it to be become sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.899" end="00:10:13.079" style="s2">to be struck by those little moments of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.250" end="00:10:16.230" style="s2">wear concealment reveals itself and I</p>
