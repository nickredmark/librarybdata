<p begin="00:01:34.100" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">very difficult to pin down exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">an instinct is the notion of instinct</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">pushing outwards into the world is quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">interesting and so it&#39;s something to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:50.659" style="s2">with the way with which we interface</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">with the world and instincts has a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.659" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">connotation of being embedded somehow</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:01:58.260" style="s2">right that you&#39;ll sort of stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:02.400" style="s2">your instincts can you instinct be</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.260" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">modified can you learn instincts or our</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.400" end="00:02:07.080" style="s2">instincts that you sort of stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.530" style="s2">them you can manage them but but but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.080" end="00:02:09.530" style="s2">have what you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.190" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">instincts like magnetic poles being</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">our instincts maybe do not lie within</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.640" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">but actually lie without that a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">call is happening from the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">beckoning us to form some kind of dance</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">to perform some kind of dance to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:57.140" style="s2">interact with the world in a specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:03:02.730" style="s2">way great distant forces being</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.140" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">actualized here now in the present</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.730" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">moment that&#39;s very interesting instinct</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">not as standalone things but as part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">a system a way of speaking to a form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:27.390" style="s2">language communication sets with</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">external reality so that&#39;s that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.390" end="00:03:36.200" style="s2">interesting that the coupling of so an</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:39.480" style="s2">instinct emerges as a consequence of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.200" end="00:03:43.790" style="s2">need for that instinct to emerge being</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.480" end="00:03:43.790" style="s2">presented in the environment and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.030" end="00:03:53.580" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.049" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">so what we have in us then are like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.580" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">seeds of instinct waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:05.850" style="s2">activated by being alive and being</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">active in an environment something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.850" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2">that instinct to breathe only possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">when there is a continual source of life</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:30.270" style="s2">to nourish first the fetus</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">and then the newborn the oxygen for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:38.670" style="s2">breath to happen one half within one</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:44.420" style="s2">heart without this poor desire to pull</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.670" end="00:04:50.690" style="s2">in or his outside transmute it within</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.420" end="00:04:50.690" style="s2">and then to give back to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.380" end="00:05:00.420" style="s2">does the universe have an instinct</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.490" end="00:05:08.340" style="s2">towards greater complexity which a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.420" end="00:05:12.390" style="s2">deeper entropy to the lifelessness hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.340" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">very interesting it seems like it might</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.390" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">be interesting to explore the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.300" end="00:05:23.480" style="s2">between instinct and tendency instinct</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:29.820" style="s2">and intuition instinct and reflex</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.480" end="00:05:33.770" style="s2">instinct and I don&#39;t know other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.820" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">autonomic type reactions to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.770" end="00:05:37.950" style="s2">circumstances in the environment where</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:41.970" style="s2">are the boundaries between these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.950" end="00:05:47.640" style="s2">is instinct maybe oh is instinct maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.970" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">the participate or II knowing and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.640" end="00:05:53.510" style="s2">stacks on top of that moving up when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:55.950" style="s2">get to the propositional that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.510" end="00:05:57.540" style="s2">intuition is it maybe something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:06:03.050" style="s2">that is that is there some way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.540" end="00:06:03.050" style="s2">putting it into Vevey keys framework</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.910" end="00:06:16.230" style="s2">instinct as deep biological wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.390" end="00:06:18.330" style="s2">sourced from the beginning of time when</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.230" end="00:06:20.820" style="s2">the first life was born how to stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.330" end="00:06:24.930" style="s2">alive how to stay alive - their lives</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.820" end="00:06:26.640" style="s2">the question of the instincts figuring</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.930" end="00:06:29.430" style="s2">out by any means how to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.640" end="00:06:32.419" style="s2">life-form lifing to keep this life-form</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.850" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">instinct arising life being born may be</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:56.700" style="s2">a blank no knowledge just physical pause</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:59.790" style="s2">and drifts and sways and remembering</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.700" end="00:07:03.270" style="s2">which sways and pulls and pushes worked</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.790" end="00:07:13.980" style="s2">the best and saving them for future</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:18.810" style="s2">generations so instincts are linked to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.980" end="00:07:21.540" style="s2">our deep ancestry if they&#39;ve evolved</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.810" end="00:07:28.140" style="s2">over large amounts of time they are also</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.540" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">linked to our ancestry it also if you if</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.140" end="00:07:33.960" style="s2">if one strips down instinct to being an</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:37.020" style="s2">instinct for survival that there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.960" end="00:07:41.070" style="s2">actually only one instinct that that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.020" end="00:07:43.530" style="s2">that is to survive and that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.070" end="00:07:47.550" style="s2">other things which have become instincts</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.530" end="00:07:50.550" style="s2">are modest on modifications hacks of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.550" end="00:07:53.670" style="s2">that basic instinct for survival which</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.550" end="00:07:56.130" style="s2">then manifests as an instinctive grouse</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.670" end="00:07:58.440" style="s2">Awards sunlight for example because</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.130" end="00:08:02.450" style="s2">appliance chances of survival are better</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.440" end="00:08:07.980" style="s2">if it is able to do that but I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.450" end="00:08:10.620" style="s2">is there&#39;s a single root two instinct on</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.980" end="00:08:16.260" style="s2">the origin of life from multiple origins</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.620" end="00:08:19.729" style="s2">of life multiple branches on the life</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.260" end="00:08:27.499" style="s2">tree or what point is there</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.749" end="00:08:40.269" style="s2">online what kind of phase shifts happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.120" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">instincts what happens when we finally</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.269" end="00:08:50.120" style="s2">access the tino global scale and rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">our instincts this thing&#39;s rewriting</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.120" end="00:08:59.470" style="s2">instinct that what&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.470" style="s2">present prevent us from going extinct</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.130" end="00:09:10.010" style="s2">rewriting the code of life rewriting our</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.990" end="00:09:13.100" style="s2">destinies is that even possible to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.010" end="00:09:16.430" style="s2">rewrite instincts bring them into</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.100" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">awareness and manage them</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.740" end="00:09:39.620" style="s2">code and yeah rewriting that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:49.579" style="s2">an impossible task there&#39;s maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.620" end="00:09:53.480" style="s2">value in the idea of a switch of focus</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.579" end="00:10:00.279" style="s2">to not quite such slow code when</p>
