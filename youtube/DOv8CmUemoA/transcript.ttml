<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:03.840" style="s2">alright guys so just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.010" end="00:00:05.130" style="s2">background as to what this the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:07.200" style="s2">context of what I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.130" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">today because I suspect it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.200" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">anything you&#39;ve seen before or probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:16.740" style="s2">not in this context - well first is I</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">actually started my first company in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.740" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">1998 and then took my last company</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">public in 2007 three different companies</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">so I had an opportunity to experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">the rise of the dot-com bubble the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:31.560" style="s2">decline of the dot-com bubble the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">death afterwards the rise of the 2006</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">frenzy the financial crisis all while</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">actually at the helm of a startup</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">company so the key message is macro</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">forces can impact your fate no matter</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:44.360" style="s2">how good you are so we&#39;re gonna talk a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">little bit about that from the top down</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.360" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">the second is that for some reason over</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">the past two decades I seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">gotten interested in things well in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">advance of those things becoming</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:58.850" style="s2">interesting to lots of other people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">definitely harkens back to my nerd</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.850" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">beginnings but also a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:05.489" style="s2">sort of an obsessive effort to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">understand the sort of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">reality at a fundamental level and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">logically things fall out of that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">seem obvious that they&#39;ll sort of emerge</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">in reality and then they do so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">try to give you essentially my operating</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">model of what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">and for some of you this may it could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">a complete waste of time and if so just</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:27.689" style="s2">try to snore quietly for others this may</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">be really awesome so I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.689" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">those folks get their money&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">so what I&#39;m to begin with is some</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">foundational assumptions try to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">get everybody on the same page about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">nature of how this big picture thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">called the world works the first is one</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">that I had to deal with a lot in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">early part of my career which is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">concept that history happens I remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">being in a meeting with the chairman of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">EMI us when I was probably about 26 and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">I tried to explain to him earnestly that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">the music industry as he knew it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">already dead and the only choice he</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">really had was to figure out what his</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:02.780" style="s2">new model is gonna look like and he sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:05.549" style="s2">of glazed over and had no capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.780" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">can consider this right it wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.549" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">even necessary that he didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">but that the idea that the world that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:13.739" style="s2">had grown up in could suddenly and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">a change wasn&#39;t part of his operating</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.739" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">model so the key idea here is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">history happens you know falls</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">apart big time absolutely anything that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:26.069" style="s2">currently exists will at some point no</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">longer exist</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.069" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">second this is the key idea by the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:32.459" style="s2">if you get this slide you get a lot it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">seems to happen all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.459" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">through something called punctuated</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">equilibrium all right s curves you see s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">curves all the time and economics tremor</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:40.769" style="s2">two curves disruption waves things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.269" end="00:02:42.660" style="s2">that but frankly we see them all over</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.769" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">the place and we see them in the you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">know the the breaking of dams the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">lightning bolt striking we see them in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">population growth to see them all over</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:54.230" style="s2">the place and the key message of an S</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">curve is this notion of it starts slow</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.230" end="00:02:58.140" style="s2">most people have no idea it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">at all and frankly has very little</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.140" end="00:03:02.549" style="s2">impact on the world and then at some</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">point for some reason it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.549" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">become more material and starts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:08.250" style="s2">accelerate at this point it becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:10.049" style="s2">hot new thing all right the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.250" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">revolution the new wave whatever happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.049" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">to be around here it is simply the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">thing it&#39;s the new standard it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:18.269" style="s2">happens then over at this point</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">it becomes the model that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.269" end="00:03:21.660" style="s2">thinks is the nature of reality and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">never going to change again up here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.660" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">lost its innovative potential it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">extractive it just kind of goes along</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">for as long as it&#39;s relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:32.519" style="s2">typically by the way tends to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:34.019" style="s2">as the next one comes along alright so</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.519" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">think about these things in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.019" end="00:03:38.040" style="s2">waves if it doesn&#39;t seem like anybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.209" end="00:03:39.900" style="s2">really knows about what&#39;s going on but</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.040" end="00:03:43.350" style="s2">you feel like it&#39;s super important you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.900" end="00:03:44.790" style="s2">might be over over here and then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.350" end="00:03:46.590" style="s2">have to think okay where am I on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.790" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">curve if you&#39;re way over on the left of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.590" end="00:03:49.350" style="s2">the curve you&#39;re probably not gonna win</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">any time immediately as soon it&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.350" end="00:03:52.739" style="s2">a while there&#39;s gonna be a lot of forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">protected against you so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.739" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">take a strategy that takes that into</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">account if on the other hand things feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">like they&#39;re getting ready to pop then</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">you need a position for that as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">okay now these waves appear everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">in society and everywhere it means</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:10.250" style="s2">everywhere right so whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">talking about fashion or education or</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.250" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">sexual activity family technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">finance money government every single</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:21.060" style="s2">aspect of reality and particularly human</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:22.590" style="s2">society proceeds by the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.060" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">lots and lots of different waves that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.590" end="00:04:26.050" style="s2">feedback on each other and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">impact each other let&#39;s take for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.050" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">the rise of the miniskirt this was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:32.229" style="s2">historical event but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">combination of let&#39;s see what I tracked</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.229" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">down I did the research significant</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:39.610" style="s2">changes in textile manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">technology an economic shift towards the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.610" end="00:04:44.610" style="s2">middle class post-war focus on youth and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:46.990" style="s2">youth culture the women&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.610" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">changes in media and the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.990" end="00:04:50.740" style="s2">different kinds of new media all happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">simultaneously and they all overlapped</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.740" end="00:04:55.449" style="s2">to cause this to happen and when this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:57.150" style="s2">happened it fed back on everything else</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.449" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">all rights what you get is an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.150" end="00:05:00.850" style="s2">complex interference pattern multiple</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:06.220" style="s2">different waves interacting with each</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.850" end="00:05:07.870" style="s2">other ok so that&#39;s the background that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.220" end="00:05:11.340" style="s2">the basic ideas some themes some</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.870" end="00:05:14.590" style="s2">concepts the key point now is right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.340" end="00:05:16.419" style="s2">several really really big waves are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.590" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">converging and they&#39;re beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.419" end="00:05:21.190" style="s2">become constructive interference they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:22.900" style="s2">adding together I&#39;ve just got a few here</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.190" end="00:05:24.310" style="s2">there&#39;s many more right and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.900" end="00:05:28.260" style="s2">but the key message is lots and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.310" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">big globalization right somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.260" end="00:05:32.979" style="s2">1988 or so the expansion in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:35.320" style="s2">inclusion of almost all of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.979" end="00:05:37.090" style="s2">a single unified system hit and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.320" end="00:05:39.699" style="s2">starting to feed back on itself write</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.980" end="00:06:45.040" style="s2">relevant to a lot of the things that</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.780" end="00:06:54.280" style="s2">that means for a very very big way and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.050" end="00:06:55.900" style="s2">very big waves have very big effects so</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.280" end="00:06:57.550" style="s2">the proposition that I&#39;m gonna make is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.900" end="00:07:00.220" style="s2">that we are already and have been for</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.550" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">some time in the middle of a crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.220" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">truly historical proportions right how</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:06.940" style="s2">big I tend to think we&#39;re sort of in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:09.580" style="s2">thousand year to 10,000 year equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.940" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">cycle I so think about the fall of Rome</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.580" end="00:07:14.050" style="s2">right the complete collapse of Western</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.510" style="s2">civilization to the Dark Ages or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.050" end="00:07:19.180" style="s2">the emergence of civilization itself in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.510" end="00:07:21.220" style="s2">the Fertile Crescent 10,000 15,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.180" end="00:07:22.450" style="s2">ago that&#39;s the level that we got to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.220" end="00:07:23.470" style="s2">thinking about alright so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.450" end="00:07:25.870" style="s2">thinking about things that happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.470" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">instead of 10 50 year cycles that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.870" end="00:07:30.190" style="s2">but just be aware of the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:33.490" style="s2">wave may come right value faster than</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">you can imagine and I don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.490" end="00:07:36.460" style="s2">you guys are from I happen to be from</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:38.050" style="s2">Southern California so surfing waves is</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.460" end="00:07:39.340" style="s2">one of the things that we do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.050" end="00:07:41.080" style="s2">very fair to say that my primary</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.340" end="00:07:42.910" style="s2">business acumen has been finding waves</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.080" end="00:07:45.040" style="s2">spotted them and paddling into them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.910" end="00:07:46.450" style="s2">usually very early so other guys end up</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.040" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">getting sort of all the all the big wins</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.450" end="00:07:51.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s kind of fun alright so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:55.540" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at then is a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.670" end="00:07:57.610" style="s2">global in scale civilization level</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.540" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">collapse and what I mean by civilization</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.610" end="00:08:02.320" style="s2">is civilization is the complete toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:05.320" style="s2">all the sets of institutions concepts</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.320" end="00:08:07.690" style="s2">processes models behaviors that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.320" end="00:08:09.070" style="s2">enculturated ourselves into to do all</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.690" end="00:08:10.480" style="s2">the things that we need to do as humans</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.070" end="00:08:12.070" style="s2">might the way we feed ourselves the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.480" end="00:08:13.300" style="s2">we groom ourselves when we find mates</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.070" end="00:08:15.340" style="s2">all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.300" end="00:08:16.210" style="s2">and it&#39;s comprehensive its global all</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.340" end="00:08:18.460" style="s2">across because everything&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.210" end="00:08:20.770" style="s2">entrained and they&#39;re all been being</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.460" end="00:08:21.970" style="s2">rendered obsolete either because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.770" end="00:08:24.280" style="s2">world has changed more rapid than they</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.970" end="00:08:25.990" style="s2">can handle or because they themselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.280" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">have become dysfunctional I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.990" end="00:08:30.010" style="s2">to go into too much depth on that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:31.390" style="s2">these sorts of things always happen in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.010" end="00:08:33.340" style="s2">the same way right they started to weak</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.390" end="00:08:34.780" style="s2">and go towards the center in this case</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.340" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">they&#39;re starting at the edge and working</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.780" end="00:08:39.550" style="s2">towards the core so briefly things at</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:41.560" style="s2">the edge</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.550" end="00:08:43.780" style="s2">I remember when journalism was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.560" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">newspapers in television that&#39;s the edge</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.780" end="00:08:48.970" style="s2">that was a very weak spot in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">existing legacy system and went digital</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.970" end="00:08:51.579" style="s2">very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:52.930" style="s2">journalism largely has already gone</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.579" end="00:08:54.459" style="s2">through the transition and most</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.930" end="00:08:58.089" style="s2">journalism now happens in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.459" end="00:08:59.259" style="s2">would have made Cronkite have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.089" end="00:09:02.230" style="s2">what&#39;s going on right</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.259" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">by contrast harder things are at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.230" end="00:09:05.709" style="s2">core these things are gonna take longer</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:07.689" style="s2">and they&#39;re at the the last things to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.709" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">disrupt and as they disrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.689" end="00:09:13.720" style="s2">consequences are more significant all</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:16.449" style="s2">right so one money money turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.720" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">have been a fundamental component of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.449" end="00:09:19.300" style="s2">major legacy institutions that are part</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.339" style="s2">of our current temporary global</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.300" end="00:09:22.839" style="s2">civilization and not just the form of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.339" end="00:09:25.089" style="s2">money the institution is around it the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.839" end="00:09:27.970" style="s2">way we use it we use it to decide and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.089" end="00:09:29.410" style="s2">make coordinate behavior and as we know</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.970" end="00:09:32.050" style="s2">certainly everybody here knows I saw the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.410" end="00:09:33.490" style="s2">sign out front money is now well into</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.050" end="00:09:35.379" style="s2">the disruptive wave right maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.490" end="00:09:36.850" style="s2">early majority level most people around</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.379" end="00:09:38.740" style="s2">the world are now beginning to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.850" end="00:09:41.199" style="s2">the fact that money is not magic it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.740" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">didn&#39;t come from God people make it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.199" end="00:09:44.139" style="s2">people can change it right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.490" end="00:09:46.439" style="s2">pretty significant psychological change</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.139" end="00:09:49.300" style="s2">from where it was 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.439" end="00:09:51.069" style="s2">governance and I was here actually why I</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.300" end="00:09:52.870" style="s2">got invited to this talk talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.069" end="00:09:55.569" style="s2">the fact that governance is just really</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.870" end="00:09:57.430" style="s2">entering into the disruption way and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.569" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">governance is like how we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.430" end="00:10:01.569" style="s2">make decisions about the Worr sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:03.579" style="s2">things that we do whether that&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.569" end="00:10:04.930" style="s2">corporation and corporate governance in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.579" end="00:10:06.670" style="s2">the way that we make decisions or at an</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.930" end="00:10:08.980" style="s2">organizational level or big-picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.670" end="00:10:11.259" style="s2">governance like you know the I will say</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.980" end="00:10:13.899" style="s2">right now on record that within 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.259" end="00:10:15.670" style="s2">the nation state as a fundamental unit</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.899" end="00:10:17.559" style="s2">of global political power will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.670" end="00:10:19.240" style="s2">subordinate it won&#39;t go away completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.559" end="00:10:21.430" style="s2">but there will be other forces that will</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.240" end="00:10:22.899" style="s2">be more important in deciding the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.430" end="00:10:27.009" style="s2">allocation of resources and the move</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.899" end="00:10:29.230" style="s2">into people at a global level and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.009" end="00:10:31.569" style="s2">the last is fundamental operating models</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.230" end="00:10:33.220" style="s2">this is more abstract deeper stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.569" end="00:10:34.420" style="s2">have to read things like Foucault and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.220" end="00:10:36.850" style="s2">Judah Louise to kind of get a better</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:39.459" style="s2">sense of it but these are the the ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.850" end="00:10:41.379" style="s2">the toolkits that we have for going out</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.459" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">and getting things done so for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.379" end="00:10:45.930" style="s2">in the contemporary environment after</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:48.339" style="s2">World War Two kind of the Six Sigma</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.930" end="00:10:49.449" style="s2">bureaucratic hierarchy is an operating</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.339" end="00:10:50.829" style="s2">model it&#39;s how you can get things done</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.449" end="00:10:51.939" style="s2">we got pretty good at it right it put us</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.829" end="00:10:54.459" style="s2">on the moon and built the interstate</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.939" end="00:10:57.069" style="s2">highway system this stuff is getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.459" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">thrown out all the way and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.069" end="00:11:00.309" style="s2">significant things around completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:02.319" style="s2">deconstructing the model of even like</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.309" end="00:11:02.760" style="s2">the corporation is almost certainly on</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.319" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.760" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">in fact again I&#39;d go ahead and predict</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:08.940" style="s2">that the form of corporation that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.230" style="s2">seen for the past hundred years is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.940" end="00:11:13.080" style="s2">almost certainly on its way out and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.230" end="00:11:14.190" style="s2">probably in the next 20 years so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.080" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">big stuff right those are major</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.190" end="00:11:18.750" style="s2">disruptions the key message is not only</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:19.950" style="s2">they big but as they disrupt starting at</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.750" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">the outside and working their way in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.950" end="00:11:23.750" style="s2">they bring widths and lots and lots and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:26.210" style="s2">lots of other stuff so think for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.750" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">you guys are familiar the TPP the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.210" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">trans-pacific partnership it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:34.620" style="s2">international law on trade so in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.510" style="s2">ways I mean it&#39;s a big trade but in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.620" end="00:11:38.730" style="s2">ways certain chunks of it started all</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.510" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">the way back in 1997 when I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.730" end="00:11:42.900" style="s2">involved in the mp3 movement because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:44.850" style="s2">mp3 movement was hitting a very weak</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.900" end="00:11:46.710" style="s2">spot which was the music industry they</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.850" end="00:11:47.820" style="s2">were very very weak right very easy for</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.710" end="00:11:49.590" style="s2">them to be disrupted in fact they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.820" end="00:11:51.990" style="s2">disrupted almost instantaneously except</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.590" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">for one thing they all had really strong</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.990" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">relationships with governance the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">music industry had very tight</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">relationships with legislature with with</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.430" style="s2">judges and so that&#39;s what they held on</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:04.170" style="s2">to and what they did is that pull all</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.430" end="00:12:05.820" style="s2">the destructive energy that was pointing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.170" end="00:12:07.950" style="s2">at the music industry at a market level</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.820" end="00:12:09.000" style="s2">and put that energy onto the legislative</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.950" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">level and they&#39;ve been fighting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.000" end="00:12:12.090" style="s2">copyright battles ever since for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:13.650" style="s2">past decade and a half and other guys</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.090" end="00:12:15.330" style="s2">have gotten into it as their business</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.650" end="00:12:17.730" style="s2">models have been threatened and a big</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.330" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">chunk of the TPP is in fact a leveling</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.730" end="00:12:22.500" style="s2">up of governance playing the game of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:25.290" style="s2">defending older models okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.500" end="00:12:27.210" style="s2">and as governance itself then is put on</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.290" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">the table and as it begins to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.210" end="00:12:31.620" style="s2">disrupted giant chunks of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">begin to change relatively rapidly you</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.620" end="00:12:33.840" style="s2">know the blockchain stuff is blowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:35.340" style="s2">people&#39;s minds they&#39;ve already been</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.840" end="00:12:37.100" style="s2">engaged in several conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.340" end="00:12:40.410" style="s2">folks who are offering the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.100" end="00:12:42.930" style="s2">jurisdiction innovation I go to some</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.410" end="00:12:45.900" style="s2">local jurisdiction but sovereign nation</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.930" end="00:12:47.940" style="s2">they will modify their laws to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.900" end="00:12:49.890" style="s2">for particular business models that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.940" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">not legal in other kinds of nation</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.890" end="00:12:53.280" style="s2">states that the blockchain can really</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:55.590" style="s2">take great advantage of and you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.280" end="00:12:58.050" style="s2">think of thousands actually even just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.590" end="00:13:00.150" style="s2">few seconds and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.050" end="00:13:01.740" style="s2">international legal structure do with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.150" end="00:13:04.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s really hard to say it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.740" end="00:13:06.660" style="s2">gonna be interesting and disruptive but</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.680" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing if I&#39;m right and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.660" end="00:13:10.500" style="s2">actually going in through a level of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.250" end="00:13:12.570" style="s2">thousand ten thousand year disruption it</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.500" end="00:13:14.490" style="s2">goes even deeper than that the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.570" end="00:13:15.840" style="s2">physical layer of the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.490" end="00:13:17.970" style="s2">structures that we use to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.840" end="00:13:19.860" style="s2">things like the way we do governance the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.970" end="00:13:21.390" style="s2">way we do business is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.860" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">candy coating on the outside or the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.390" end="00:13:25.170" style="s2">things we actually need to have done so</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:26.990" style="s2">this is a map of what the core really</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.170" end="00:13:29.640" style="s2">looks like you&#39;ve got things like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.990" end="00:13:31.380" style="s2">politics art medicine you&#39;re the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.640" end="00:13:33.720" style="s2">general categories of what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.380" end="00:13:35.580" style="s2">need to have done and inside that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.720" end="00:13:37.530" style="s2">actually the deep human needs that every</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.580" end="00:13:39.840" style="s2">that emerged that these things emerge</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.530" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">from like the need for identity they</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.840" end="00:13:42.870" style="s2">need to deal with the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:44.820" style="s2">gonna die the need to have ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.870" end="00:13:46.860" style="s2">creativity right these are the core</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.820" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">things that you know unless the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.860" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">transhumanist stuff really takes off</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.440" style="s2">these are probably not going to change</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:54.780" style="s2">in this way so we&#39;ll end up happening is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.440" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">that new things are going to clothe them</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.780" end="00:13:58.650" style="s2">and this is like the core this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">source of raw energy people need to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.650" end="00:14:03.270" style="s2">these things satisfied and as old models</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.750" end="00:14:05.190" style="s2">go away these ma these things need to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.270" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">satisfied so new models build up around</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.190" end="00:14:08.400" style="s2">them and they build up around them in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">very complex fashion you take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.400" end="00:14:11.400" style="s2">your history about how these things have</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:13.530" style="s2">happened in the past you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.400" end="00:14:15.030" style="s2">and sometimes things like medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.530" end="00:14:16.890" style="s2">religion are part of the same structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.030" end="00:14:19.140" style="s2">and sometimes they&#39;ll break apart and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.890" end="00:14:20.760" style="s2">they&#39;ll be very different sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.140" end="00:14:24.420" style="s2">family and law are the same structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.760" end="00:14:25.800" style="s2">right so at the core what I think right</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.420" end="00:14:28.230" style="s2">now is that we could be looking at three</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.800" end="00:14:28.740" style="s2">big ones one is identity you know who</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.230" end="00:14:30.420" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.740" end="00:14:32.130" style="s2">what does it mean to be you what does it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.420" end="00:14:35.100" style="s2">mean to be understood in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.130" end="00:14:37.200" style="s2">other kinds of identities the second is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.100" end="00:14:38.700" style="s2">sense making how do you make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.200" end="00:14:40.080" style="s2">the world what the hell is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.700" end="00:14:42.210" style="s2">how do I behave in this environment and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.080" end="00:14:43.620" style="s2">the third is meaning and what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.210" end="00:14:45.840" style="s2">actually important what is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.620" end="00:14:49.350" style="s2">where are places where I ought to where</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.840" end="00:14:50.610" style="s2">I should put my energy in my focus those</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.350" end="00:14:52.670" style="s2">answers those things those questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:55.830" style="s2">have really easy simple answers in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.670" end="00:14:57.060" style="s2">mature coherent cultures right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.830" end="00:14:58.920" style="s2">they&#39;re falling apart like crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.060" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">they&#39;re going to fall apart faster as</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.920" end="00:15:04.340" style="s2">the old legacy answers are shown to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:04.340" style="s2">in the middle of disruption</p>
