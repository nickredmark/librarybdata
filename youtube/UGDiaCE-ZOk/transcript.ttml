<p begin="00:00:03.870" end="00:00:07.429" style="s2">attacks on women&#39;s rights in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.460" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">country for the last few months and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.429" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">personally it&#39;s just something that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">cannot stand to watch on the sidelines</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:18.449" style="s2">anymore so I decided to make this video</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">to share with you some of the insights</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.449" end="00:00:23.580" style="s2">that I have into how this war on women</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">has come to be and what we can do about</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.580" end="00:00:29.369" style="s2">it so we really have to go back several</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">centuries to understand how this all</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.369" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">began back in the dark ages there was</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:37.050" style="s2">this period of time where dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">fundamentalist thinking was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.050" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">grounding for preserving a system of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">patriarchy and control and dominance by</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">men over women something that had been</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">happening for a very long time and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">began to lose its hold on society in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">enlightenment era in the 1600s and 1700s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:59.670" style="s2">when there was a growing trend of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">secularization that placed dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.670" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">views about the role of an authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:06.930" style="s2">God on society put that on the sideline</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">and started to elevate a different view</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.930" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">of human nature the places reasoning in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">the capacity for people to consider</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">happened in many ways it rose with the</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:35.579" style="s2">books that allowed people to seek their</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:02:00.149" style="s2">the world there began to have a</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">freedom that was based in a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:10.420" style="s2">people increasingly saw as being</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.160" end="00:02:21.010" style="s2">ended slavery and started to bring more</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.010" end="00:02:26.590" style="s2">races and cultures as we increased and</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.590" end="00:02:33.160" style="s2">in the societies that we lived in now</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.000" end="00:02:36.820" style="s2">this is something that&#39;s really become</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.160" end="00:02:41.230" style="s2">an acute conflict in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.820" end="00:02:44.590" style="s2">where the historic conservative</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.230" end="00:02:46.830" style="s2">patriarchal authoritarian view has</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.590" end="00:02:49.390" style="s2">corroded as there&#39;s been an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.830" end="00:02:52.270" style="s2">acceptance of the basic dignity and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.390" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">respect for all human beings and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.270" end="00:02:56.980" style="s2">inclusivity that enables us to consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:03:00.520" style="s2">how women should be empowered in society</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.980" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">of course this is something that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.520" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">today&#39;s world in politics we see express</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">through the label of conservatism in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:10.270" style="s2">United States now why is it that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">conservatism is so deeply maligned so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.270" end="00:03:16.690" style="s2">antithetical to women&#39;s rights in modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:17.830" style="s2">society we&#39;ll simply put conservatism is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.690" end="00:03:20.500" style="s2">a world of you that&#39;s based in</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.830" end="00:03:23.050" style="s2">authoritarianism the top-down hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.500" end="00:03:26.620" style="s2">and its central governing principle is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.050" end="00:03:29.140" style="s2">that the sanctity of authority must be</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.620" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">preserved at all costs now in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.140" end="00:03:33.970" style="s2">context of Western religion this is most</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:38.049" style="s2">pronounced and religious fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.970" end="00:03:39.850" style="s2">in Christianity in Judaism and even in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.049" end="00:03:42.010" style="s2">Islam where it&#39;s a fundamentalist view</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.850" end="00:03:44.410" style="s2">but always it&#39;s something that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.010" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">grounded and a notion that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.410" end="00:03:49.870" style="s2">vengeful God who is a male God who has</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">dominance over the world and women must</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.870" end="00:03:55.540" style="s2">know their place in the moral order and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:57.970" style="s2">so now the men of this movement to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.540" end="00:04:01.269" style="s2">protect to protect fundamentalism in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.970" end="00:04:03.459" style="s2">world are seeking to stamp out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.269" end="00:04:05.890" style="s2">rights of women to preserve that moral</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.459" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">order the moral order simply is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.890" end="00:04:09.910" style="s2">notion that there is a vertical</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:12.430" style="s2">hierarchy where God is above humans men</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.910" end="00:04:15.220" style="s2">are above women humanity&#39;s above nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.430" end="00:04:17.230" style="s2">and in some cases it&#39;s even still racist</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.220" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">that whites are above non-white</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.230" end="00:04:21.910" style="s2">and that Westerners are above mom</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:24.700" style="s2">Westerners but it&#39;s really most acute in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.910" end="00:04:26.770" style="s2">society today with the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.700" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">between men and women in their place in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.770" end="00:04:32.350" style="s2">society now something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:34.210" style="s2">fundamental to this psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.350" end="00:04:37.240" style="s2">that&#39;s happening right now is that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.210" end="00:04:40.050" style="s2">these patriarchal authoritarians you go</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.240" end="00:04:43.420" style="s2">by the name of conservative are actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.050" end="00:04:44.860" style="s2">acting like bullies in society they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.420" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">pushing their views around they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.860" end="00:04:50.650" style="s2">beating people up verbally emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:52.420" style="s2">and in some cases physically through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.650" end="00:04:55.870" style="s2">taking away of basic rights of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.420" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">and something that you may not know is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.870" end="00:05:03.700" style="s2">that the historic evolutionary roots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:05.800" style="s2">democracy in humanity actually come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.700" end="00:05:08.530" style="s2">that the way that groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.800" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">handle bullies so if you go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:12.940" style="s2">hunter-gatherer days where we lived in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">small bands of between 50 and 200 people</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.940" end="00:05:18.820" style="s2">group cohesion was absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:22.180" style="s2">for the survival of those groups and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.820" end="00:05:25.090" style="s2">the capacity for those groups to stop</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.180" end="00:05:27.160" style="s2">bullies from being the would-be upstarts</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.090" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">basically from stop them from becoming</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.160" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">dictators and siphoning valuable</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:34.030" style="s2">resources away from the group for their</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:36.070" style="s2">own gain became the central tenant of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.030" end="00:05:39.190" style="s2">what later emerged as the expression of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.070" end="00:05:43.000" style="s2">democracy so democracy at its very core</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.190" end="00:05:45.550" style="s2">is the power of the group to stop</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.000" end="00:05:47.200" style="s2">bullies from throwing their weight</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.550" end="00:05:50.230" style="s2">around and doing harm to the group at</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.200" end="00:05:52.600" style="s2">the expense of the group and so this war</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.230" end="00:05:55.930" style="s2">on women is really right at the core a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.600" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">battle for democracy so this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.930" end="00:06:00.280" style="s2">something that goes way back to our</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:03.910" style="s2">evolutionary origins to the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:07.420" style="s2">society itself is how do groups of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.910" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">people handle bullies when bullies are</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.420" end="00:06:11.910" style="s2">trying to throw their weight around and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:13.990" style="s2">do harm to the group for personal gain</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.910" end="00:06:16.330" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about the rights</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.990" end="00:06:18.100" style="s2">of women in this conversation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.330" end="00:06:20.860" style="s2">really talking about the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.100" end="00:06:24.430" style="s2">democracy if we cannot treat women while</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.860" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">in society then we can&#39;t treat anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">that has to do with democracy in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:32.530" style="s2">that&#39;s actually going to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">so what can we do about these bullies</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.530" end="00:06:37.900" style="s2">who have a patriarchal authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:40.389" style="s2">view of the world well first of all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.900" end="00:06:43.870" style="s2">way to stop a bully is to call them out</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.389" end="00:06:46.120" style="s2">to publicly shame them to say no more we</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.870" end="00:06:49.389" style="s2">will not accept this this is just as</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.120" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">true for the way that we handle say a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.389" end="00:06:55.270" style="s2">bully on the playground beating up</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">another kid or the way that homophobic</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.659" end="00:07:18.220" style="s2">against the patriarchal authoritarians</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.449" end="00:07:19.960" style="s2">these people who think that men should</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.220" end="00:07:22.169" style="s2">have demanded dominion over women and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.960" end="00:07:24.669" style="s2">that democracy has no place in society</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.669" end="00:07:29.380" style="s2">stopped we need to publicly shame them</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.889" end="00:07:33.690" style="s2">and say this is unacceptable in our</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.380" end="00:07:36.159" style="s2">world in America today also we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.690" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">call out that this is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.159" end="00:07:41.320" style="s2">outdated view of the world that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:43.690" style="s2">religious fundamentalism is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">that thrived in the dark ages but has no</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.690" end="00:07:48.159" style="s2">place in the modern era and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:51.099" style="s2">that it&#39;s raising its ugly head right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.159" end="00:07:53.889" style="s2">now is because it feels threatened this</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.099" end="00:07:56.650" style="s2">fundamentalism and it&#39;s patriarchy views</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.889" end="00:07:58.539" style="s2">or being challenged by increasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.650" end="00:08:01.719" style="s2">modernism and globalization and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.539" end="00:08:03.310" style="s2">expansion of human rights so this is our</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.719" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">time to call it out and say this is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.310" end="00:08:08.349" style="s2">21st century world we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:10.659" style="s2">basing how we treat people in society on</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.349" end="00:08:12.610" style="s2">the dictates of a moral code that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.659" end="00:08:15.370" style="s2">hundreds of years old and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.610" end="00:08:18.520" style="s2">even thousands of years old now is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.370" end="00:08:20.229" style="s2">time for us to focus on how to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.520" end="00:08:22.449" style="s2">deeply interconnected and pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.229" end="00:08:23.740" style="s2">world where we have to live with people</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.449" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">who have different views from ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.740" end="00:08:29.169" style="s2">we have to have tolerance and acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:32.140" style="s2">also we have to deal with global</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.169" end="00:08:34.510" style="s2">systemic threats so we have to live and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.140" end="00:08:37.000" style="s2">embrace live in and embrace the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.510" end="00:08:40.209" style="s2">complexities of the modern world so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.000" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">archaic notions of authoritarianism from</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.209" end="00:08:43.560" style="s2">a past</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">are not going to serve us today so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.560" end="00:08:47.459" style="s2">fundamentalism needs to be held in place</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.510" end="00:08:50.940" style="s2">and treated as the bullying that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.459" end="00:08:54.149" style="s2">truly is so what will happen if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.940" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">successful at doing this well simply put</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.149" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">we will be able to restore democracy to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:02.250" style="s2">its central place in American society</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:04.529" style="s2">and increasingly in the world which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.250" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">where it belongs so this is a time for</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.529" end="00:09:09.060" style="s2">us to call out the extremism in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:12.120" style="s2">political parties and of course this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.060" end="00:09:13.649" style="s2">an unbalanced equation the Republican</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.120" end="00:09:16.110" style="s2">Party has been taken over at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.649" end="00:09:18.060" style="s2">levels by these radical extremists</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">authoritarians and they are now</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.060" end="00:09:23.399" style="s2">espousing a fundamentalist view onto</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:25.560" style="s2">society which really has hints of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.399" end="00:09:28.200" style="s2">that we could even call in a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.560" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">technical way we could call them fascism</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.200" end="00:09:34.110" style="s2">how a dictator kind of mindset is being</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">used to oppress the masses to advance</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.110" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">its own view and consolidate power and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">this is happening in the alignment of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">religious fundamentalism with particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:44.519" style="s2">kinds of corporate governance and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:46.470" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that in the world today so</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.519" end="00:09:49.380" style="s2">this is our chance to put an end to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.470" end="00:09:52.020" style="s2">by rallying together around calling out</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.380" end="00:09:53.910" style="s2">how basic human rights for half of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.020" end="00:09:55.770" style="s2">species for all of the women in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.910" end="00:09:58.350" style="s2">world are being threatened in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.770" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">fundamental way and so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.350" end="00:10:02.339" style="s2">actually turn the tide on this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:04.140" style="s2">conversation change the discourse we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.339" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">elevate the discussion of what democracy</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.140" end="00:10:08.430" style="s2">is and should be how bullies should be</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:10.649" style="s2">treated in society and what we as if</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.430" end="00:10:14.490" style="s2">people want to do in our 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.649" end="00:10:16.680" style="s2">world and of course now is the time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.490" end="00:10:19.110" style="s2">take action we saw earlier this year</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.680" end="00:10:21.510" style="s2">what happened when Rush Limbaugh started</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.110" end="00:10:23.130" style="s2">bullying and upstanding young woman he</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.510" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">called her a slut he called her a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.130" end="00:10:28.170" style="s2">prostitute he even went so far as to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">suggest that if she wants to have sex</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.170" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">and have contraception covered by</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:35.550" style="s2">medical insurance that she should film</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:37.800" style="s2">it and he and other patriarchal men can</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.550" end="00:10:41.459" style="s2">watch her sexual encounters as</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.800" end="00:10:43.410" style="s2">pornography talk about disgusting and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.459" end="00:10:45.690" style="s2">the amazing thing is the response that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.410" end="00:10:48.510" style="s2">came from that as women around the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.690" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">use social media to rally themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.510" end="00:10:51.690" style="s2">to bring the men who cared about them</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:54.060" style="s2">and you agreed with them too</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.690" end="00:10:56.220" style="s2">cause it was real women leadership</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.060" end="00:10:58.440" style="s2">female leadership that caused this to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.220" end="00:11:00.540" style="s2">happen and they initiated a boycott</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.440" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">against Rush Limbaugh and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.540" end="00:11:03.420" style="s2">if you know this but for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:05.250" style="s2">in the history of Rush Limbaugh Show</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.420" end="00:11:07.650" style="s2">there was actually a blackout during</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.250" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">advertising a 30-second window of time</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.650" end="00:11:11.400" style="s2">where there was silence because they</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">weren&#39;t able to get enough advertisers</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.400" end="00:11:15.900" style="s2">to pay for commercials that shows that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:18.030" style="s2">they are weak that they&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.900" end="00:11:21.180" style="s2">defensive and so now is the time to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.030" end="00:11:23.220" style="s2">after them and to beat them back down we</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.180" end="00:11:26.460" style="s2">collectively need to put a stop to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.220" end="00:11:28.350" style="s2">kind of bullying and if we do we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.460" end="00:11:30.290" style="s2">return the focus of this country in its</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.350" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">national discourse to where it belongs</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.290" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">which is focusing on how to build and</p>
