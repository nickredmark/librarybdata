<p begin="00:00:05.350" end="00:00:10.960" style="s2">welcome to the latest rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.370" end="00:00:12.170" style="s2">podcast this is a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.960" end="00:00:15.470" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.170" end="00:00:19.160" style="s2">so last week I interviewed Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.470" end="00:00:20.570" style="s2">Peterson again for the second time and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.160" end="00:00:23.840" style="s2">asked him a few questions about</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.570" end="00:00:24.890" style="s2">relationship with the left and he gave a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:26.660" style="s2">few answers that I&#39;d never heard before</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.890" end="00:00:32.930" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna play some of that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.660" end="00:00:34.489" style="s2">this podcast and off the back of that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.930" end="00:00:35.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve also just come back from America</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.489" end="00:00:38.059" style="s2">and we&#39;d recorded this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.920" end="00:00:39.860" style="s2">discussion with some guys from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.059" end="00:00:42.649" style="s2">California Institute of integral studies</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.860" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">on exactly the same topic what can the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.649" end="00:00:47.690" style="s2">left learn from Jordan Peterson so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:49.250" style="s2">decided to bring out a whole do a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.690" end="00:00:51.950" style="s2">more interviews on the same subject and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.250" end="00:00:54.710" style="s2">bring out about six or seven interviews</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.950" end="00:00:56.809" style="s2">at the same time so if you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.710" end="00:00:59.090" style="s2">this the link to all of those interviews</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.809" end="00:01:00.590" style="s2">should be below this in the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.090" end="00:01:03.879" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna play some clips from</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.590" end="00:01:07.009" style="s2">those during this during this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.879" end="00:01:09.130" style="s2">because it feels to me like we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.009" end="00:01:11.240" style="s2">with rebel wisdom to really follow the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.130" end="00:01:12.950" style="s2">cultural conversation really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.240" end="00:01:16.249" style="s2">identify where the cultural conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.950" end="00:01:18.859" style="s2">is going and it seems to me that for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.249" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">quite a while on the left in particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.859" end="00:01:21.229" style="s2">they were kind of waiting for Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:23.109" style="s2">Peterson to go away</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.229" end="00:01:26.599" style="s2">like anyone who has that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.109" end="00:01:30.349" style="s2">exponential curve usually explodes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.599" end="00:01:31.609" style="s2">goes away he doesn&#39;t seem to be I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.349" end="00:01:35.090" style="s2">actually asked him that question at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.609" end="00:01:37.039" style="s2">beginning of the interview and his</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.090" end="00:01:39.169" style="s2">theory is that this is actually a switch</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.039" end="00:01:40.849" style="s2">over from different forms of media from</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.169" end="00:01:42.979" style="s2">broadcast media where they get tired of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.849" end="00:01:45.829" style="s2">you and they spit you out to online</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.979" end="00:01:48.529" style="s2">media where that narrative no longer</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.829" end="00:01:50.959" style="s2">holds which is interesting in itself and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.529" end="00:01:53.749" style="s2">we&#39;ll put up that sometime soon I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.959" end="00:01:55.849" style="s2">want to get dragged into politics too</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.749" end="00:01:59.539" style="s2">much we&#39;ve basically done lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.849" end="00:02:04.009" style="s2">so far about different subjects</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.539" end="00:02:06.469" style="s2">spirituality psychedelics our sense is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.009" end="00:02:09.219" style="s2">that by the idea of rebel wisdom is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.469" end="00:02:11.540" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing is a is a change in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.219" end="00:02:13.219" style="s2">paradigms a change in world views and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.540" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of trying to kind of identify</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.219" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">what that is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">politics is just a subset of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">of wider shift that we&#39;re seeing going</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">on and I think for me it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:24.660" style="s2">important we don&#39;t get dragged down into</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">the political level too much but I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">this is what&#39;s been coming up so far so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">we&#39;re doing one big foray into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">political space as you&#39;re saying that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:37.019" style="s2">reminded me of something actually either</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">Jesse or Matt said from CIA s the CIA s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.019" end="00:02:42.209" style="s2">talk which will be released same time as</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:44.580" style="s2">this which was around it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.209" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">interesting to talk about the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.580" end="00:02:49.709" style="s2">symptoms so the underlying structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:51.390" style="s2">than the symptoms and politics for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.709" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">feels very much like a symptom of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.390" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">underlying issue it&#39;s for me in many</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">ways the least interesting thing to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">about not least because we know or have</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">pretty good evidence to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">your own temperament you know how you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">balance the big five personality traits</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">etc has a huge influence in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">politics as as your personal history so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">so in a sense while it is important and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:15.540" style="s2">interesting I think it&#39;s it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:17.099" style="s2">it&#39;s the tip of the iceberg and and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.540" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">personally am also much more interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.099" end="00:03:21.900" style="s2">in the the rest of the iceberg</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.329" style="s2">another thing as well which is worth</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:26.100" style="s2">mentioning is that I think we both</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.329" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">started talking maybe just quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.100" end="00:03:28.980" style="s2">recently a couple weeks ago about is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">there a shift happening within the left</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.980" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">now there&#39;s a couple of things came out</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">at the same time there was paper from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">pretty well-known activist here not sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">if you remember of each novel house I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">think that&#39;s it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.700" style="s2">mentioning how he&#39;d been putting on</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:46.889" style="s2">conferences and and they had been taken</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">over by the kind of what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.889" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">this the social justice kind of identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2">politics fundamentalism and it had you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">know this is someone who genuinely cares</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.450" end="00:03:57.329" style="s2">about making systems change and he had</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:03:59.069" style="s2">started noticing what we&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.329" end="00:03:59.670" style="s2">anywhere it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.069" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">taken over</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.670" end="00:04:04.829" style="s2">that was interesting and then Obama</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">criticized the shortcomings of identity</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:09.780" style="s2">politics ABC put it out and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">tweet that something about it&#39;s not who</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.780" end="00:04:14.100" style="s2">you are that should decide whether you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">get to speak yet precisely yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.100" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">he used a really nice example of when</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">Nelson Mandela was in prison and what he</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t do was kind of polarize into one</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:26.129" style="s2">thing and get sucked into hate yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:28.830" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also worth mentioning the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.129" end="00:04:31.710" style="s2">all of these words are kind of labels</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.830" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">like we we talk a lot about integral</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.710" end="00:04:36.029" style="s2">theory for example the idea that even</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:37.469" style="s2">left and we&#39;re sort of in a position now</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.029" end="00:04:40.229" style="s2">where we&#39;re kind of going beyond left or</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.469" end="00:04:43.740" style="s2">right and I think that&#39;s very true and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.229" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to to say that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.740" end="00:04:46.349" style="s2">can talk about the word left you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:48.029" style="s2">talk about the word liberal you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.349" end="00:04:49.590" style="s2">about the word progressive they tend</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.029" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">there are personality types that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.590" end="00:04:53.550" style="s2">underpin the sort of the idea of left</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:56.610" style="s2">and right sort of more one more open</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.550" end="00:04:58.349" style="s2">than closed one more ordered than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.610" end="00:05:00.539" style="s2">other I mean these these are do exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.349" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">but there&#39;s always a sort of fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.539" end="00:05:06.060" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about this so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:07.409" style="s2">not that I think especially if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.060" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">been in this sort of space for a while</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.409" end="00:05:11.370" style="s2">you kind of maybe even flinch at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">idea of people using the words left and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.370" end="00:05:14.069" style="s2">right because you&#39;re kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:15.900" style="s2">whipped we&#39;re so beyond all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.069" end="00:05:17.129" style="s2">labels and it&#39;s like well we are but</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:20.009" style="s2">they are actually pointing to real</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.129" end="00:05:22.199" style="s2">temperamental differences and there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.009" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">habits of thought on what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.199" end="00:05:29.939" style="s2">the Left which are yeah which are are</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.580" end="00:05:31.229" style="s2">shared by most people who would who</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.939" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">would share those kind of personality</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.229" end="00:05:36.419" style="s2">characteristics and share those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:39.150" style="s2">that kind of worldview so we can use the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.419" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">word meaningfully I think while holding</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.150" end="00:05:42.719" style="s2">it quite lightly at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:44.759" style="s2">without further ado we&#39;re going to play</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.719" end="00:05:47.129" style="s2">the first clip of the interview Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.759" end="00:05:48.930" style="s2">Peterson Eric Weinstein describe sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.129" end="00:05:52.860" style="s2">the cultural moment as a kind of civil</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.930" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">war within the left i I&#39;m I&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.860" end="00:05:56.819" style="s2">of progressive friends and what I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">happening recently maybe in the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.819" end="00:06:02.939" style="s2">couple of weeks is a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">starting to grapple with your ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.939" end="00:06:07.969" style="s2">looking at lasting this question what</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.649" style="s2">can the left learn from Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.969" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">which is which is a pretty new</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.649" end="00:06:15.050" style="s2">development because I saw a lot of kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:18.449" style="s2">of reactivity to it before</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.050" end="00:06:24.449" style="s2">how can you personally contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.449" end="00:06:25.139" style="s2">that debate and absolutely no no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.449" end="00:06:28.889" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.139" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">no doubt about it what one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.889" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing in my tour repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:35.639" style="s2">when I talk about the first chapter of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:37.289" style="s2">my book which is stand up straight with</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.639" end="00:06:38.289" style="s2">your shoulders back it&#39;s a discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.289" end="00:06:40.389" style="s2">hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.289" end="00:06:42.399" style="s2">their eternal nature right because my</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.389" end="00:06:47.110" style="s2">claim is is not my claim I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.399" end="00:06:49.960" style="s2">mere fact that organisms that have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.110" end="00:06:53.289" style="s2">cooperate and compete with other</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.960" end="00:06:55.330" style="s2">organisms of their type inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.289" end="00:06:58.330" style="s2">arrange themselves into hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.330" end="00:07:00.969" style="s2">that&#39;s been going on for so long which</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.330" end="00:07:03.069" style="s2">is at least 300 million years that our</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.969" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">nervous systems have adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.069" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">hierarchies as if they&#39;re a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:12.759" style="s2">element of being right more permanent</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:15.129" style="s2">than trees like seriously permanent at</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.759" end="00:07:16.839" style="s2">the most fundamental neurochemical the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.129" end="00:07:19.629" style="s2">one that regulates the entire brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.839" end="00:07:21.909" style="s2">serotonin is acutely sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.629" end="00:07:24.369" style="s2">hierarchical distinctions and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.909" end="00:07:27.839" style="s2">part of the proposition I laid that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.369" end="00:07:31.240" style="s2">proposition forward was to say whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.839" end="00:07:34.169" style="s2">pitfalls hierarchies might produce you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.240" end="00:07:36.550" style="s2">cannot lay them at the feet of the West</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.169" end="00:07:39.009" style="s2">patriarchy or capitalism it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.550" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a non-starter you&#39;re wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.009" end="00:07:43.539" style="s2">not just a little bit wrong you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.789" style="s2">seriously wrong that if you insist upon</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.539" end="00:07:47.979" style="s2">doing that you won&#39;t even achieve your</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.789" end="00:07:49.779" style="s2">own aims because you&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.979" end="00:07:52.599" style="s2">grappling with the problem the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.779" end="00:07:55.539" style="s2">is if hierarchies are a problem which</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.599" end="00:07:59.559" style="s2">they are the problem is way more serious</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.539" end="00:08:01.149" style="s2">than mere capitalism it&#39;s way deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.559" end="00:08:04.779" style="s2">if you&#39;re actually interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.149" end="00:08:06.370" style="s2">rectifying the constantly the negative</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.779" end="00:08:07.209" style="s2">consequences of hierarchies then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.370" end="00:08:09.939" style="s2">gonna have to get a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.209" end="00:08:14.199" style="s2">sophisticated than there then your idiot</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.939" end="00:08:16.869" style="s2">Marxism so so so part of the elaboration</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.199" end="00:08:19.149" style="s2">of that argument is well hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.869" end="00:08:20.769" style="s2">inevitable because we have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.149" end="00:08:22.959" style="s2">complex problems and we have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.769" end="00:08:25.240" style="s2">them socially and when you implement a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.959" end="00:08:27.189" style="s2">solution to a complex problem socially</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.240" end="00:08:28.389" style="s2">you produce a hierarchy because some</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.189" end="00:08:30.490" style="s2">people are better at the implementation</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.389" end="00:08:32.589" style="s2">than others so there&#39;s a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.490" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">competence and then there&#39;s a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.589" end="00:08:38.099" style="s2">of distribution of the Spoils and so and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:40.839" style="s2">in both of those hierarchies you get a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.099" end="00:08:42.669" style="s2">disproportionate clumping of resources</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.839" end="00:08:44.769" style="s2">at the top and dispossession at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.669" end="00:08:48.639" style="s2">bottom it&#39;s in the nature of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.769" end="00:08:51.730" style="s2">so what&#39;s the left for the left is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.639" end="00:08:54.699" style="s2">remind those who are benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.730" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">hierarchies that the hierarchy comes at</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.699" end="00:09:01.089" style="s2">a cost and the cost is the clumping of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:04.899" style="s2">people at the bottom and that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.089" end="00:09:06.610" style="s2">eternal cost and it&#39;s not trivial and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.899" end="00:09:08.529" style="s2">that&#39;s what the left should be properly</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.610" end="00:09:11.199" style="s2">focused on the Left should be providing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.529" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">the voice of those who are dispossessed</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.199" end="00:09:17.500" style="s2">by hierarchies and the right should be</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:19.779" style="s2">saying yeah but the damn hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.500" end="00:09:23.380" style="s2">necessary and they&#39;re not only necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.779" end="00:09:25.889" style="s2">but they&#39;re also productive then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.380" end="00:09:28.570" style="s2">left says yes but they tilt towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.889" end="00:09:30.459" style="s2">tyranny and they can be occupied</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.570" end="00:09:33.490" style="s2">inappropriately by people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.459" end="00:09:35.230" style="s2">playing games of power fair enough the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.490" end="00:09:38.050" style="s2">right has to take that into account the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.230" end="00:09:40.089" style="s2">hierarchy can rigidity rigidify and is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.050" end="00:09:41.709" style="s2">likely to do that and it can be taken</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.089" end="00:09:45.190" style="s2">over by people who are corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.709" end="00:09:47.019" style="s2">that&#39;s likely to happen and so but but</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.190" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">it&#39;s okay because the dialogue can work</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.019" end="00:09:50.740" style="s2">out the the right can say well yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:52.510" style="s2">need the damn hierarchies and they need</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.740" end="00:09:56.199" style="s2">to be but wrists and the left can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.510" end="00:09:58.569" style="s2">yes but they have to be maintained</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.199" end="00:10:00.699" style="s2">properly so they don&#39;t deteriorate and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.569" end="00:10:02.620" style="s2">degenerate and and I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.699" end="00:10:04.209" style="s2">think that&#39;s ancient wisdom I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.620" end="00:10:07.750" style="s2">ancient Egyptians had figured that out</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.209" end="00:10:10.329" style="s2">in their symbolic representations so now</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.750" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">when the left goes too far</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.329" end="00:10:14.380" style="s2">it does something like say well how</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">about no hierarchies it&#39;s like no how</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.380" end="00:10:20.230" style="s2">about not wrong because all that happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:21.550" style="s2">if you flatten one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">happens if you flatten out the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.550" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t even organize your</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:28.329" style="s2">perceptions you can&#39;t perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:31.209" style="s2">without looking at the world through a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.329" end="00:10:32.860" style="s2">hierarchy of value and if because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.209" end="00:10:34.690" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive the world unless you make</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.860" end="00:10:35.889" style="s2">one thing more important than all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.690" end="00:10:38.170" style="s2">other things because you don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.889" end="00:10:39.550" style="s2">what to look at and if one thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.170" end="00:10:41.230" style="s2">more important than all the other things</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.550" end="00:10:42.459" style="s2">then you have nothing to aim at if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.230" end="00:10:44.680" style="s2">have nothing to aim at then you have no</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.459" end="00:10:46.690" style="s2">meaning in your life so the left can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.680" end="00:10:49.269" style="s2">just demolish the hierarchies in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.690" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">name of some equality of outcome let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.269" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">say because you blow out the future you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:10:56.110" style="s2">leave people aimless and you destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:57.699" style="s2">very institutions that allow people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.110" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">make competent progress in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.699" end="00:11:04.810" style="s2">that&#39;s not an acceptable outcome so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:06.389" style="s2">have to we have to agree to live with</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.810" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">the ten</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.389" end="00:11:12.310" style="s2">necessity for hierarchies the proclivity</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:14.259" style="s2">for them to pathologize and the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.310" end="00:11:17.800" style="s2">necessary voice of the left and speaking</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.259" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">for thee for the dispossessed so and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.800" end="00:11:22.120" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve as far as I&#39;m concerned I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:25.389" style="s2">said something approximating that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.120" end="00:11:26.649" style="s2">through my entire career and so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.389" end="00:11:30.149" style="s2">that the left wingers have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.649" end="00:11:33.100" style="s2">irritated at me is well in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.149" end="00:11:35.199" style="s2">that&#39;s an inevitable consequence of me</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.100" end="00:11:40.089" style="s2">taking on the radical left wingers but</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.199" end="00:11:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s also the refusal by the moderate</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.089" end="00:11:44.620" style="s2">left to deal with their internal</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.310" end="00:11:46.180" style="s2">problems yeah so the first question I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.620" end="00:11:47.709" style="s2">asked was whether he actually wants to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.180" end="00:11:49.990" style="s2">be part of that conversation like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.709" end="00:11:51.970" style="s2">conversation with the internal</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.990" end="00:11:53.829" style="s2">conversation which as Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.970" end="00:11:56.050" style="s2">said it feels like what&#39;s going on is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.829" end="00:11:57.610" style="s2">civil war within the left and it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.050" end="00:11:59.170" style="s2">of the mainstream left that&#39;s now become</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.610" end="00:12:01.240" style="s2">a cult that was the counterculture has</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.170" end="00:12:03.399" style="s2">now become the mainstream culture how</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.240" end="00:12:05.259" style="s2">does the Left draw boundaries because</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.399" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2">the left by by its nature does not like</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.259" end="00:12:11.350" style="s2">boundaries so the issue is how does the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.170" end="00:12:13.540" style="s2">Left draw boundaries around internal</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.350" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">boundaries that say well actually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.540" end="00:12:17.260" style="s2">trying to hijack the conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:18.819" style="s2">have an ideological agenda or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.260" end="00:12:20.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like how can you have a generative</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.819" end="00:12:22.120" style="s2">dialogue when you can&#39;t build boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.980" end="00:12:24.760" style="s2">of people who are not willing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.120" end="00:12:26.319" style="s2">acknowledge the the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.760" end="00:12:28.810" style="s2">required to have a generative dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.319" end="00:12:29.980" style="s2">that for me is the sort of the best way</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.810" end="00:12:34.120" style="s2">of describing what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.980" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">left and I have got the sense with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.120" end="00:12:38.199" style="s2">Jordan Peterson part of this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">optics he&#39;s been on Fox News a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.199" end="00:12:46.120" style="s2">he he was also on I think rebel media</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.860" end="00:12:48.310" style="s2">very different formal wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.120" end="00:12:52.569" style="s2">sense that he because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.310" end="00:12:54.279" style="s2">polarizing and volatile moment has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.569" end="00:12:56.709" style="s2">pulled on to one side of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.279" end="00:12:58.510" style="s2">wars but the right has embraced him the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.709" end="00:13:00.459" style="s2">left has kind of rejected him so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.510" end="00:13:01.050" style="s2">by definition he&#39;s seen on one side more</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.459" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">than the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.050" end="00:13:05.980" style="s2">personally I don&#39;t actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">he I don&#39;t think he&#39;s natural home is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.980" end="00:13:10.329" style="s2">that and I think if people sort of were</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.529" end="00:13:11.949" style="s2">able to get past some of their</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.329" end="00:13:14.980" style="s2">reactivity to him they&#39;d see that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.949" end="00:13:16.630" style="s2">not his natural home yeah yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.980" end="00:13:17.670" style="s2">with that I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.630" end="00:13:19.500" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.670" end="00:13:21.510" style="s2">as you were saying that I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.500" end="00:13:23.340" style="s2">like could he have been picked up by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.510" end="00:13:25.410" style="s2">more left-leaning ones and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.340" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">because of that ideological blindness in</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.410" end="00:13:29.910" style="s2">the culture within many parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:32.610" style="s2">left I think would have been so</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.910" end="00:13:35.220" style="s2">difficult for him for them to they</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.610" end="00:13:36.900" style="s2">couldn&#39;t they can&#39;t hold that complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.220" end="00:13:41.030" style="s2">I think a few people have written</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.900" end="00:13:43.770" style="s2">articles recently about how the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.030" end="00:13:45.540" style="s2">was able to draw boundaries because of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.770" end="00:13:47.460" style="s2">the horrors of World War two and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.540" end="00:13:51.450" style="s2">horrors of seeing really what happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.460" end="00:13:54.060" style="s2">when fascism you know it gets gets the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.450" end="00:13:55.620" style="s2">interposition of power and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.060" end="00:13:57.540" style="s2">weird thing on the left you see it with</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.620" end="00:14:00.140" style="s2">Corbin you see it with a lot of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.540" end="00:14:02.670" style="s2">of old-school left and and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.140" end="00:14:04.620" style="s2">the young woman who was on Piers Morgan</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.670" end="00:14:07.980" style="s2">and said I&#39;m literally a communist you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.620" end="00:14:12.270" style="s2">know ash Sarkar I think that was just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:13.590" style="s2">few days ago and Douglas Murray wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.270" end="00:14:16.200" style="s2">really good piece actually in spectator</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.590" end="00:14:17.850" style="s2">around the insanity of that of like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.200" end="00:14:19.890" style="s2">right knows how bad it gets when the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.850" end="00:14:23.850" style="s2">right goes extreme the left should know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.890" end="00:14:25.980" style="s2">like and I mean it&#39;s clear it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:28.740" style="s2">history but we know was a even more</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.980" end="00:14:30.150" style="s2">recent and happen over and over again in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.740" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">many different countries and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.150" end="00:14:34.530" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s that element at play as</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.030" style="s2">well and Jordan P doesn&#39;t talks about</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.530" end="00:14:38.220" style="s2">that a lot you know he talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.030" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">the horrors of collective and how the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.220" end="00:14:44.250" style="s2">left how the sort of pathology on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:45.660" style="s2">left is not necessarily one single idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.250" end="00:14:47.280" style="s2">like on the right it&#39;s kind of racial</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.660" end="00:14:49.170" style="s2">superiority or right you&#39;re no longer in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.280" end="00:14:51.480" style="s2">the conversation on the left it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.170" end="00:14:53.970" style="s2">of it it&#39;s a combination maybe three</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.480" end="00:14:56.400" style="s2">good values but I think the central one</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.970" end="00:14:58.080" style="s2">is that fairness is a good value but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.400" end="00:15:01.140" style="s2">you make fairness you&#39;re kind of primary</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.080" end="00:15:04.380" style="s2">axiom it ends up leading to madness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.140" end="00:15:08.550" style="s2">that&#39;s another Eric Weinstein quote he</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.380" end="00:15:10.350" style="s2">says that if you build a cosmology on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.550" end="00:15:13.290" style="s2">narrative of oppression it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.350" end="00:15:16.650" style="s2">madness because as jordan peterson said</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.290" end="00:15:18.270" style="s2">in the interview with me if depending on</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.650" end="00:15:20.340" style="s2">where you draw the line everyone is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.270" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">oppressor and everyone is approached on</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.340" end="00:15:25.650" style="s2">some level the the interesting thing as</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.400" style="s2">well for me about the left of this sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.650" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">of talk about the mask of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.400" end="00:15:32.080" style="s2">but just this assumption of moral good</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:34.750" style="s2">on the left and I think Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.080" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">been the victim of that this assumption</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.750" end="00:15:39.280" style="s2">that all all the moral value is on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2">left and on people who think in the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.280" end="00:15:45.250" style="s2">way as people on the left think and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:46.960" style="s2">struck by though there was one piece in</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.250" end="00:15:50.380" style="s2">one of his podcasts sorry one of his</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.960" end="00:15:53.170" style="s2">lectures where he describes helping one</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.380" end="00:15:57.280" style="s2">of his patients as a psychologist with</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.170" end="00:15:59.080" style="s2">he he got him a job in a charity folding</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.280" end="00:16:00.850" style="s2">letters in fact the guy found it really</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.080" end="00:16:02.530" style="s2">really difficult like it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.850" end="00:16:03.700" style="s2">to do but the narrative that comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.530" end="00:16:06.640" style="s2">through is that he was with this guy for</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.700" end="00:16:10.150" style="s2">like 10 hours and supported him for many</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.640" end="00:16:13.330" style="s2">years and it&#39;s that&#39;s what I find really</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.150" end="00:16:14.680" style="s2">difficult when people it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.330" end="00:16:16.150" style="s2">this is someone who cares deeply about</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.680" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">people has been deeply involved in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.150" end="00:16:19.960" style="s2">people&#39;s lives helping people so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.220" end="00:16:21.610" style="s2">assumption of the left of well he must</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.960" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">be a monster or he must be a fraud all</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.610" end="00:16:25.720" style="s2">of this stuff is really it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">to take for anyone who&#39;s kind of delved</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.720" end="00:16:30.460" style="s2">into his lectures understands the kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.880" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">of guy that is yeah not surprising for</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.460" end="00:16:35.050" style="s2">me having not really been on the left</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:38.050" style="s2">since I was maybe 18 and having been</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.050" end="00:16:40.120" style="s2">more on the kind of yeah certainly more</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.050" end="00:16:41.590" style="s2">towards the right maybe more an artistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.120" end="00:16:45.490" style="s2">and libertarian at different times but</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.590" end="00:16:46.900" style="s2">there is an assumption generally exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.490" end="00:16:50.860" style="s2">what you said that all the moral virtues</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.900" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">on the left which is not true when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.860" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">actually engage with with thought that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.220" style="s2">comes from the right especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:16:59.650" style="s2">think about so France Duvall Dutch</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.220" end="00:17:02.520" style="s2">biologist has done many experiments</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.650" end="00:17:06.730" style="s2">around empathy and animals in in mammals</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.520" end="00:17:08.320" style="s2">and pretty conclusively shown that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.730" end="00:17:10.270" style="s2">fairness is something that&#39;s built into</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.320" end="00:17:12.940" style="s2">us we all have a sense of what&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.270" end="00:17:15.070" style="s2">it&#39;s so deeply built in that if you get</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.070" end="00:17:18.089" style="s2">of them a treat and not the other one</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.660" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">the other dog will stop doing that trick</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.089" end="00:17:24.070" style="s2">and capuchin monkeys men I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.780" style="s2">deeply ingrained so to assume that one</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.070" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">side of the political spectrum somehow</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.780" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">has it and the other side don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:32.500" style="s2">this biologically encoded sense of it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:34.060" style="s2">absurd because everyone cares about</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.060" end="00:17:37.240" style="s2">spectrum it&#39;s just that they have a</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.240" end="00:17:40.780" style="s2">and what isn&#39;t and this is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.400" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">time to play a clip for</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.590" end="00:18:27.370" style="s2">refreshing it&#39;s really stimulating my</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.030" end="00:18:29.710" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s hard to see other people</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.370" end="00:18:31.750" style="s2">not join me in that and get kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.710" end="00:18:34.600" style="s2">weirded out or freaked out by it which</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.750" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">then makes me even more intrigued so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.600" end="00:18:38.830" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a clip from one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">pieces that we&#39;ve just put live so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.830" end="00:18:44.170" style="s2">a four-way debate that we had with Jesse</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:45.730" style="s2">Esther no Matthew Siegel after they so</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.170" end="00:18:47.920" style="s2">they come from a very sort of liberal</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.730" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">left-leaning college called the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.920" end="00:18:51.460" style="s2">California Institute of integral studies</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:53.050" style="s2">but were really and Gately put out this</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.460" end="00:18:54.250" style="s2">podcast where they started asking what</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.050" end="00:18:56.470" style="s2">the left could learn from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.250" end="00:18:59.020" style="s2">Peterson and what the reactivity on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.470" end="00:19:01.450" style="s2">left to him said and I love the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.020" end="00:19:05.020" style="s2">things that we explore in there is why</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.450" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">the quality of the rejection by the left</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.020" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">is so extreme that there must be</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:12.730" style="s2">something else going on what Jesse says</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:16.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like a psychological complex almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.730" end="00:19:18.010" style="s2">it&#39;s - it&#39;s it&#39;s out of kilter with with</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.420" end="00:19:20.050" style="s2">what&#39;s actually going on and whenever</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.010" end="00:19:21.790" style="s2">something like that happened you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.050" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">kind of unpack it and try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.790" end="00:19:26.800" style="s2">why people are having such reactivity or</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:28.540" style="s2">such kind of strong responses to it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.800" end="00:19:30.100" style="s2">I thought that was a really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.540" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">every moment of that conversation really</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.100" end="00:19:35.950" style="s2">smart embodied guys it goes that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">really good flow to the the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.950" end="00:19:42.460" style="s2">exploring the ideas with a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:44.950" style="s2">respect and yeah watch it it&#39;s good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.460" end="00:19:46.420" style="s2">so one of the things that we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.950" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">and we thought okay so there is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.420" end="00:19:50.560" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely something happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.300" style="s2">where people on the Left are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.560" end="00:19:54.140" style="s2">ask what Jordan Peterson has to offer</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.300" end="00:19:56.810" style="s2">and one of those was at</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.140" end="00:19:59.960" style="s2">Ronin Harrington put out this film for</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.810" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">his channel alter-ego saying comparing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.960" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">and contrasting Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:07.010" style="s2">Russell Brand and in his sort of circles</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:08.210" style="s2">even kind of validating Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.010" end="00:20:11.150" style="s2">in st. well he might have something to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.210" end="00:20:13.220" style="s2">offer provoked some kind of reaction in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:17.630" style="s2">some of the people that watch the video</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.220" end="00:20:19.070" style="s2">but and we had a really great chat where</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.630" end="00:20:21.590" style="s2">he agrees with Jordan Peterson where he</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.070" end="00:20:24.020" style="s2">disagrees but I think his his central</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.590" end="00:20:26.030" style="s2">point about the criticism was really</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.020" end="00:20:28.550" style="s2">really good in a way the video was about</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.030" end="00:20:31.040" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s thinking but on a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.550" end="00:20:34.150" style="s2">meta level it was a commentary on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.040" end="00:20:36.680" style="s2">political culture so we face this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.150" end="00:20:39.350" style="s2">enormous pressure to either love or hate</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.680" end="00:20:40.730" style="s2">either public figures or issues or to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.350" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">endorse them and to reject them and to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.730" end="00:20:45.980" style="s2">be very public in that but people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:47.750" style="s2">issues are really complex and with</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.980" end="00:20:50.540" style="s2">someone like Jordan Peterson I can see</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.750" end="00:20:52.490" style="s2">lots of as I said in the video profound</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.540" end="00:20:54.560" style="s2">contributions and strengths and also</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.490" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">areas for I feel like his thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.560" end="00:21:00.170" style="s2">really off and how can you hold that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:01.790" style="s2">complexity in a tribal polarized culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.170" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">where you&#39;re kind of shut down for</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.790" end="00:21:06.050" style="s2">holding it and I think that that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">is the new political space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.050" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">opening up as more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:12.740" style="s2">willing to go like no I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:15.560" style="s2">just fall into a binary I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.740" end="00:21:18.050" style="s2">and stay open and hold the complexity so</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.560" end="00:21:20.750" style="s2">I think his point that a lot of jordan</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.050" end="00:21:21.950" style="s2">peterson admirers like i really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.750" end="00:21:24.860" style="s2">like the word fan cuz i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.950" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">terrible energy but a lot of jordan</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.860" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">Peterson admirers are really put off by</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:35.030" style="s2">the tone of the criticism of him it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:36.950" style="s2">not that we don&#39;t like people</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.030" end="00:21:39.470" style="s2">Krita criticizing Jordan Peters and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.950" end="00:21:40.760" style="s2">Jordans ideas even he himself welcomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.470" end="00:21:43.250" style="s2">and invites people to criticize his</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.760" end="00:21:44.630" style="s2">ideas but it&#39;s the tone that comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.250" end="00:21:47.210" style="s2">through a lot of the time in the media</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.630" end="00:21:49.580" style="s2">articles when you hear someone say he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.210" end="00:21:51.770" style="s2">a fraud or he&#39;s a charlatan or any of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.580" end="00:21:53.000" style="s2">this stuff it&#39;s like he&#39;s clearly not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.770" end="00:21:54.740" style="s2">fraud or a charlatan</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.000" end="00:21:56.330" style="s2">so as soon as you start using that kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.740" end="00:21:57.410" style="s2">of language in a criticism it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.330" end="00:22:02.030" style="s2">difficult to take that criticism</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.410" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">seriously and also it&#39;s very there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.030" end="00:22:08.300" style="s2">there&#39;s such a an arrogance in some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">the critiques that is like I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.300" end="00:22:12.950" style="s2">one in particular is like okay you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:15.920" style="s2">you&#39;re a you&#39;re a journalist in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.950" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">late 20s you&#39;ve done what exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.920" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">gives you that the the knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:24.470" style="s2">self-knowledge to be able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:26.570" style="s2">pass judgment on someone who is is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.470" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">having whether you like him or not this</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.570" end="00:22:31.040" style="s2">incredible impact on on people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:32.300" style="s2">all around the world but what what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.040" end="00:22:34.850" style="s2">going on what is going on at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.300" end="00:22:36.650" style="s2">subconscious level mmm-hmm it reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.850" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">of I mean there&#39;s a couple of answers</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.650" end="00:22:43.460" style="s2">that I&#39;ve heard from a few people which</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.100" style="s2">is that it&#39;s like okay that they post an</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.460" end="00:22:47.420" style="s2">article it&#39;s like that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.100" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">mischaracterizing his ideas here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.420" end="00:22:51.140" style="s2">lectures where he talks about them and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:53.480" style="s2">the response is often well I kinda have</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.140" end="00:22:55.790" style="s2">time to watch 20 hours of lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.480" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">my response if if the journalist says</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.790" end="00:23:01.340" style="s2">that is like well then don&#39;t write about</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:04.370" style="s2">him you know it&#39;s I think that&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.340" end="00:23:06.100" style="s2">just thinking as well of the unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.370" end="00:23:08.750" style="s2">but slightly related the James d&#39;amore</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.100" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">memo that he got fired from Google for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.750" end="00:23:12.560" style="s2">that was a similar thing where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:14.390" style="s2">think a lot of the journalists had</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.560" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">actually read the memo so I remember I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.390" end="00:23:19.640" style="s2">read the entire thing and then was like</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:21.140" style="s2">wow it&#39;s not well I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.640" end="00:23:23.090" style="s2">read articles and I&#39;m trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.140" end="00:23:25.430" style="s2">where they had parsed these things</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.090" end="00:23:26.870" style="s2">together and it just didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.430" end="00:23:29.080" style="s2">gel it&#39;s like I hadn&#39;t read it and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.870" end="00:23:31.880" style="s2">think there&#39;s that sense as well all</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.080" end="00:23:32.900" style="s2">like criticism is needed and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.880" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">important that&#39;s how the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.900" end="00:23:36.830" style="s2">before but you can&#39;t criticize if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">don&#39;t engage with the ideas like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.830" end="00:23:40.100" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t criticize Freud because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:42.200" style="s2">know like a little bit about Freud don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.100" end="00:23:44.150" style="s2">know the body of his work and until I</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.200" end="00:23:46.430" style="s2">knew like a pretty decent amount I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.150" end="00:23:50.210" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t go out there saying Freud is</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.430" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">bunk so we also recorded a an interview</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.210" end="00:23:55.460" style="s2">with Tim lot who is a novelist and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:57.410" style="s2">journalist who wrote the first Spectator</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.460" end="00:23:59.570" style="s2">article about John Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.410" end="00:24:03.710" style="s2">I think around the same time as I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.570" end="00:24:06.920" style="s2">brought out my documentary really</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.710" end="00:24:09.260" style="s2">interesting guy who is described himself</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.920" end="00:24:11.990" style="s2">as an old lefty so he&#39;s kind of was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.260" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">Guardian columnist and was</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.990" end="00:24:17.480" style="s2">yeah he talks about kind of the journey</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:19.670" style="s2">that he&#39;s gone on and also the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.480" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">danger that he sees in this kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.670" end="00:24:26.450" style="s2">ideology that and the danger of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.700" end="00:24:27.770" style="s2">impacting art because effectively and he</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.450" end="00:24:31.160" style="s2">he puts this really brilliantly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.770" end="00:24:33.980" style="s2">like anyone who says I know he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.160" end="00:24:36.650" style="s2">suspicious on the idea that I know and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.980" end="00:24:38.060" style="s2">the answer is diversity and equity and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.650" end="00:24:40.910" style="s2">everything needs to be seen through this</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.060" end="00:24:43.010" style="s2">prism is ultimately a totalitarian</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.870" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">I keep coming back to like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.150" end="00:24:51.110" style="s2">sophistication and I genuinely would</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">would like to hear Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.110" end="00:24:54.860" style="s2">making this point a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">carefully because when he when he starts</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">all these things I can see the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:06.140" style="s2">whereas like as you said before fairness</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.890" end="00:25:08.600" style="s2">is a good value diversity is a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.140" end="00:25:10.730" style="s2">value if you can imagine like certainly</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.750" end="00:25:19.550" style="s2">is a positive value but if you make that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.930" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">your primary axiom and assume that</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.980" end="00:25:38.810" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s the individual that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.860" end="00:25:42.140" style="s2">matters and how could I think anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.810" end="00:25:44.630" style="s2">otherwise as a writer if any job is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.140" end="00:25:47.570" style="s2">about the individual voice it&#39;s the job</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.630" end="00:25:51.260" style="s2">of the novelist you know you know films</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.570" end="00:25:54.290" style="s2">are collective projects writing a novel</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.260" end="00:25:56.810" style="s2">is the ultimate individual acts the</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.810" end="00:26:02.300" style="s2">is coming under pressure now you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.450" end="00:26:06.020" style="s2">people they have they have I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.300" end="00:26:08.230" style="s2">they&#39;re called something like they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.700" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a really deep sickness as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.070" end="00:26:33.470" style="s2">and that is that is totalitarian thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s totalitarian thought not in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.470" end="00:26:39.220" style="s2">government but it&#39;s a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:42.049" style="s2">thought mindset that I see on the March</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.220" end="00:26:43.460" style="s2">there are a few things in the interview</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.049" end="00:26:46.429" style="s2">with Jordan Peterson I never heard him</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.460" end="00:26:48.350" style="s2">say before and the sticking point that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.429" end="00:26:50.360" style="s2">hear a lot from my sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.350" end="00:26:52.130" style="s2">progressive friends is you all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.360" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">primary focus is on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.130" end="00:26:55.580" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s too bad for them</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:58.429" style="s2">because the primary focus should be on</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.580" end="00:27:01.429" style="s2">you know I can agree with that but what</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.429" end="00:27:03.590" style="s2">I the the paradox that they would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.429" end="00:27:06.019" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay focus on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.590" end="00:27:08.090" style="s2">but you have to accept that there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.019" end="00:27:10.100" style="s2">some situations that are much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.090" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">conducive to an individual thriving than</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.100" end="00:27:14.210" style="s2">other situations so their focus is on</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:15.799" style="s2">structural inequality you&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.210" end="00:27:17.570" style="s2">the individual is there not some</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.799" end="00:27:19.700" style="s2">interplay between oh definitely well</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.570" end="00:27:21.769" style="s2">obviously because people do have group</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.700" end="00:27:24.379" style="s2">identities the question is whether</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.769" end="00:27:26.389" style="s2">whether the group or the individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.379" end="00:27:28.519" style="s2">identity should be paramount and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.389" end="00:27:31.970" style="s2">left distance the radical leftist answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.519" end="00:27:33.740" style="s2">is well there is the look it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.970" end="00:27:35.450" style="s2">that&#39;s failing to take into account</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.740" end="00:27:37.309" style="s2">those two levels of analysis it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.450" end="00:27:40.210" style="s2">bloody radical leftist because for them</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.309" end="00:27:43.490" style="s2">it&#39;s the collective and that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.210" end="00:27:46.309" style="s2">so it&#39;s obvious as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.490" end="00:27:48.019" style="s2">that people have their individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.309" end="00:27:50.090" style="s2">then behind that they have their they</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.019" end="00:27:51.860" style="s2">have their group like multiple group</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.090" end="00:27:53.870" style="s2">identities which is also a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.860" end="00:27:55.250" style="s2">but all separately or any of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.870" end="00:27:56.659" style="s2">situations that make it much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.250" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">difficult for people to self actualize</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.659" end="00:28:00.950" style="s2">well what I think they&#39;d argue is they</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:02.450" style="s2">don&#39;t hear you talk about that very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.950" end="00:28:04.820" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t first of all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.450" end="00:28:06.649" style="s2">self-evident like I&#39;m not I don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.820" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.649" end="00:28:09.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessarily more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:12.169" style="s2">for people who are poor to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.950" end="00:28:14.509" style="s2">self-actualize sorry I don&#39;t buy that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.169" end="00:28:16.129" style="s2">you because what that would mean think</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.509" end="00:28:18.440" style="s2">about what that would mean that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.129" end="00:28:21.590" style="s2">mean that the rich are morally superior</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.440" end="00:28:23.330" style="s2">that&#39;s what that means because they have</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.590" end="00:28:25.850" style="s2">all the opportunities to self actualize</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.330" end="00:28:26.870" style="s2">so obviously if the material conditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.850" end="00:28:28.970" style="s2">are the prerequisite for</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.870" end="00:28:30.590" style="s2">self-actualization then the rich are</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.970" end="00:28:32.389" style="s2">morally superior to the poor is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.590" end="00:28:34.730" style="s2">really an argument we want to make and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.389" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">then in fact I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.730" end="00:28:38.029" style="s2">even even</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:40.549" style="s2">vaguely reasonable because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.029" end="00:28:41.419" style="s2">things that does help build character is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.549" end="00:28:46.190" style="s2">privation</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.419" end="00:28:48.230" style="s2">now obviously starving to death is an an</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.190" end="00:28:52.610" style="s2">excess of privation</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.230" end="00:28:55.100" style="s2">so there are limit conditions but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.610" end="00:28:57.169" style="s2">it&#39;s a leftist trope that the provision</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.100" end="00:28:59.179" style="s2">of additional material resources will</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.169" end="00:29:00.110" style="s2">produce ethically superior human beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.179" end="00:29:03.019" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.110" end="00:29:04.090" style="s2">not true and in fact sometimes quite the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.019" end="00:29:07.850" style="s2">contrary</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:11.570" style="s2">so-so so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.850" end="00:29:14.629" style="s2">that argument in the least I also think</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.570" end="00:29:17.419" style="s2">that under most circumstances accepting</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.629" end="00:29:19.850" style="s2">those of exceptional privation and even</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.419" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">perhaps under those conditions in most</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.850" end="00:29:26.990" style="s2">is in most cases your best bet to move</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:28.309" style="s2">people forward is to concentrate on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.990" end="00:29:30.230" style="s2">development of their individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.309" end="00:29:32.149" style="s2">character and their individual their</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.230" end="00:29:34.490" style="s2">individual moral character fine and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.149" end="00:29:36.710" style="s2">because moral character is actually your</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.490" end="00:29:38.389" style="s2">moral character is actually the set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.710" end="00:29:40.129" style="s2">tools that you have to operate</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.389" end="00:29:41.750" style="s2">effectively in the world because</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.129" end="00:29:44.539" style="s2">otherwise morality would be of no</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.750" end="00:29:47.659" style="s2">utility and morality is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.539" end="00:29:51.049" style="s2">precisely that way which is of maximal</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.659" end="00:29:52.639" style="s2">utility and so and and the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.049" end="00:29:54.379" style="s2">objection that I would throw it at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.639" end="00:29:58.509" style="s2">radical left is well how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.379" end="00:30:01.639" style="s2">that your your emphasis on collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.509" end="00:30:04.009" style="s2">existence isn&#39;t just an abdication of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.639" end="00:30:05.929" style="s2">your personal responsibility well of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.009" end="00:30:09.169" style="s2">course it&#39;s not it&#39;s like no no no</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.929" end="00:30:12.289" style="s2">seriously here it&#39;s not that easy to</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.590" end="00:30:31.129" style="s2">especially don&#39;t buy it when I look at</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.129" end="00:30:36.289" style="s2">because all these people of stellar</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.520" end="00:31:09.909" style="s2">undeniable that certain situations are</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.470" end="00:31:13.270" style="s2">more conducive to flourishing than</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.909" end="00:31:15.220" style="s2">others but then if you expand that to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.270" end="00:31:16.870" style="s2">sort of more developmental lens which</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.220" end="00:31:18.850" style="s2">says okay that the top of the pyramid is</p>

<p begin="00:31:24.549" end="00:31:30.250" style="s2">character and and becoming kind of fully</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.250" end="00:31:36.789" style="s2">surely there are situations where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.510" end="00:31:38.200" style="s2">more easy to do that than others which</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.789" end="00:31:39.730" style="s2">is an argument I&#39;ve heard lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.200" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">make in this sort of more progressive</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.730" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">circles that I&#39;m familiar with and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:45.850" style="s2">pushed back on that in a way I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.770" style="s2">really heard before and that was to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.850" end="00:31:50.020" style="s2">that the idea of like Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.770" end="00:31:51.250" style="s2">of needs so you get the basic needs met</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.020" end="00:31:52.210" style="s2">at the top of the pyramid of</p>

<p begin="00:31:54.390" end="00:32:00.520" style="s2">implicit in that is the idea that rich</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.990" end="00:32:02.740" style="s2">people must be more moral than poor</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.520" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">people and I&#39;d never heard it framed</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.740" end="00:32:05.799" style="s2">that way that way and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:07.870" style="s2">something in that I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.799" end="00:32:12.370" style="s2">something quite profound in that this</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.870" end="00:32:14.020" style="s2">equation of more material goods will</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.370" end="00:32:16.630" style="s2">produce ethically better people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.020" end="00:32:19.860" style="s2">that&#39;s such a how a strongly held thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.630" end="00:32:22.179" style="s2">on the left and it&#39;s such a key point to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.860" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">to kind of pull apart that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.179" end="00:32:25.210" style="s2">implicit I think it&#39;s not held</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:28.270" style="s2">explicitly I think it&#39;s held in place at</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.210" end="00:32:31.960" style="s2">me by a lot of people on the left yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.270" end="00:32:34.390" style="s2">think that was one of the key moments in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.960" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">that interview for me that that and also</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.390" end="00:32:39.820" style="s2">just never thought of it in those terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:41.169" style="s2">at all and it makes me think just if it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.820" end="00:32:43.450" style="s2">makes me think of brexit as well it</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.169" end="00:32:45.490" style="s2">makes me think of a lot of the tensions</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.450" end="00:32:48.429" style="s2">that are in the society where there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.490" end="00:32:51.549" style="s2">this kind of assumed there is actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.429" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">in many parts of especially the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.549" end="00:32:58.030" style="s2">cosmopolitan city dwelling kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:58.990" style="s2">liberal of which I&#39;m probably one to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.030" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">honest</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.990" end="00:33:02.870" style="s2">there is an assumption that all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:04.100" style="s2">idiots out in the countryside are just</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.870" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">you know like Hitler really came from</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:08.059" style="s2">said deplorable z-- and you know what do</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.669" style="s2">they know they&#39;re all racist idiots</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.059" end="00:33:14.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a complete lack of respect and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.669" end="00:33:15.830" style="s2">lack of attempt at any empathy and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.450" end="00:33:17.419" style="s2">there&#39;s a dissonance within the left</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.830" end="00:33:18.919" style="s2">around that that I really think needs to</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.419" end="00:33:20.090" style="s2">be I think I said this right after</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.919" end="00:33:22.519" style="s2">breakfast as well like I&#39;m a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.090" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">post I was like we all who consider</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.519" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">ourselves progressive need to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:30.440" style="s2">progressive and be empathetic and go and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:33.320" style="s2">connect and really get to know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.440" end="00:33:35.389" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s absolutely key and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.320" end="00:33:36.230" style="s2">never really happened it hasn&#39;t maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.389" end="00:33:38.899" style="s2">will yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.230" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">yeah this is the I mean regular viewers</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.899" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">might get bored with the number of times</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:44.870" style="s2">I say this but it&#39;s the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:46.429" style="s2">liberalism it&#39;s this idea of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.870" end="00:33:48.500" style="s2">inclusivity that actually hides a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.429" end="00:33:50.659" style="s2">tribalism and pretty much everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.500" end="00:33:51.950" style="s2">the other side of that debate recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.659" end="00:33:55.419" style="s2">it as a tribalism they feel excluded</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.950" end="00:33:57.769" style="s2">they feel rejected they feel judged by</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.419" end="00:33:59.629" style="s2">liberals for want of a better word and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.769" end="00:34:01.159" style="s2">the idea this is why I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.629" end="00:34:04.070" style="s2">such a crucial conversation to be had</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.159" end="00:34:05.809" style="s2">about how does the left go about</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.070" end="00:34:07.879" style="s2">policing its boundaries and go about</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.809" end="00:34:09.950" style="s2">healing itself because the left is so</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.879" end="00:34:14.839" style="s2">dysfunctional right now and it&#39;s up in</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.950" end="00:34:17.000" style="s2">is so rejecting so clearly the people it</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.839" end="00:34:18.829" style="s2">claims to care about but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.000" end="00:34:20.389" style="s2">it loves it loves the poor in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.829" end="00:34:23.060" style="s2">abstract but hates everything they</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.389" end="00:34:24.619" style="s2">believe hates patriotism hates all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.060" end="00:34:26.599" style="s2">the things that give people meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.619" end="00:34:28.909" style="s2">groundedness and all of this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.599" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that to me is the most terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.909" end="00:34:33.619" style="s2">thing of what&#39;s happened since the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:39.829" style="s2">election of Trump and since brexit is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.619" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">that a lot of the liberal classes that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.829" end="00:34:44.510" style="s2">know are doubling down on what I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:46.490" style="s2">caused that rejection in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.510" end="00:34:48.260" style="s2">saying oh my god it&#39;s worse than we</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.490" end="00:34:50.359" style="s2">thought there&#39;s so much more racist and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.260" end="00:34:52.190" style="s2">bigoted and everything so much worse</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.359" end="00:34:55.099" style="s2">than we thought it&#39;s like well perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.190" end="00:34:57.740" style="s2">little bit less of that rejection of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.099" end="00:34:59.420" style="s2">the people who voted for for Trump and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.740" end="00:35:01.400" style="s2">brexit maybe a little bit of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.420" end="00:35:04.430" style="s2">self-reflection and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.400" end="00:35:07.579" style="s2">okay Hillary Clinton and the left you</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.430" end="00:35:08.690" style="s2">managed to lose to Donald Trump yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.579" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.690" end="00:35:11.930" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s what was really</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:12.359" style="s2">interesting about the debate with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.930" end="00:35:14.759" style="s2">guy that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.359" end="00:35:16.529" style="s2">is they really were on board with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.759" end="00:35:18.359" style="s2">question they they kind of Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.529" end="00:35:19.589" style="s2">raised as a like we need to look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.359" end="00:35:22.739" style="s2">ourselves we managed to boost it on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.589" end="00:35:24.089" style="s2">Trump yeah yeah with absolutely just</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.739" end="00:35:26.279" style="s2">just finally in that point you know as</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.089" end="00:35:28.890" style="s2">as we&#39;re talking about I&#39;m just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.279" end="00:35:31.009" style="s2">my own personal experience linked back</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.890" end="00:35:34.890" style="s2">to what Peterson says about moral virtue</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.009" end="00:35:37.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s absolutely true you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.890" end="00:35:41.640" style="s2">meet someone it&#39;s not their beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.640" end="00:35:44.369" style="s2">rank them in in my mind of how good a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.640" end="00:35:45.960" style="s2">person are they or how how trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.369" end="00:35:48.329" style="s2">are they and how authentic are they it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.960" end="00:35:50.309" style="s2">it&#39;s empathy empathy is the it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.329" end="00:35:51.690" style="s2">the driving force in a lot of it like</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.309" end="00:35:53.509" style="s2">this you know integral studies</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.690" end="00:35:55.380" style="s2">developmental models</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.509" end="00:35:57.650" style="s2">empathy is what&#39;s needed to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.380" end="00:36:00.150" style="s2">say yes and to transcend and include and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.650" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">empathy is what is lacking in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.150" end="00:36:04.200" style="s2">spheres on the left not everywhere but</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:07.140" style="s2">in a lot of it like as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.200" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s spread out fairly</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.140" end="00:36:10.859" style="s2">evenly just based purely in my own</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">experience I think it&#39;s spread out</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.859" end="00:36:16.829" style="s2">fairly evenly through class and I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">Peterson is probably right about that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.829" end="00:36:20.670" style="s2">the sense that masses hierarchy of needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:22.650" style="s2">is not the thing that gets you to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.670" end="00:36:24.450" style="s2">kind of self-actualization it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.650" end="00:36:27.029" style="s2">something else going on you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.450" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">yeah and that as well I mean I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.029" end="00:36:34.079" style="s2">within a left very leftist household and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:36.749" style="s2">I know this in myself up until kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.079" end="00:36:38.609" style="s2">yeah a while after I left home this</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.749" end="00:36:41.549" style="s2">sense of like I know the leftist mindset</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.609" end="00:36:43.019" style="s2">really well we I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.549" end="00:36:44.190" style="s2">on the left anymore so I might say we</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.019" end="00:36:46.440" style="s2">but on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.190" end="00:36:49.470" style="s2">people tend to judge each other by views</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.440" end="00:36:50.730" style="s2">like very willing to sort of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.470" end="00:36:52.499" style="s2">know if I can like this person because</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.730" end="00:36:54.569" style="s2">they think this or they think this well</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.499" end="00:36:56.039" style="s2">I know I&#39;m not sure that the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.569" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">happens quite as much on the right I</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.039" end="00:36:59.220" style="s2">think on the right people are far more</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.019" style="s2">willing to judge people by the contents</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.220" end="00:37:03.089" style="s2">of their character and by their their</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.019" end="00:37:04.710" style="s2">individual yeah by their moral character</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.089" end="00:37:06.239" style="s2">whereas on the left there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.710" end="00:37:08.339" style="s2">views that people are sort of testing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.239" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">out if you are accused of holding those</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.339" end="00:37:13.380" style="s2">then you&#39;ll be on the pale and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.819" style="s2">and I see this also like even in friends</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.380" end="00:37:16.829" style="s2">that I did I have since we started</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.819" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">putting out some content about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.829" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">Pederson there&#39;s a kind of well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.109" style="s2">sure whether I whether I approve of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:23.700" style="s2">not sure whether I like you anymore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.109" end="00:37:26.789" style="s2">not sure whether how to behave around</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.700" end="00:37:28.559" style="s2">you and that that really that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.789" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">a big thing on the left that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.559" end="00:37:32.460" style="s2">sure is the same on the right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.940" end="00:37:34.019" style="s2">think from on the right there is a great</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.460" end="00:37:35.940" style="s2">respect for individual sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.019" end="00:37:39.000" style="s2">whereas the left has a great respect for</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.940" end="00:37:40.799" style="s2">collective fairness and obviously they</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.000" end="00:37:43.380" style="s2">overlap in some ways but that respect</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.799" end="00:37:45.720" style="s2">for individual sovereignty also I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.380" end="00:37:47.700" style="s2">has an impact on it&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.720" end="00:37:48.089" style="s2">think this but that&#39;s that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.700" end="00:37:50.099" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.089" end="00:37:51.660" style="s2">and I&#39;ll stay out of my way you said</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.099" end="00:37:52.829" style="s2">have you you know we&#39;ll help each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.660" end="00:37:54.329" style="s2">if we need to but you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.829" end="00:37:56.430" style="s2">there&#39;s just pitfalls to that as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.329" end="00:37:58.019" style="s2">but I think you&#39;re just thinking out</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.430" end="00:38:00.390" style="s2">loud I wonder if some of it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.019" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">that the kind of focus on that on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.390" end="00:38:04.410" style="s2">individual you know talking about sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">of where the left has got blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.410" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">and where the right has got blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:14.099" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a good time to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:16.069" style="s2">the integral piece because we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.099" end="00:38:19.260" style="s2">talked about integral theory quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.069" end="00:38:21.450" style="s2">it&#39;s Ken Wilbur&#39;s spiral dynamics model</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.260" end="00:38:26.369" style="s2">and the idea of a developmental society</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.450" end="00:38:29.089" style="s2">that goes through certain define stages</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.369" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">as they go towards sort of more integral</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.089" end="00:38:34.619" style="s2">integral itself is like post ideology</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:38.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a space of there&#39;s an ideology at</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.619" end="00:38:40.140" style="s2">each at each level and integral is able</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.250" end="00:38:42.269" style="s2">to kind of like it it&#39;s a flexibility of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.140" end="00:38:44.490" style="s2">mind that&#39;s able to see where each of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.269" end="00:38:47.490" style="s2">the the different stages get stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.490" end="00:38:49.319" style="s2">to move beyond it so you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.490" end="00:38:52.049" style="s2">big conversations in the integral</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.319" end="00:38:54.680" style="s2">community has been whether Jordan like</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.049" end="00:38:57.059" style="s2">there&#39;s been this huge kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.680" end="00:38:58.859" style="s2">difficulty of digesting Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.059" end="00:38:59.460" style="s2">in lots of the integral communities that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.859" end="00:39:02.069" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.460" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">is he an integral thinker is he not an</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.069" end="00:39:04.890" style="s2">integral thinker</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:07.319" style="s2">he seems to incorporate so much into his</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.890" end="00:39:09.480" style="s2">worldview but is he a genuinely integral</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.319" end="00:39:11.490" style="s2">thinker so we had a great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.480" end="00:39:12.630" style="s2">with Geoff salzman of the daily Evolver</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.490" end="00:39:14.819" style="s2">where we asked him to put him on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.630" end="00:39:16.470" style="s2">spot and said he&#39;s Jordan Peterson an</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.819" end="00:39:18.299" style="s2">integral thinker and that&#39;s what he said</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.470" end="00:39:21.990" style="s2">what do you say from your perspective he</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.299" end="00:39:24.839" style="s2">is an integral thinker yes I would he is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.990" end="00:39:27.559" style="s2">able to definitely think integrally he</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.839" end="00:39:31.740" style="s2">has integral cognition as we would say</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.559" end="00:39:34.569" style="s2">his his heart in a way is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.740" end="00:39:37.269" style="s2">traditionalism in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.569" end="00:39:41.170" style="s2">in a way that I think keeps him a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.269" end="00:39:46.869" style="s2">stuck there honestly but I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.170" end="00:39:51.400" style="s2">because what he&#39;s doing is he is helping</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.869" end="00:39:53.829" style="s2">this whole strata of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.400" end="00:39:56.819" style="s2">never had traditionalism well installed</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.829" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">I think he&#39;s right I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.819" end="00:40:00.819" style="s2">Peterson is talking about the value of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:04.869" style="s2">listening to people from different</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.819" end="00:40:07.390" style="s2">political backgrounds the value of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.869" end="00:40:09.190" style="s2">exchanging ideas this is an integral</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:10.450" style="s2">viewpoint of being able to say well this</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.190" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">is what this person&#39;s believe this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.450" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">what they&#39;re supposed to believe this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:15.640" style="s2">why this is why but there&#39;s a he&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.720" end="00:40:17.950" style="s2">to sketch that out but I also agree that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.640" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">there&#39;s some probably some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.950" end="00:40:22.269" style="s2">reactivity in the way that he is towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.200" end="00:40:23.529" style="s2">the left that shows that he&#39;s not fully</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.269" end="00:40:25.930" style="s2">integral in the way that use in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.529" end="00:40:28.119" style="s2">world but then I think who is like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.930" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know anyone who I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.119" end="00:40:33.789" style="s2">say is integral all the way down yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">and Matt if C is Matt Siegal made a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.789" end="00:40:38.170" style="s2">really good point where he said we move</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:40.180" style="s2">between the different levels like not</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.170" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">integral all day long you know he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.180" end="00:40:45.369" style="s2">he can be to use a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:47.559" style="s2">integral jargon me be green and you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.369" end="00:40:48.990" style="s2">have a red reaction or amber kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.559" end="00:40:51.160" style="s2">thing so it is a constantly flowing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.990" end="00:40:53.619" style="s2">thing I think Saltzman put it really</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.160" end="00:40:57.640" style="s2">beautifully with that kind of modernist</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.619" end="00:40:59.529" style="s2">heart and integral head and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.640" end="00:41:01.450" style="s2">nothing wrong with that as well like he</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.529" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">says it doesn&#39;t matter so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.450" end="00:41:07.450" style="s2">place where I think that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:09.130" style="s2">implicit value in a lot of what Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.450" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">is saying that I haven&#39;t really heard</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.130" end="00:41:14.259" style="s2">him make explicit before and this was my</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:17.950" style="s2">this is our final clip from the Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.259" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">Peterson interview in a sense what he is</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.950" end="00:41:21.519" style="s2">arguing for is the reintegration of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:22.779" style="s2">sacred and that&#39;s what I really vote</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.519" end="00:41:24.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what I really value about what</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.779" end="00:41:26.980" style="s2">he&#39;s saying and so if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.700" end="00:41:31.089" style="s2">and that materialism as a doctrine is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.980" end="00:41:33.279" style="s2">really it deadens the world seeing</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.089" end="00:41:35.349" style="s2">ourselves as merely material parts that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.279" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">are sort of we happen to be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.349" end="00:41:39.970" style="s2">but we don&#39;t understand why is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:41.769" style="s2">obviously deeply kind of opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.970" end="00:41:44.200" style="s2">religious sense of no there&#39;s a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.769" end="00:41:45.090" style="s2">meaning we are here for a reason we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.090" end="00:41:48.870" style="s2">universe revealing itself to itself and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:51.510" style="s2">all of this the different ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.870" end="00:41:53.370" style="s2">have understanding our plates and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.510" end="00:41:55.860" style="s2">somehow we are reflecting the universe</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.370" end="00:41:59.550" style="s2">in air in our being all of these deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.860" end="00:42:02.190" style="s2">theological ideas implicit in his</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.550" end="00:42:06.030" style="s2">arguments is the sense that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.190" end="00:42:09.390" style="s2">spiritual crisis this is you and we look</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.030" end="00:42:12.120" style="s2">at for example the opioid crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.390" end="00:42:13.950" style="s2">America and the dying off of the white</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.120" end="00:42:15.660" style="s2">working class in America to me this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.950" end="00:42:20.370" style="s2">the evidence of a real spiritual void</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.660" end="00:42:23.370" style="s2">this is a real sense of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.370" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">negative effects of capitalism which can</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.370" end="00:42:29.340" style="s2">modify everything turn everything into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:31.650" style="s2">monetary value and most of the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.340" end="00:42:34.500" style="s2">people that I know or in more</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.650" end="00:42:35.790" style="s2">progressive circles are not materialist</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.500" end="00:42:37.800" style="s2">they&#39;re much more spiritually inspired</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.790" end="00:42:39.420" style="s2">and they&#39;re much more open to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.800" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">a sort of Russell Brand&#39;s message of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.420" end="00:42:42.690" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:44.910" style="s2">reflection of a deeper spiritual crisis</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.690" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">I think that&#39;s absolutely true and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.910" end="00:42:48.420" style="s2">also think that it&#39;s implicit in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:50.190" style="s2">of what Jordan Peterson is saying but he</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.420" end="00:42:54.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make it explicit so much because</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.190" end="00:42:56.460" style="s2">I think he&#39;s also got a lot of it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.330" end="00:42:58.260" style="s2">true when he defends the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.460" end="00:43:00.390" style="s2">have as the best system that we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.260" end="00:43:01.590" style="s2">created in terms of material wealth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.390" end="00:43:03.210" style="s2">by far the best system we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.590" end="00:43:05.250" style="s2">created and if you start critiquing the</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.550" end="00:43:20.940" style="s2">are true at the same time so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.420" end="00:43:22.500" style="s2">there is a way that he could reframe his</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.940" end="00:43:23.400" style="s2">message that I think would connect with</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.500" end="00:43:25.950" style="s2">a lot of the people who are currently</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.400" end="00:43:30.090" style="s2">rejecting it and this was the final clip</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.950" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna play my my sense of a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:35.490" style="s2">that they&#39;re not they&#39;re sort of from a</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.490" end="00:43:39.990" style="s2">materialist that they&#39;re sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:41.430" style="s2">spiritually aware and I i sense a kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.990" end="00:43:42.840" style="s2">of implicit message in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.430" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">saying that I&#39;d never heard made</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.840" end="00:43:48.300" style="s2">explicitly that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:49.920" style="s2">materialism is a deadening doctrine I</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.300" end="00:43:51.930" style="s2">mean you look at the opioid crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.920" end="00:43:54.360" style="s2">America you look at a lot of these if if</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.930" end="00:43:56.130" style="s2">poverty is seen as a more sort of also</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.360" end="00:43:57.900" style="s2">also as a sort of spiritual crisis or a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.130" end="00:43:59.300" style="s2">spot that crisis of the soul as much as</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.300" end="00:44:05.250" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly that like it&#39;s a real lovely</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.850" end="00:44:08.010" style="s2">thing if if poverty was caused by lack</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.250" end="00:44:10.980" style="s2">of money we could fix it really easily</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.010" end="00:44:12.450" style="s2">then but it isn&#39;t my point I think is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.980" end="00:44:14.040" style="s2">say that if if you were framing your</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.450" end="00:44:15.510" style="s2">message in that way I think there would</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.040" end="00:44:18.120" style="s2">be a lot of people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.510" end="00:44:20.100" style="s2">who&#39;d be receptive to that message sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.120" end="00:44:23.550" style="s2">of that that actually there is a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.100" end="00:44:26.040" style="s2">of that the crisis of already call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.550" end="00:44:27.660" style="s2">like worldview has real consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.040" end="00:44:28.920" style="s2">a lot of the poverty we&#39;re seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.660" end="00:44:31.040" style="s2">world is to do with this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.710" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">stripped all of the meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.700" end="00:44:41.790" style="s2">out of the world point well right well I</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:45.030" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t believe that material is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.790" end="00:44:47.340" style="s2">materialist hedonism is a sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.030" end="00:44:49.970" style="s2">solution now it&#39;s a bit more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.340" end="00:44:52.950" style="s2">than that because I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.970" end="00:44:56.100" style="s2">functional democratic systems are</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.950" end="00:44:58.620" style="s2">actually pretty good at reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.100" end="00:45:02.280" style="s2">hedonism like I&#39;m pretty happy that our</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.620" end="00:45:04.050" style="s2">system produces a variety of toothpastes</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.280" end="00:45:06.150" style="s2">and a variety of toilet papers and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.050" end="00:45:08.910" style="s2">variety of sanitary napkins all of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:11.220" style="s2">things that that are basically oriented</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.220" end="00:45:14.930" style="s2">individual creature comforts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.260" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">something about that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.930" end="00:45:21.510" style="s2">merciful and properly egalitarian and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:24.060" style="s2">a certain degree of material hedonism is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.510" end="00:45:28.320" style="s2">a good thing right because it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.060" end="00:45:31.800" style="s2">that people can have their basic needs</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.150" end="00:45:43.140" style="s2">is again why I don&#39;t really like Abraham</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.650" end="00:46:32.510" style="s2">because generally they construe the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.270" end="00:46:35.240" style="s2">individual as either the oppressor or</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.510" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">the suffering oppressed but not as the</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:43.310" style="s2">agents the problem with the oppressor or</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.580" end="00:46:45.560" style="s2">oppressed narrative is even though</p>

<p begin="00:46:45.560" end="00:46:49.100" style="s2">of us can be subdivided into so many</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.570" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">group identities that there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.100" end="00:46:53.990" style="s2">one dimension along which we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:56.420" style="s2">oppressors and that&#39;s actually when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.990" end="00:46:59.210" style="s2">been looking at what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.420" end="00:47:03.140" style="s2">aftermath of the Russian Revolution that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.210" end="00:47:06.020" style="s2">was the bloody error so to speak because</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.140" end="00:47:09.230" style="s2">you could take virtually any individual</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.020" end="00:47:11.120" style="s2">and you could find out it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.230" end="00:47:13.970" style="s2">there&#39;s one dimension of your identity</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.120" end="00:47:15.950" style="s2">that makes you an oppressor that trumps</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.970" end="00:47:18.620" style="s2">all the elements of your identity where</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.950" end="00:47:20.180" style="s2">you&#39;re a victim and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.620" end="00:47:21.740" style="s2">that is there is one element of your</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.180" end="00:47:25.310" style="s2">identity where you&#39;re an oppressor and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.740" end="00:47:26.690" style="s2">so that&#39;s sufficient justification to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.310" end="00:47:29.000" style="s2">throw you in with the Predators</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.690" end="00:47:30.770" style="s2">and do whatever is necessary to dispense</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.000" end="00:47:32.450" style="s2">with you and that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.770" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">happened in the aftermath well not only</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.450" end="00:47:36.980" style="s2">of the Russian Revolution but all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:39.620" style="s2">these radical leftist revolutions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.980" end="00:47:41.630" style="s2">like well if you&#39;re a socialist while</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.620" end="00:47:43.160" style="s2">you&#39;re not sufficiently pure from a</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.630" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">doctrinaire perspective and if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.160" end="00:47:47.660" style="s2">student well then you&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:51.020" style="s2">emerging burgeois class and if your</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.660" end="00:47:53.090" style="s2">parents were reasonably what would you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.020" end="00:47:55.580" style="s2">say efficient farmers then you&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.090" end="00:47:57.110" style="s2">of the kulaks and like it just went on</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.580" end="00:47:59.810" style="s2">and on and on and on there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.110" end="00:48:01.610" style="s2">anybody who escaped from the from being</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.810" end="00:48:03.980" style="s2">tarred with the brush of oppressor and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.610" end="00:48:06.830" style="s2">that&#39;s because that is because each of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.980" end="00:48:09.350" style="s2">us are in fact oppressors and oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.830" end="00:48:10.430" style="s2">every single person shares both of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.350" end="00:48:11.840" style="s2">things in common</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.430" end="00:48:14.420" style="s2">so the other question I aware of his</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.840" end="00:48:16.280" style="s2">blind spots so I spoke to Lena Anderson</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.420" end="00:48:18.110" style="s2">who&#39;s an author and also deeply involved</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.280" end="00:48:19.240" style="s2">in this question about what does a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.110" end="00:48:23.619" style="s2">developmental</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.240" end="00:48:26.710" style="s2">you look like and she said something</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.619" end="00:48:29.230" style="s2">that I that I&#39;ve we kind of touched on</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.710" end="00:48:30.550" style="s2">this in our podcast where we did a sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.230" end="00:48:35.980" style="s2">of constructive critique of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.550" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">Peterson which is is there a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.980" end="00:48:41.560" style="s2">theological incompleteness like he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:43.510" style="s2">bringing back he&#39;s speaking to the sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.560" end="00:48:44.619" style="s2">of masculine power of the the culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.510" end="00:48:47.170" style="s2">and in a real way</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.619" end="00:48:49.030" style="s2">saying these there are these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.170" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">very valuable hierarchies of competence</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.030" end="00:48:55.360" style="s2">there is a great story of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:59.830" style="s2">going back generations</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.360" end="00:49:01.900" style="s2">her her thought was that he he stops</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.830" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">with the kind of judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.900" end="00:49:06.520" style="s2">Abrahamic tradition and doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:07.840" style="s2">further to the sort of the mother cults</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.520" end="00:49:09.600" style="s2">and the the sort of things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.840" end="00:49:13.180" style="s2">sustained us when we were in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.600" end="00:49:14.950" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies I&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.180" end="00:49:16.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve got some sympathy with with that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.950" end="00:49:20.200" style="s2">and I&#39;d love to ask him about it because</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.540" end="00:49:23.260" style="s2">this sense that and this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.200" end="00:49:27.100" style="s2">where his idea of archetypes as timeless</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.260" end="00:49:29.020" style="s2">things that&#39;s where I start to diverge I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.100" end="00:49:31.570" style="s2">think because if they&#39;re not timeless if</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.020" end="00:49:33.340" style="s2">they&#39;ve evolved then potentially what we</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.570" end="00:49:35.140" style="s2">are experiencing at the moment is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.340" end="00:49:38.350" style="s2">shift in these archetypal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.140" end="00:49:43.450" style="s2">because we&#39;re moving from the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.350" end="00:49:46.660" style="s2">pattern of for example male and female</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.450" end="00:49:49.900" style="s2">roles based on the history of</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.660" end="00:49:51.850" style="s2">Agriculture the history of the value</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.900" end="00:49:53.859" style="s2">that males greater physical strength put</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.850" end="00:49:55.660" style="s2">on them as protectors and all of this to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.859" end="00:49:57.940" style="s2">some to a time when that&#39;s the less</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.660" end="00:50:00.070" style="s2">important so is there is there an</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.940" end="00:50:01.930" style="s2">archetypal shift going on and before</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.070" end="00:50:05.020" style="s2">that there was hunter-gather Stone Age</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.930" end="00:50:08.670" style="s2">so join me Peterson completely misses</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.020" end="00:50:13.590" style="s2">the animism of the hunter-gatherers and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.670" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">the mother earth goddess of the early</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.590" end="00:50:20.460" style="s2">farmers yeah it&#39;s a good question I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:23.830" style="s2">another way to look at that question is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.460" end="00:50:26.310" style="s2">so he is talking about I agree with with</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.830" end="00:50:29.640" style="s2">that reading you know because especially</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.310" end="00:50:31.810" style="s2">with the very psychedelic background</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.640" end="00:50:32.820" style="s2">enquiring into the nature of like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.810" end="00:50:34.230" style="s2">Divine Feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.820" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">what place I has in society in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.230" end="00:50:39.570" style="s2">history of it and you know how it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:41.460" style="s2">present in many cultures like Minoan</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.570" end="00:50:45.690" style="s2">Crete etc I mean there&#39;s a whole huge</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.460" end="00:50:47.720" style="s2">topic that is I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.690" end="00:50:51.000" style="s2">core important point</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.720" end="00:50:52.950" style="s2">what Peterson is bringing to it so is</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.000" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">this revival of you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.950" end="00:50:57.870" style="s2">revival of the divine masculine</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:51:00.840" style="s2">archetype in a lot of ways so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.870" end="00:51:03.240" style="s2">question is I think both need to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.840" end="00:51:04.770" style="s2">revived personally archetype early you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.240" end="00:51:06.510" style="s2">need the divine masculine and you need</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.770" end="00:51:09.000" style="s2">the divine feminine because right now we</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.510" end="00:51:11.600" style="s2">we kind of you have the devouring mother</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.000" end="00:51:14.490" style="s2">and you have the kind of I mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.600" end="00:51:19.260" style="s2">not in their full power male archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.490" end="00:51:21.330" style="s2">as well so which has it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.260" end="00:51:23.970" style="s2">it has to happen at the same time he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.330" end="00:51:26.250" style="s2">bringing one piece of it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.970" end="00:51:28.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a fair critique to say to at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.250" end="00:51:30.510" style="s2">get them to contextualize that to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.620" end="00:51:32.700" style="s2">don&#39;t you know to inquire into that</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.510" end="00:51:34.710" style="s2">question or the archetypes changing does</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.700" end="00:51:36.300" style="s2">that need to doesn&#39;t need to be happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.710" end="00:51:37.950" style="s2">at the same time or for some reason that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.300" end="00:51:39.360" style="s2">they need to be a revival of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.950" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">masculine archetype and then the divine</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.360" end="00:51:43.170" style="s2">feminine archetype afterwards or</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:45.030" style="s2">whatever it might be open question I</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.170" end="00:51:45.690" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good one there so yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.030" end="00:51:48.210" style="s2">is a trial</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.690" end="00:51:50.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve just overloaded people with</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.210" end="00:51:53.610" style="s2">content putting up six things at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.940" end="00:51:55.050" style="s2">same time seeing how it goes I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.610" end="00:51:56.730" style="s2">the idea is to try and start a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.050" end="00:51:58.590" style="s2">conversation the idea to try and build a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.730" end="00:52:00.150" style="s2">community and the idea is to try and</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.590" end="00:52:04.700" style="s2">create a space where we can have these</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.150" end="00:52:07.110" style="s2">conversations in a way that they become</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.700" end="00:52:08.970" style="s2">generative they become open they become</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.110" end="00:52:11.400" style="s2">constructive rather than getting dragged</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.970" end="00:52:12.810" style="s2">into the polarization that we see in an</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.400" end="00:52:14.850" style="s2">awful lot of that especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.810" end="00:52:18.270" style="s2">social media space yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.850" end="00:52:20.190" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s really key focus in rebel</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.270" end="00:52:22.890" style="s2">wisdom right now is how do we yeah have</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.190" end="00:52:25.890" style="s2">a two-way conversation a generative</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.890" end="00:52:28.740" style="s2">conversation where everyone&#39;s adding to</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.890" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">it and we collectively all of us get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.740" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">new places and you know explore new</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:35.640" style="s2">different thoughts there&#39;s only two of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:40.410" style="s2">us there&#39;s 22,000 I think other people</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.640" end="00:52:44.020" style="s2">so we&#39;ve created a discord so the link</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.410" end="00:52:46.820" style="s2">to the discord will be under the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.020" end="00:52:50.290" style="s2">obviously the the conversations in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.820" end="00:52:53.240" style="s2">comments are really valuable as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.290" end="00:52:54.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just a discord discord is a chat</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.240" end="00:52:57.079" style="s2">program it&#39;s a kind of chat platform</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.890" end="00:52:59.390" style="s2">it&#39;s really easy to use if you click the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.079" end="00:53:01.220" style="s2">link it&#39;ll take you through that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.390" end="00:53:03.320" style="s2">setting up an account and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.220" end="00:53:05.089" style="s2">we&#39;ve done that taking it on to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.320" end="00:53:08.440" style="s2">different platform is so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.089" end="00:53:10.579" style="s2">have specific moderated conversations</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.440" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">people who are really engaged can become</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.570" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s important to have it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.510" end="00:53:27.560" style="s2">somewhere outside in its own space so it</p>
