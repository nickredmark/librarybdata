<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:20.819" style="s2">wanted to dig into a little bit is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.079" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">what&#39;s today&#39;s multi-generational</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.819" end="00:02:25.079" style="s2">workforce like how does it differ from</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">the way it was back say 21 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.079" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good one although I did</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:31.379" style="s2">want to add one thing do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:34.109" style="s2">when you left Thompson and you went to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.379" end="00:02:38.069" style="s2">Network Solutions I did a brief stint</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.109" end="00:02:40.379" style="s2">with you there you had set me in to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.069" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">find out what was going on with the HR</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.379" end="00:02:45.629" style="s2">department and they quickly put a bounty</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:47.639" style="s2">on my head do you remember that I do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.629" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">thought you worked there and I looked on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.639" end="00:02:51.659" style="s2">your LinkedIn it wasn&#39;t there so I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">maybe I hallucinate it which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.659" end="00:02:55.079" style="s2">certainly possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:57.359" style="s2">I do remember giving you a lecture on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.079" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">how to live on $10,000 a year and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.359" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">thought it was there no that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:04.859" style="s2">actually when I was trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:06.329" style="s2">job at Thompson you tried to convince me</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.859" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t need to live in Arlington</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.329" end="00:03:10.739" style="s2">that I could find a cheaper place in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">Herndon that I could live off of beans</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.739" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">and lentils have all the nutrition I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">needed I mean it was it may have been a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">little it might have been $10,000 a year</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">whatever it was it was ridiculous but</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:24.329" style="s2">you know I mean the network solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">thing ended quickly because the web</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.329" end="00:03:28.829" style="s2">methods guys came to meet with you and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">you introduced me to them because they</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.829" end="00:03:33.060" style="s2">were looking for you know they were they</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:34.139" style="s2">were growing quickly right and so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.060" end="00:03:37.169" style="s2">were looking for help and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.139" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">hey go check these guys out and I was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.169" end="00:03:41.159" style="s2">little nervous at the time because I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:42.989" style="s2">worked with you for a good bit at that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.159" end="00:03:45.060" style="s2">point and obviously you know it&#39;d only</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">been a couple of months I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.060" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">weeks since I&#39;d left Thomson and been at</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">network solutions but I did end up</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:53.129" style="s2">leaving obviously with your blessing</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">you&#39;re like yeah go do it I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.129" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">gonna be a cool thing but it was a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">brief stint at network solutions done</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:01.829" style="s2">the last yeah I think you didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:05.129" style="s2">along with the HR Queen as I recall no</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.829" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">she sucked yeah that was it was not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.129" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">kind of really cool HR organization that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">we built at Thompson that was for sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:14.909" style="s2">now we agree eventually cleaned it up</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">and got it better but it was never as</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.909" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">good as the one we created from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure well and I think it also</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:23.159" style="s2">had a lot to do I mean you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">people that you had both at Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.159" end="00:04:27.180" style="s2">vice you know the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">I mean you know you had a person that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.180" end="00:04:31.920" style="s2">was much more the traditional HR right</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">but there were a lot of lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.920" end="00:04:37.980" style="s2">things askance in that culture as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">so not just HR bunch of difference for</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.980" end="00:04:44.190" style="s2">day I&#39;m sure that was a turnaround from</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:45.810" style="s2">almost top to bottom well we had two</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.190" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">good departments we had a really good</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.810" end="00:04:49.830" style="s2">finance operation and a good legal</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">operation pretty much everything else</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.830" end="00:04:55.500" style="s2">was definitely in a very serious rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:59.550" style="s2">restructure in some cases even restart</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.500" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">but we did it yep yep anyway let&#39;s hop</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:04.470" style="s2">into our into our topic the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">multi-generational workforce today and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.470" end="00:05:08.760" style="s2">compare it to when you enter the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:10.920" style="s2">workforce well I think the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.760" end="00:05:13.980" style="s2">find most interesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.920" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">workforce today is first of all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.980" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">dealing in some industries right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">dealing with the potential to have five</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:23.340" style="s2">different generations in one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.490" end="00:05:24.750" style="s2">organization and I think that just</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.340" end="00:05:27.450" style="s2">presents a whole lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.750" end="00:05:29.660" style="s2">challenges I&#39;m not necessarily bad some</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.450" end="00:05:32.220" style="s2">good but challenges nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.660" end="00:05:34.200" style="s2">particularly for managers as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:36.480" style="s2">trying to figure out you know how do I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.200" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">manage these people with different</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.480" end="00:05:42.030" style="s2">generational approaches to work and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">different needs so I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.030" end="00:05:45.930" style="s2">pretty interesting that we we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:49.290" style="s2">seen that and yet here we are you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.930" end="00:05:52.620" style="s2">everything from pre baby boomer to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.290" end="00:05:54.450" style="s2">know the current generation Z is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.620" end="00:05:56.310" style="s2">really any different than back in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.450" end="00:05:57.720" style="s2">day and we had all those generations I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.310" end="00:06:00.660" style="s2">don&#39;t think we had them at Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.720" end="00:06:02.280" style="s2">Reuters technology operation but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.660" end="00:06:05.730" style="s2">know most businesses in those days had</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.280" end="00:06:08.040" style="s2">people from 18 to 65 yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.730" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">that the difference between so if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.040" end="00:06:11.310" style="s2">think about you being the oldest and me</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">being the youngest no I&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.310" end="00:06:16.350" style="s2">kidding you weren&#39;t all this but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:17.850" style="s2">know that traditionalist what I you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.350" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">what&#39;s called the traditionalist so pre</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.850" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">baby boomer and then Gen X right I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">the Gen X that was kind of when</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">everybody was like oh my god these you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">know this Gen X group they&#39;re crazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:32.100" style="s2">they&#39;re you know asking for too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:33.930" style="s2">engaged in too much but then now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.100" end="00:06:35.449" style="s2">got you know other generations that have</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.930" end="00:06:38.090" style="s2">come since then and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.449" end="00:06:40.189" style="s2">completely different take on you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.090" end="00:06:42.590" style="s2">work how they want to work you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.189" end="00:06:44.029" style="s2">everything from simple things like when</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.590" end="00:06:45.650" style="s2">are they gonna show up you know a we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.029" end="00:06:48.469" style="s2">got a nine-to-five environment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.650" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">screw you I&#39;m not gonna do that so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.469" end="00:06:52.370" style="s2">think that just the differences in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:53.629" style="s2">generations is now so much more present</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.370" end="00:06:55.939" style="s2">but I think back then we really had</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.629" end="00:06:58.039" style="s2">probably three right that we could think</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.939" end="00:07:00.889" style="s2">of in our office yeah I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.039" end="00:07:02.839" style="s2">right today we have boomers there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.889" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">still some of them hanging around for</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.839" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">sure there&#39;s Xers and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">Millennials and then the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:09.949" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re gonna call the post</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:12.110" style="s2">Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.949" end="00:07:13.999" style="s2">I think it&#39;s gen Z so for so we went</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.110" end="00:07:16.849" style="s2">from three to sorta four though I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.999" end="00:07:19.189" style="s2">will see how different the newbies are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.849" end="00:07:21.439" style="s2">with the Millennials I sort of see them</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.189" end="00:07:23.930" style="s2">as a continuation but that that may not</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.439" end="00:07:27.020" style="s2">be right we&#39;ll see mm-hmm how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.930" end="00:07:29.930" style="s2">the Millennials and then gen Z differing</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.020" end="00:07:33.050" style="s2">from compare and contrast them with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.930" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">Gen Xers and the baby boomers in all</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.050" end="00:07:39.830" style="s2">honesty I think it really in large part</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:41.930" style="s2">has to do with the influence of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.830" end="00:07:45.589" style="s2">technology in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.930" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">I mean Generation Z I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.589" end="00:07:50.180" style="s2">true digital natives they&#39;ve they&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:52.999" style="s2">known anything different you know so and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.180" end="00:07:55.069" style="s2">that and it encompasses their life and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.999" end="00:07:57.080" style="s2">not necessarily in a bad way it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.069" end="00:07:59.689" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s who they are and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.080" end="00:08:02.029" style="s2">they see the world very differently then</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.689" end="00:08:04.099" style="s2">you know the what&#39;s left of the baby</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.029" end="00:08:06.409" style="s2">boomers and and even them you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.099" end="00:08:08.839" style="s2">Millennials at some level but I also</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.409" end="00:08:11.240" style="s2">think that that really influences their</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.839" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">appetite for it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.240" end="00:08:15.349" style="s2">traditional work it&#39;s just traditional</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:16.909" style="s2">ways of working I know that here in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.349" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">Charleston something that I found that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.909" end="00:08:24.349" style="s2">really interesting is that we&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.870" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">influx especially an influx in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.349" end="00:08:29.569" style="s2">technology so the state&#39;s trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">it really beneficial for companies you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.569" end="00:08:32.750" style="s2">know to come to South Carolina through</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:35.419" style="s2">tax incentives and and whatnot but</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.750" end="00:08:38.089" style="s2">really the people are coming here in</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.419" end="00:08:40.339" style="s2">droves because they want this quality of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.089" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">life and there&#39;s a lot of people you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.339" end="00:08:45.980" style="s2">know out of college in their 20s that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.630" style="s2">want to be here because they want easy</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:50.420" style="s2">access to the beach and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.630" end="00:08:52.850" style="s2">want the year-round climate and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.420" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">they work from home for companies all</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.850" end="00:08:58.400" style="s2">over the place</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:09:00.050" style="s2">and I I think that they just decide you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.400" end="00:09:02.120" style="s2">know for themselves what&#39;s the life</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.050" end="00:09:03.830" style="s2">gonna be that I want to live and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.120" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll figure out how to get to the work</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.830" end="00:09:07.340" style="s2">or the work will actually find me</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">because their talent is in high demand</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.340" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">so I would have never done that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:14.390" style="s2">was all about you know how am I gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">get to a you know get to work at a great</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.390" end="00:09:19.010" style="s2">company and be around you know really</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">smart people and in a position where I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.010" end="00:09:22.610" style="s2">can learn and I can you know I can grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:24.500" style="s2">and I can come and I can work my way up</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.610" end="00:09:27.290" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s their mindset</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:28.700" style="s2">does that make sense I&#39;ve seen it with</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.290" end="00:09:30.500" style="s2">some of course I&#39;ve seen it with</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:33.050" style="s2">Millennials and Xers too I mean I know</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.500" end="00:09:35.330" style="s2">Xers who you know especially as they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.050" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">gotten say a bit older said screw the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.330" end="00:09:39.800" style="s2">corporate rat race I&#39;m gonna go live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:41.900" style="s2">Portland Oregon and I&#39;m gonna get gigs</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.800" end="00:09:43.220" style="s2">on the internet so it&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.900" end="00:09:45.110" style="s2">that&#39;s an entirely new thing it may be</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.220" end="00:09:46.820" style="s2">that the percentage of people of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.110" end="00:09:49.580" style="s2">newest generation maybe a larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.820" end="00:09:51.050" style="s2">percentage of them doing it you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.580" end="00:09:53.240" style="s2">then I think it&#39;s that that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.050" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">mindset out of the chute right like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.240" end="00:09:57.020" style="s2">mean I&#39;m definitely a part of that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.310" end="00:09:58.100" style="s2">know Gen X who said yeah I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.020" end="00:09:59.450" style="s2">do that right I mean that&#39;s in large</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.100" end="00:10:01.010" style="s2">part where I went to consulting because</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.450" end="00:10:02.390" style="s2">I kind of foolishly thought the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.010" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">consulting would be something that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.390" end="00:10:06.920" style="s2">could you know would give me more</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:10.520" style="s2">freedom and that&#39;s not the case but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.920" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">think especially Generation Z is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.520" end="00:10:16.310" style="s2">way out of the gate their personal lives</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:17.840" style="s2">and their careers are not different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.310" end="00:10:21.530" style="s2">kind of one in the same and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.840" end="00:10:24.260" style="s2">driving you know their life and and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.530" end="00:10:25.970" style="s2">ways that they want to work and where</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.260" end="00:10:27.770" style="s2">they want to live in all of that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.970" end="00:10:30.380" style="s2">know on on their own and I&#39;ve I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.770" end="00:10:33.140" style="s2">know that I&#39;ve ever known you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.380" end="00:10:35.870" style="s2">of more a gutsy er I think generation</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.140" end="00:10:37.910" style="s2">from that perspective it kind of reminds</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.870" end="00:10:39.290" style="s2">me of the Boomers when we were young you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.910" end="00:10:41.810" style="s2">know hell I hitchhiked around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.290" end="00:10:44.210" style="s2">country for two years screwed around did</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.810" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">this and that slept under bridges didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.210" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">really give too much of a fuck about</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:50.570" style="s2">career for a couple years and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">and quit jobs to go do startups based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.570" end="00:10:55.220" style="s2">the the sketchiest imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:56.990" style="s2">fundraising and so I think there fair</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.220" end="00:10:59.150" style="s2">number of us boomers were like that too</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:11:01.100" style="s2">you know fact I&#39;ve often said that I see</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.150" end="00:11:03.380" style="s2">a lot of similarities between boomer</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.100" end="00:11:05.270" style="s2">Millennials and maybe even more with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.380" end="00:11:08.300" style="s2">new gen Z&#39;s or whatever they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.270" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">called you know let&#39;s set on having to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.300" end="00:11:12.260" style="s2">follow our nose through a career so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">see that it&#39;s a good thing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.260" end="00:11:17.540" style="s2">not that different than the kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:19.670" style="s2">at least the hippie-ish aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.540" end="00:11:20.840" style="s2">Boomers I can see that and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.670" end="00:11:23.840" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot about especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.840" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">Generation Z that&#39;s still undefined but</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.840" end="00:11:28.010" style="s2">I think that to your point you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:29.900" style="s2">they&#39;re very community oriented people</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.010" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">you know I think we see that play out</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.900" end="00:11:33.770" style="s2">obviously a lot on social media which</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">they&#39;re very comfortable with and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.770" end="00:11:36.080" style="s2">think there&#39;s a good in the bad aspect</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">to that but nonetheless I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.080" end="00:11:40.910" style="s2">very in the very community-oriented I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:43.520" style="s2">think that they&#39;re very I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.910" end="00:11:47.390" style="s2">they&#39;re realistic at you know similar I</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.520" end="00:11:48.620" style="s2">think to to boomers but again I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.390" end="00:11:51.500" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s parts of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.620" end="00:11:55.100" style="s2">generation that are still evolving and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.500" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">undefined that&#39;s for sure and I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:12:00.650" style="s2">suspect that the kinds of digital nomads</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:03.980" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about are very heavily</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.650" end="00:12:05.810" style="s2">concentrated in the cognitive elite you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.980" end="00:12:10.670" style="s2">know people who do things like computer</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.810" end="00:12:13.400" style="s2">programming or video editing or you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.670" end="00:12:15.140" style="s2">podcasting I suspect like in every</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.400" end="00:12:17.060" style="s2">demographic group the vast preponderance</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.140" end="00:12:20.030" style="s2">of people have you know fairly normal</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.060" end="00:12:22.190" style="s2">jobs you know work at Walmart or you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.030" end="00:12:24.350" style="s2">know work in a you know in an Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.190" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">warehouse or what-have-you so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.350" end="00:12:29.210" style="s2">should be a little careful to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:31.640" style="s2">that this conversation is most likely</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.210" end="00:12:34.970" style="s2">about the college-educated cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.640" end="00:12:36.950" style="s2">elite and probably working in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.970" end="00:12:39.890" style="s2">heavily tech influenced careers</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.950" end="00:12:41.480" style="s2">absolutely yeah and I had you know again</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.890" end="00:12:43.940" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s a lot of you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.480" end="00:12:46.450" style="s2">surround myself here in Charleston with</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.940" end="00:12:49.820" style="s2">right is is some of the technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.450" end="00:12:51.530" style="s2">startups and technology companies in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.820" end="00:12:52.910" style="s2">general that are and there&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.530" end="00:12:54.670" style="s2">know this isn&#39;t like there&#39;s not a ton</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.910" end="00:12:58.460" style="s2">of them but there&#39;s a good and growing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.670" end="00:13:00.020" style="s2">number and you know the struggle I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.460" end="00:13:03.260" style="s2">for any company quite frankly but</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.020" end="00:13:04.910" style="s2">certainly in in technology with talent</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.260" end="00:13:06.080" style="s2">and being able to find talent in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.910" end="00:13:08.390" style="s2">some of the interesting things I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.080" end="00:13:11.030" style="s2">you know since I left the DC area that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.390" end="00:13:14.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to do is really help DC</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.030" end="00:13:16.610" style="s2">based companies that need talent you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.660" end="00:13:19.490" style="s2">know especially technical talent access</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.610" end="00:13:21.560" style="s2">that down here you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.490" end="00:13:23.900" style="s2">expensive and quite frankly in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.560" end="00:13:25.970" style="s2">it&#39;s better quality because I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.900" end="00:13:27.830" style="s2">can get all kinds of quality but that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.970" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s saturated you know and now that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.830" end="00:13:32.810" style="s2">Amazon is opening up a big footprint up</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.610" style="s2">in the DC area I mean it&#39;s gonna become</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.810" end="00:13:36.530" style="s2">more so but but yes for sure I agree</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.610" end="00:13:38.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really the the tech sector</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.530" end="00:13:41.180" style="s2">that were or the the tech community that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.630" end="00:13:43.190" style="s2">that we&#39;re speaking to yeah the DC area</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.180" end="00:13:45.470" style="s2">was kind of an interesting place to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.190" end="00:13:47.750" style="s2">build tech companies what I remember of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.470" end="00:13:50.600" style="s2">it was it was dominated by the Beltway</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.750" end="00:13:52.820" style="s2">bandits and the and the Beltway bandits</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.600" end="00:13:55.070" style="s2">had a strength and a weakness one they</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.820" end="00:13:56.780" style="s2">had a zillion jobs but the weakness was</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.070" end="00:13:59.630" style="s2">because the way they had to pay people</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.780" end="00:14:02.300" style="s2">based on government contracting scales a</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.630" end="00:14:04.940" style="s2">player&#39;s got paid the same as C players</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.300" end="00:14:07.070" style="s2">so if you remember our strategy was to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.940" end="00:14:09.710" style="s2">essentially strip-mine the Beltway</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.070" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">bandits and steal all their a players</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.710" end="00:14:13.880" style="s2">and and some of their better B players</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:16.100" style="s2">and leave them with the C players but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.880" end="00:14:18.590" style="s2">still remember Bob Hall who was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.100" end="00:14:20.630" style="s2">our rabbi at Thompson corporate</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.590" end="00:14:22.700" style="s2">headquarters he was on like the Business</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.630" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">Roundtable or something and he&#39;s gotten</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.700" end="00:14:27.260" style="s2">a call from one of the big-time CEOs at</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:30.440" style="s2">one of the Beltway bandits saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.260" end="00:14:32.690" style="s2">Bob your Thompson Technology Group down</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.440" end="00:14:34.340" style="s2">there in DC is you know they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.690" end="00:14:35.990" style="s2">very very aggressive in their recruiting</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.340" end="00:14:38.210" style="s2">they&#39;re grabbing a whole bunch of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.990" end="00:14:40.310" style="s2">best people you know please tell them to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.210" end="00:14:41.900" style="s2">stop there&#39;s any way Bob immediately got</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.310" end="00:14:43.010" style="s2">on the phone and called me up and said</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.900" end="00:14:44.210" style="s2">hey Jim I don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.010" end="00:14:46.460" style="s2">you&#39;re doing but I got this call from</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.210" end="00:14:49.010" style="s2">blah blah blah blah who I won&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.460" end="00:14:55.370" style="s2">and whatever you&#39;re doing keep doing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.010" end="00:14:56.960" style="s2">and so we did yeah I mean and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.370" end="00:14:58.910" style="s2">you know nah I mean we had a little but</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.960" end="00:15:01.370" style="s2">I had a little bit of experience out in</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.910" end="00:15:03.110" style="s2">California in my web methods days</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.370" end="00:15:05.540" style="s2">because we had an office out there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.110" end="00:15:07.310" style="s2">had made a couple of acquisitions out</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.540" end="00:15:09.950" style="s2">there but I mean the technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.310" end="00:15:11.750" style="s2">environment in DC yeah I mean it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.950" end="00:15:14.090" style="s2">know everybody&#39;s getting into that game</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.750" end="00:15:15.620" style="s2">right and so and you&#39;ve got you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.090" end="00:15:18.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your Beltway bandits which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.620" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">different than other you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.170" end="00:15:21.020" style="s2">San Francisco&#39;s the New York&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:24.100" style="s2">Boston&#39;s they don&#39;t have that massive</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.020" end="00:15:26.199" style="s2">federal government influence</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.100" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a bear for them to be able to pay</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.199" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">for the type of talent that they want</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:32.949" style="s2">which leaves it you know makes it</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:35.860" style="s2">interesting for technology companies to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.949" end="00:15:37.540" style="s2">be able to go in and grab people but you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.860" end="00:15:39.339" style="s2">know is a very aggressive environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.540" end="00:15:41.230" style="s2">nonetheless to recruit in I mean we had</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.339" end="00:15:43.329" style="s2">to pull out all the stops yeah and again</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.230" end="00:15:46.089" style="s2">you have to use tricks as we did right</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.329" end="00:15:48.699" style="s2">we differentiated ourselves I still</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.089" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">remember one of the problems with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.699" end="00:15:52.839" style="s2">Beltway bandits is they make everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.050" end="00:15:54.579" style="s2">take drug tests so we decided screw that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.839" end="00:15:56.500" style="s2">if you want to smoke reefer go right</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.579" end="00:15:58.420" style="s2">ahead in fact I fought a big battle with</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.500" end="00:16:00.040" style="s2">that clown who was the head of HR at</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.420" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">Thomson at the time who was that weasel</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.040" end="00:16:04.839" style="s2">I remember the name now anyway he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">to force us to it to do drug tests and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.839" end="00:16:09.399" style="s2">wrote a letter to the CEO of Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.870" end="00:16:11.470" style="s2">making the argument saying I&#39;ll get my</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.399" end="00:16:14.680" style="s2">shitter people smoked reefer blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.470" end="00:16:17.110" style="s2">blah and I will I&#39;ll give him credit he</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.680" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">sided with us and said if that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.110" end="00:16:22.660" style="s2">your competitive recruiting advantages</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:24.519" style="s2">then go for it so we did yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.660" end="00:16:26.709" style="s2">remember you know back in the day - I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.519" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">mean we you know when Thompson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.709" end="00:16:32.500" style="s2">strategy was really you know shifting</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">right to become more technology focused</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.500" end="00:16:36.490" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s crazy to think about you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.680" style="s2">know that particular point in my career</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.490" end="00:16:40.329" style="s2">I mean obviously I was very young but</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.680" end="00:16:43.389" style="s2">that point in time I mean I was a big</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.329" end="00:16:44.889" style="s2">inflection point for Thompson right to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.389" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">really go from you know more of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.889" end="00:16:49.480" style="s2">traditional brick and mortar to just</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:51.399" style="s2">using technology and new ways to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.480" end="00:16:53.620" style="s2">data to deliver information but remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.399" end="00:16:56.529" style="s2">we had a big college recruiting effort</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.620" end="00:16:59.649" style="s2">all over the country and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.529" end="00:17:01.630" style="s2">the Harvey muds and the mi t--&#39;s and all</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.649" end="00:17:05.020" style="s2">kinds of awesome schools with great</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.630" end="00:17:06.490" style="s2">computer science programs and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.020" end="00:17:08.260" style="s2">that was a benefit even in those</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.490" end="00:17:10.089" style="s2">environments because a lot of the places</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.260" end="00:17:11.860" style="s2">that there was those kids were looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.089" end="00:17:13.809" style="s2">to go to work we&#39;re still you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.860" end="00:17:15.819" style="s2">of have the stiff upper lip right and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.809" end="00:17:19.260" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have that where we were trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.819" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">to not have that you know that brand</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.260" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">yeah we had to communicate the brand -</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">right as you know I famously said fuck</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.900" style="s2">at least once in every time I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:31.059" style="s2">interviewing somebody for a potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.900" end="00:17:32.950" style="s2">job because I didn&#39;t want them to get a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.059" end="00:17:34.419" style="s2">false perception of what our place was</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.950" end="00:17:36.190" style="s2">like right you know we&#39;re the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.419" end="00:17:37.630" style="s2">place where the CEO says fuck if he</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.190" end="00:17:39.880" style="s2">feels like it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.630" end="00:17:41.230" style="s2">whenever I think about recruiting for</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.880" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">instance when I write ads I used to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.230" end="00:17:46.780" style="s2">write a lot of recruiting ads and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:48.790" style="s2">wrote them to both attract and repel I</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.780" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">want to attract the people we want but</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.790" end="00:17:53.650" style="s2">frankly I wanted to repel kind of rigid</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">people who weren&#39;t gonna fit into our</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.650" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">culture I suspect all that today would</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:18:00.220" style="s2">get me an HR jail but oh well it worked</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:02.920" style="s2">back in the day yeah you created a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.220" end="00:18:04.360" style="s2">narrow funnel for us yeah oh of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.920" end="00:18:07.180" style="s2">we got lots of names there I remember</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.360" end="00:18:09.340" style="s2">the radio advertising we used to do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.180" end="00:18:10.930" style="s2">they used to bring us large numbers of I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.340" end="00:18:12.760" style="s2">thought pretty good actually brought us</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.930" end="00:18:14.680" style="s2">all kinds of crazy stuff but you know in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.760" end="00:18:16.570" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.680" end="00:18:18.100" style="s2">wrong with creating a narrow funnel I</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.570" end="00:18:21.550" style="s2">mean it takes too much time and an</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.100" end="00:18:24.010" style="s2">effort from you know your HR team to I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.550" end="00:18:25.870" style="s2">mean good lord you know when I was at</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.010" end="00:18:28.660" style="s2">web methods we went through thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.870" end="00:18:30.970" style="s2">resumes and you know you just you needed</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.660" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">the ability to really cut through all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.970" end="00:18:36.130" style="s2">that paper reading and figure out you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:37.980" style="s2">know both in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.130" end="00:18:40.270" style="s2">experience and skills as well as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.980" end="00:18:41.680" style="s2">personality and cultural fit like how</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.270" end="00:18:43.150" style="s2">you know who we gonna pick up the phone</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.680" end="00:18:45.160" style="s2">and call and who do we want to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.150" end="00:18:47.650" style="s2">to interview I mean you need to create</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.160" end="00:18:49.060" style="s2">that that narrow funnel so you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.650" end="00:18:50.800" style="s2">saying all that to give you kudos</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.060" end="00:18:52.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s in my mind it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.800" end="00:18:55.000" style="s2">thing you want to cut out who you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.510" end="00:18:56.380" style="s2">who needs to go as fast as you can yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.000" end="00:18:57.550" style="s2">I think that was the big problem within</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.380" end="00:18:59.170" style="s2">this while we had a nice unfair</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.550" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">advantage against most of those DC</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.170" end="00:19:03.580" style="s2">people they were bland and bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:05.590" style="s2">to a fault right you read their ads and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.580" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">no one could tell whether this was for</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.590" end="00:19:08.140" style="s2">them or not</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:09.580" style="s2">right so they send their resume and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.140" end="00:19:12.430" style="s2">they ever got every Tom Dick and Harry</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.580" end="00:19:13.510" style="s2">well we did the repulsor attractor thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.430" end="00:19:15.400" style="s2">and as you said we got a more</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.510" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">concentrated flow and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.400" end="00:19:20.380" style="s2">right way to do it yeah okay let&#39;s go on</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">to the next topic something we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.380" end="00:19:25.960" style="s2">about over the years is leadership what</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:28.630" style="s2">it means you know is it changing what</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.960" end="00:19:30.100" style="s2">are the challenges you know what do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.630" end="00:19:33.220" style="s2">see out there in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.100" end="00:19:35.380" style="s2">leadership and business land today well</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:38.950" style="s2">as always I mean I think the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.380" end="00:19:41.830" style="s2">leadership is is a fascinating one and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:43.810" style="s2">think that especially in what I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.830" end="00:19:46.360" style="s2">specifically because a lot of it is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.810" end="00:19:48.520" style="s2">just you know I I work with leaders I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.360" end="00:19:50.460" style="s2">a lot of individual coaching I also do a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.520" end="00:19:53.180" style="s2">lot of team level work</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.460" end="00:19:55.860" style="s2">and I really have seen a big shift to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.180" end="00:19:57.300" style="s2">number one people who don&#39;t you know who</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.860" end="00:19:59.820" style="s2">get into leadership positions in them</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.300" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">and they don&#39;t you know kind of stay</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.820" end="00:20:04.800" style="s2">still they&#39;re evolving they&#39;re openly</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:07.290" style="s2">evolving and they&#39;re very they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.800" end="00:20:09.210" style="s2">inclusive they are they&#39;re inclusive of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.290" end="00:20:11.580" style="s2">the not just their leadership teams but</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.210" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">the broader organizations around them</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.580" end="00:20:17.400" style="s2">which i think is is fascinating and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">think it leads to you know i think i can</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.400" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">i think it can lead to some scary things</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:23.160" style="s2">for leaders I mean some vulnerabilities</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:24.840" style="s2">and kind of exposing things about</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.160" end="00:20:27.030" style="s2">yourself that might not be you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.840" end="00:20:28.950" style="s2">textbook but I do think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.030" end="00:20:32.580" style="s2">different then you know kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.950" end="00:20:34.830" style="s2">you know maybe well 10 15 years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:36.870" style="s2">think leadership has evolved that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.830" end="00:20:39.240" style="s2">topic of leadership learning about</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.870" end="00:20:41.670" style="s2">leadership learning to become a leader I</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.240" end="00:20:44.460" style="s2">think that has all I think it&#39;s evolved</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.670" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">quite quite a bit so you say the net</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.460" end="00:20:48.420" style="s2">result is leadership&#39;s on average better</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:50.070" style="s2">today than it was 15 years ago in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.420" end="00:20:51.780" style="s2">experience I don&#39;t know that I can say</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.070" end="00:20:53.670" style="s2">that it&#39;s better or worse organizations</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.780" end="00:20:55.770" style="s2">writ large or different right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.670" end="00:21:00.740" style="s2">we&#39;re organizations really no matter I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.770" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">mean in large part are evolving too and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.740" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">I just feel like nothing stays in place</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:10.140" style="s2">for very long anymore and that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:12.690" style="s2">leaders that recognize that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.140" end="00:21:14.910" style="s2">are creating capability within their</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.690" end="00:21:18.890" style="s2">organizations to kind of harness that</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.910" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">power of of change and evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.890" end="00:21:23.550" style="s2">they don&#39;t just expect it from you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:26.430" style="s2">kind of the broader organization and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.550" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">teams but they they understand good</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.430" end="00:21:29.910" style="s2">leaders that I&#39;ve that I have worked</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:31.560" style="s2">with and I don&#39;t work with all good</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.910" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">leaders but that I have worked with</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.560" end="00:21:36.420" style="s2">really understand how that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:39.060" style="s2">evolutionary aspect to them even that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.420" end="00:21:41.070" style="s2">you know is associated with that so not</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.060" end="00:21:43.230" style="s2">good not bad just different and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.070" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">changing not staying the same right</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.230" end="00:21:47.610" style="s2">leadership isn&#39;t the same I think 15</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:50.700" style="s2">years ago than it is today</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.610" end="00:21:52.650" style="s2">because of the change the pace of change</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.700" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">that we see in organizations does that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.650" end="00:21:56.340" style="s2">make sense yeah and I think I like what</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:58.140" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing here you know as you know I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.340" end="00:22:00.930" style="s2">basically retired from the business</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.140" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">world 20 years ago which is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.930" end="00:22:04.370" style="s2">believe but it is almost that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.400" style="s2">quite 2018 you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.370" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">ago and back then we had you know some</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.400" end="00:22:11.540" style="s2">of that flexible leadership that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">talked about but particularly in larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.540" end="00:22:15.559" style="s2">organizations it was not the rule there</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:17.480" style="s2">was a lot of people who you know came up</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.559" end="00:22:19.850" style="s2">a hierarchical structure and felt most</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.480" end="00:22:21.950" style="s2">comfortable in a well-defined the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.850" end="00:22:24.500" style="s2">hierarchical structure with boxes on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.950" end="00:22:25.940" style="s2">chart and all that sort of stuff and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.500" end="00:22:27.830" style="s2">know we obviously didn&#39;t operate that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.940" end="00:22:30.020" style="s2">way but we had to be very very careful</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.830" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">in selecting out those people who we</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.020" end="00:22:33.860" style="s2">thought had leadership capabilities in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.980" style="s2">more dynamic environment sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.860" end="00:22:38.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more such people today I</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.980" end="00:22:40.190" style="s2">definitely think so and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.420" end="00:22:41.690" style="s2">are I mean there&#39;s a lot of research out</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.190" end="00:22:44.300" style="s2">there about you know the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.690" end="00:22:45.860" style="s2">hierarchy so when you think about some</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.300" end="00:22:48.350" style="s2">people I don&#39;t particularly care for it</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.860" end="00:22:51.740" style="s2">use the church quote/unquote as an</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.350" end="00:22:54.860" style="s2">example or the the police force as an</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.740" end="00:22:56.920" style="s2">example of the military as why hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.860" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">can be important and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.920" end="00:23:03.470" style="s2">I think there&#39;s benefit from from less</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:05.000" style="s2">structure and that and we see that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.470" end="00:23:07.040" style="s2">know maybe not in those types of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.000" end="00:23:08.390" style="s2">organizations but we think we do see</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.040" end="00:23:10.520" style="s2">that being a little bit more pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.390" end="00:23:13.250" style="s2">you know that that you don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.520" end="00:23:15.800" style="s2">org chart view or charge drive me</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.250" end="00:23:17.809" style="s2">freaking crazy you don&#39;t have you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.800" end="00:23:19.429" style="s2">not every organization thinks of itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.809" end="00:23:21.650" style="s2">in terms of how you know and people</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.429" end="00:23:23.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think of themselves in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.650" end="00:23:26.660" style="s2">where they fall on an org chart it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.960" end="00:23:29.480" style="s2">lot more fluid and it&#39;s a lot more flat</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.660" end="00:23:31.460" style="s2">right yep and some of that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.480" end="00:23:33.710" style="s2">good but I also think there&#39;s some risks</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:35.330" style="s2">associated with it as you may recall we</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.710" end="00:23:37.220" style="s2">always had an org chart but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.330" end="00:23:38.929" style="s2">worship it we move stuff around we</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.220" end="00:23:42.020" style="s2">redefine things on the fly</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.929" end="00:23:44.450" style="s2">etc but I do think it is useful for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.020" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">org chart to exist but just not for it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.450" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">to be worshipped I have seen some</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:50.450" style="s2">companies that try to go with completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:51.950" style="s2">without the org chart and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.450" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">still out on the evidence and whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where that really works or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:58.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a company called valve which</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.460" end="00:24:15.020" style="s2">organization they may be finding might</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.710" end="00:24:16.760" style="s2">be necessary you know but back to your</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.020" end="00:24:18.150" style="s2">other point it&#39;s hard to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.760" end="00:24:21.510" style="s2">somebody could operate</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.150" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">in the old 1975 command-and-control</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.510" end="00:24:25.740" style="s2">structure and today&#39;s very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:28.620" style="s2">changing environment every business</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.740" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">almost is being reinvented every few</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.620" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">years you know the speed of change</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:36.120" style="s2">brought on by technology by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:38.100" style="s2">marketplace by globalism it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.120" end="00:24:40.530" style="s2">and if you&#39;re not prepared to adapt yep</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.100" end="00:24:42.750" style="s2">much more rapidly than you were 1975</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.530" end="00:24:45.540" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be dead how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.750" end="00:24:48.180" style="s2">the speed of change as a stressor to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.540" end="00:24:50.190" style="s2">management and organizations well let me</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.180" end="00:24:53.220" style="s2">just say I also find it amazing how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.190" end="00:24:55.320" style="s2">companies try to create this extranet</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.220" end="00:24:57.450" style="s2">try they do create an external brand</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.320" end="00:25:00.120" style="s2">that does not reflect really who they</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.450" end="00:25:01.530" style="s2">are inside and I think that is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.120" end="00:25:03.660" style="s2">think I know that is something that just</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.530" end="00:25:05.850" style="s2">absolutely drives me crazy because</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.660" end="00:25:07.230" style="s2">number one it&#39;s false advertising but</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.850" end="00:25:09.690" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of companies I</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.230" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2">think you don&#39;t know how to act don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.690" end="00:25:13.020" style="s2">know how to behave don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:16.110" style="s2">manage don&#39;t know how to lead don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.020" end="00:25:19.140" style="s2">how to operate outside of that tight</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.110" end="00:25:21.990" style="s2">command and control traditional top up</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.140" end="00:25:23.880" style="s2">bottom down type of structure and yet</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.990" end="00:25:26.130" style="s2">there they are force at some level to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.880" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">you know create a brand especially when</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.130" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">it become comes to talent attraction</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:31.110" style="s2">right but they they create a brand and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:33.030" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re not even forced they just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.110" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">do it because that&#39;s the evolution right</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.030" end="00:25:38.820" style="s2">but it&#39;s not true to how they who they</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:40.710" style="s2">really are and I see a good bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.820" end="00:25:42.690" style="s2">and that creates organizational</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.710" end="00:25:43.800" style="s2">challenges as well you know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.690" end="00:25:46.020" style="s2">think in terms of the pace of change</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.800" end="00:25:48.090" style="s2">it&#39;s I think sometimes it can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.020" end="00:25:49.670" style="s2">industry specific but there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.090" end="00:25:53.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s I think it&#39;s tightly</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.670" end="00:25:55.230" style="s2">coupled with technology and how</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.130" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">pervasive technology is within your</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.230" end="00:25:59.010" style="s2">organization I mean there I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:01.470" style="s2">that there are many types of companies</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.010" end="00:26:04.010" style="s2">and organizations anymore that don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.470" end="00:26:07.170" style="s2">technology right whether it&#39;s just for</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.010" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">internal email you know what have you</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.170" end="00:26:13.080" style="s2">all the way to technology playing some</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:14.580" style="s2">major role in our offering and whether</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.080" end="00:26:16.050" style="s2">it&#39;s you know you you physically build</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.580" end="00:26:18.030" style="s2">something but you&#39;ve got a supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.050" end="00:26:20.100" style="s2">and so you&#39;re using technology from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.030" end="00:26:22.680" style="s2">perspective to you are a technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.100" end="00:26:25.770" style="s2">company I think the use of technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.680" end="00:26:29.070" style="s2">has always been in the past you know ten</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.770" end="00:26:31.230" style="s2">plus years the major driver of change I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.070" end="00:26:31.500" style="s2">think the thing that I tried to foot</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.230" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.500" end="00:26:36.300" style="s2">for a long time especially with leaders</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:39.390" style="s2">was you know really understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.300" end="00:26:41.550" style="s2">culture and change right um and at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.390" end="00:26:44.610" style="s2">different level than they had before and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.550" end="00:26:46.050" style="s2">and starting to think about change from</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.610" end="00:26:48.450" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not gonna send your</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.050" end="00:26:50.910" style="s2">leaders just out to go get trained or</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.450" end="00:26:53.310" style="s2">your managers on good change management</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.910" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">skills right it&#39;s you can&#39;t boil this</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.310" end="00:27:00.900" style="s2">stuff down to a two day training seminar</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:02.910" style="s2">or you know a matrix of steps that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.900" end="00:27:04.770" style="s2">need to take in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.910" end="00:27:06.600" style="s2">manage quote-unquote change within your</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.770" end="00:27:09.930" style="s2">organization that&#39;s really a mindset</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.600" end="00:27:13.350" style="s2">shift and that you know having that talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.930" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">about mindset and what that change you</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.350" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">know and working with people to really</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:18.690" style="s2">go through that change where they can</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:20.730" style="s2">accept change they know how to work in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.690" end="00:27:22.410" style="s2">it they they know how to manage in it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.730" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">they know how to lead in it I think is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.410" end="00:27:26.250" style="s2">been a big inflection point within you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:27.660" style="s2">know organizations and and for</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.250" end="00:27:28.670" style="s2">individuals as well you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.660" end="00:27:34.050" style="s2">doing it better than they used to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.670" end="00:27:35.910" style="s2">managing change yeah um yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.050" end="00:27:37.650" style="s2">think that there&#39;s more organizations</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.910" end="00:27:40.290" style="s2">that are better at it now than they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.650" end="00:27:42.450" style="s2">in the past and I think there are more</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.290" end="00:27:45.930" style="s2">and more organizations that are starting</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.450" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">to harness that power that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.930" end="00:27:50.430" style="s2">that energy that evolution so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:52.200" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the air they breathe</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.430" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">right it&#39;s not this thing that comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.200" end="00:27:57.000" style="s2">around and like socks them upside the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:27:59.640" style="s2">head but they&#39;re learning how to really</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.000" end="00:28:00.810" style="s2">an you know kind of embrace it more but</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.640" end="00:28:02.760" style="s2">I think that&#39;s so I mean it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.810" end="00:28:04.260" style="s2">prevalent to the world we live in today</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.760" end="00:28:06.990" style="s2">I mean you can&#39;t how you get away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.260" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">it exactly you know one would expect if</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.990" end="00:28:10.770" style="s2">nothing else you know evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.940" end="00:28:12.900" style="s2">pruning would make people better it</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.770" end="00:28:15.210" style="s2">changes that rate of change continues to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.900" end="00:28:16.980" style="s2">accelerate those companies that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.210" end="00:28:18.450" style="s2">figured out how to manage and a highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.980" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">changing environment a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.450" end="00:28:24.330" style="s2">gonna die right remember the example</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">back in the DC area we had a really big</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.330" end="00:28:28.230" style="s2">home improvements chain called Hechinger</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">x&#39; kind of like a home depot or</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.230" end="00:28:32.400" style="s2">something like that and the covered</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:35.460" style="s2">Maryland and Delaware and Pennsylvania</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.400" end="00:28:37.950" style="s2">parts of Virginia and they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.460" end="00:28:40.140" style="s2">very very mediocre but they were big</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.950" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">enough that the Home Depot&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.140" end="00:28:45.390" style="s2">loza&#39;s of the world decided not to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:47.250" style="s2">after the DC area until the very end</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.390" end="00:28:49.770" style="s2">but when they finally did you know they</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.250" end="00:28:51.900" style="s2">folded in about 18 months you know they</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.770" end="00:28:53.610" style="s2">just did not change in the face of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.900" end="00:28:55.770" style="s2">coming huge threat they had to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.610" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">coming and they just folded it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.770" end="00:28:59.580" style="s2">imagine companies that have survived</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:01.170" style="s2">over the last 20 years in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.580" end="00:29:02.370" style="s2">dynamic environment haven&#39;t got the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.170" end="00:29:05.400" style="s2">least a bit better at the change</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.370" end="00:29:07.530" style="s2">management game yeah you know I think</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">are looking at change as constant and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.980" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">the pace of it that you know as it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:19.140" style="s2">speeds up is it I feel like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:21.330" style="s2">companies have gotten closer to and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.140" end="00:29:23.370" style="s2">better about understanding their</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.940" end="00:31:09.060" style="s2">agents talk to me a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.010" end="00:31:11.500" style="s2">issues around employee engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.060" end="00:31:14.410" style="s2">what companies are doing to get better</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.500" end="00:31:16.270" style="s2">employee engagement in this world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.410" end="00:31:18.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.270" end="00:31:23.050" style="s2">employee engagement is one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.540" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">you know kind of HR ish you know topics</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.050" end="00:31:27.520" style="s2">and hot buttons out there right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:30.180" style="s2">because there&#39;s a whole world I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.520" end="00:31:32.770" style="s2">there are entire companies that just do</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.180" end="00:31:35.920" style="s2">employee engagement and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:39.340" style="s2">everything from you know what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.920" end="00:31:41.080" style="s2">our growth strategy to how do we deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.340" end="00:31:42.400" style="s2">with our culture how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.080" end="00:31:44.830" style="s2">that there&#39;s alignment within our</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.400" end="00:31:46.780" style="s2">organization between you know what we do</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.830" end="00:31:49.510" style="s2">is a company our overall strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.780" end="00:31:52.330" style="s2">our people job fit and compensation I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.510" end="00:31:54.610" style="s2">mean employee engagement is just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.330" end="00:31:57.340" style="s2">big term and it&#39;s a big effort you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.610" end="00:32:00.040" style="s2">within within organizations these days</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.340" end="00:32:03.580" style="s2">and so I think there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.040" end="00:32:05.140" style="s2">going on to you know help organizations</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.580" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">really focus on what does employee</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.140" end="00:32:09.430" style="s2">engagement mean for us what is that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:11.620" style="s2">know what is our overall strategy what</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.430" end="00:32:14.350" style="s2">makes sense given you know the business</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.620" end="00:32:16.950" style="s2">we&#39;re in the the the type of workforce</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.350" end="00:32:20.400" style="s2">that were you know that we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.950" end="00:32:23.860" style="s2">etc but from my perspective I really</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.400" end="00:32:26.770" style="s2">think about employee engagement when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.860" end="00:32:28.270" style="s2">working with clients you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.770" end="00:32:31.090" style="s2">essentially to think about you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.270" end="00:32:34.870" style="s2">of belonging growth and alignment right</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.090" end="00:32:36.430" style="s2">I mean how how do you create you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.870" end="00:32:39.280" style="s2">that connection with your employees that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.430" end="00:32:41.380" style="s2">sense of pride and belonging so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.280" end="00:32:43.420" style="s2">they feel that this is an organization</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.380" end="00:32:45.490" style="s2">that they want to be you know a part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.420" end="00:32:48.370" style="s2">and of course that reflects in how they</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.490" end="00:32:50.770" style="s2">work with customers it&#39;s how they work</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.370" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">with their colleagues internally from a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.770" end="00:32:56.170" style="s2">growth standpoint you know how our</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:58.570" style="s2">organizations committing to their</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.170" end="00:33:00.280" style="s2">employees how are they supporting their</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.570" end="00:33:03.250" style="s2">development how are they supplying</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.280" end="00:33:05.650" style="s2">growth opportunities and you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.250" end="00:33:07.300" style="s2">of how planning for that on a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.650" end="00:33:10.120" style="s2">scale than they have in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.300" end="00:33:11.260" style="s2">then and lastly alignment you know do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.120" end="00:33:13.870" style="s2">do we understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.260" end="00:33:17.170" style="s2">and you know what employees are looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.870" end="00:33:18.970" style="s2">for and can we line up our expectations</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.170" end="00:33:20.740" style="s2">both in terms of the organization you</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.970" end="00:33:23.350" style="s2">know leadership managers and our</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.740" end="00:33:24.970" style="s2">employees so that we are we&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.350" end="00:33:27.130" style="s2">the commitment that we want them to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.970" end="00:33:28.780" style="s2">you know both to our customers as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.130" end="00:33:31.180" style="s2">as to you know kind of the strategic</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.780" end="00:33:33.100" style="s2">goals of the of the organization and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.180" end="00:33:35.710" style="s2">you know I think when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.100" end="00:33:37.540" style="s2">all of those pieces and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.710" end="00:33:38.860" style="s2">there&#39;s different models you know out</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.540" end="00:33:41.050" style="s2">there in terms of you know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.860" end="00:33:43.690" style="s2">encompasses an overall employee</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.050" end="00:33:44.890" style="s2">engagement strategy but I really again</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">you know I really think about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.890" end="00:33:48.280" style="s2">that belonging that growth in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.270" end="00:33:51.430" style="s2">alignment and how that kind of creates</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.280" end="00:33:54.160" style="s2">an engagement and gets all the the major</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.430" end="00:33:56.290" style="s2">you know pillars the you know people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.160" end="00:33:59.950" style="s2">organization leadership involved and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.290" end="00:34:01.960" style="s2">driving that engagement and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.950" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">I really think organizations are paying</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.960" end="00:34:05.680" style="s2">a lot more attention to it you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">feel like there was a period in time</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.680" end="00:34:11.340" style="s2">maybe and and we still do it at some</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:13.450" style="s2">level but there was a big focus on</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.340" end="00:34:15.669" style="s2">feedback right like getting feedback</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.450" end="00:34:17.290" style="s2">from our employees what do they like</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.669" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">what are they not like you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.290" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">keep it simple let&#39;s you know blow it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:23.139" style="s2">out and start doing focus groups what do</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:24.550" style="s2">we do with all of this data oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.139" end="00:34:26.409" style="s2">we&#39;ve got employees you know that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.550" end="00:34:28.450" style="s2">unhappy and then there&#39;s you know then</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.409" end="00:34:30.280" style="s2">you you kind of get you know HR and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.450" end="00:34:32.350" style="s2">sometimes leadership into a position</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.280" end="00:34:34.690" style="s2">where they&#39;re running around frantically</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.350" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">trying to correct things from this new</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.690" end="00:34:37.770" style="s2">data that they&#39;ve that they&#39;ve collected</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:41.320" style="s2">and that I think can have its own</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.770" end="00:34:43.030" style="s2">negative consequence because surveys and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.320" end="00:34:46.570" style="s2">trying to respond to them can be I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.030" end="00:34:48.190" style="s2">really dangerous if not done well so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.570" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">think having an employee engagement</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.190" end="00:34:51.940" style="s2">strategy is really kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:54.730" style="s2">people to shift mentally about how they</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.940" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">think about how we get information and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.730" end="00:34:59.650" style="s2">share it and how we put new strategies</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:00.970" style="s2">in place to you know kind of create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.650" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">holistic approach to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.970" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">organizational machine moving but on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:10.450" style="s2">flip side of that you know these younger</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:13.840" style="s2">generations I mean the gig economy right</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.450" end="00:35:15.130" style="s2">we are the gig economy and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.840" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">of people that don&#39;t want to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.130" end="00:35:18.040" style="s2">for organizations they want to do the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:19.720" style="s2">work but they don&#39;t want to be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.040" end="00:35:21.610" style="s2">your organization and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.720" end="00:35:23.700" style="s2">figuring out ways that they can stand on</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.610" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">the periphery and just kind of 1099</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.700" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">their weigh-in and I don&#39;t know that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">can speak to how I have in my mind ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">about how that&#39;s really gonna what role</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna play in organizations you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">know down the road I&#39;ve seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">companies who are getting rid of their</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:41.310" style="s2">infrastructure right I mean how great to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:44.070" style="s2">not have to have that office building</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.310" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">what a tremendous cost but then that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.070" end="00:35:47.940" style="s2">comes with its own set of challenges</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:49.530" style="s2">so I kind of dipped into a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.940" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">different topics there but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.530" end="00:35:53.490" style="s2">answered the question overall yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">engagement areas an area I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:56.579" style="s2">interested in in fact I put a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:36:00.540" style="s2">plug in for one of my investment</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.540" end="00:36:05.250" style="s2">you know they&#39;ve got a very cool product</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.810" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">for what I would call continuous</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.250" end="00:36:10.710" style="s2">lightweight surveying they do a survey</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.180" style="s2">question every day often it&#39;s just a fun</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.710" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">question would you rather be rich or</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.180" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">famous that kind of thing but they</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">recommend that their clients put about</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:20.839" style="s2">one-third of the questions to be you</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:23.730" style="s2">know business-related and actionable and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.839" end="00:36:26.550" style="s2">the results of that thing are to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.730" end="00:36:29.910" style="s2">much better than those tedious once a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.550" end="00:36:31.829" style="s2">year 60 question questionnaires that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.910" end="00:36:33.540" style="s2">administered by some consulting firm</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.550" end="00:36:39.089" style="s2">and finally present it to management</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.079" end="00:36:43.260" style="s2">probably too late and then nothing ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.089" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">happens yep I&#39;m a much bigger than real</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.260" end="00:36:46.859" style="s2">time measurement but of course you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:48.510" style="s2">to have a management team that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.859" end="00:36:50.819" style="s2">committed to listening and actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.510" end="00:36:53.700" style="s2">doing something with it yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.819" end="00:36:57.720" style="s2">and I will tell you I I had a client</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.700" end="00:37:02.369" style="s2">once who wanted to do a survey every</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.720" end="00:37:06.260" style="s2">year and mainly because he really wanted</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.369" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">to win an award that was given out to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.260" end="00:37:12.750" style="s2">companies in the DC area every year and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:14.099" style="s2">I was coached they brought me on</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.750" end="00:37:15.960" style="s2">obviously as a consultant and I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.099" end="00:37:17.369" style="s2">coached by his leadership team that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.960" end="00:37:19.230" style="s2">had to take him downstairs to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.369" end="00:37:21.420" style="s2">restaurant and feed him a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.230" end="00:37:24.750" style="s2">martinis before I gave him the results</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.420" end="00:37:27.720" style="s2">so that you know not just listening but</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.750" end="00:37:32.520" style="s2">being okay with the fact if things</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.720" end="00:37:34.710" style="s2">aren&#39;t great absolutely and in fact when</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.520" end="00:37:36.829" style="s2">we&#39;ve been selling the voter product we</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.710" end="00:37:38.589" style="s2">have found a surprising number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.829" end="00:37:41.989" style="s2">bunnies that really are not</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.589" end="00:37:43.959" style="s2">intellectually honest they really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.989" end="00:37:46.339" style="s2">want to hear the truth</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.959" end="00:37:49.190" style="s2">absolutely that&#39;s pretty sick if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.339" end="00:37:51.079" style="s2">me as you&#39;ll recall our number one value</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.190" end="00:37:52.789" style="s2">in all rut companies is intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.079" end="00:37:55.459" style="s2">honesty you know let the chips fall</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.789" end="00:37:57.259" style="s2">where they may but perhaps even maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.459" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">more than back in the day it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.259" end="00:38:00.529" style="s2">there are people that want to live in</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">cloud cuckoo-land and don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.529" end="00:38:04.729" style="s2">truth what&#39;s that all about well and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:07.009" style="s2">think the other thing that you you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.729" end="00:38:09.799" style="s2">that you really impressed upon me was</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.009" end="00:38:11.959" style="s2">being able to speak your mind right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.799" end="00:38:14.269" style="s2">I remember and I&#39;ve got it somewhere a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.959" end="00:38:16.819" style="s2">very crisp statement from you that said</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.269" end="00:38:17.799" style="s2">and if you feel like you can&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.819" end="00:38:20.329" style="s2">work here anymore</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.799" end="00:38:22.309" style="s2">this is not a punitive organization</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.329" end="00:38:25.519" style="s2">where if you say something you know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.309" end="00:38:26.809" style="s2">you think something say it basically but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.519" end="00:38:29.209" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.809" end="00:38:32.390" style="s2">out there that don&#39;t have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.209" end="00:38:37.009" style="s2">culture and you will you you there could</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.390" end="00:38:38.239" style="s2">be punitive action taken if you you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.009" end="00:38:40.249" style="s2">and I&#39;m not talking about I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.239" end="00:38:42.799" style="s2">like at the intellectual level right not</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.249" end="00:38:45.319" style="s2">like what do you think of this guy over</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.799" end="00:38:46.969" style="s2">here I mean hey we&#39;re working on this</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.319" end="00:38:48.529" style="s2">projects it&#39;s going sideways what do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.969" end="00:38:51.140" style="s2">what do you think we need to do right no</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.529" end="00:38:52.849" style="s2">you got a you got a toe the line it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.140" end="00:38:56.959" style="s2">incredible to me how many organizations</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.849" end="00:38:59.690" style="s2">I have met that number one do that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.959" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">know and and don&#39;t try to to squelch</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.690" end="00:39:04.369" style="s2">that that piece of it and then don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:06.380" style="s2">want to hear the truth or flat-out will</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.369" end="00:39:08.239" style="s2">say I don&#39;t really think that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.380" end="00:39:10.670" style="s2">way that things are and we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.239" end="00:39:12.440" style="s2">do anything about it seems like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.670" end="00:39:14.839" style="s2">lot more of that going on I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.440" end="00:39:17.660" style="s2">the classic examples I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.839" end="00:39:21.049" style="s2">remember this was a an engineer at</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.660" end="00:39:24.979" style="s2">Google who wrote a long thoughtful and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.049" end="00:39:27.349" style="s2">controversial piece on why Google was</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.979" end="00:39:30.499" style="s2">having problems hiring women as</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.349" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">engineers yep I think his name was James</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.499" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">day more and yeah as far as I could tell</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">he was attempting to be intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:41.959" style="s2">honest you know he violated some civil</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:44.900" style="s2">lists of HR politeness but he hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.959" end="00:39:47.500" style="s2">getting fired for that for floating a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.900" end="00:39:49.360" style="s2">document on an internal discussion board</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.500" end="00:39:52.030" style="s2">that was meant for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.360" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">discussion of ideas including you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.030" end="00:39:57.220" style="s2">fringe ideas and this thing violated</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:39:59.950" style="s2">some level of political correctness</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.220" end="00:40:01.600" style="s2">sufficiently badly that they fired him</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.950" end="00:40:04.420" style="s2">now what kind of signal does that send</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.600" end="00:40:06.730" style="s2">to your organization it sends that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.420" end="00:40:08.740" style="s2">need to shut the fuck up signal exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.730" end="00:40:11.170" style="s2">and of course part of that is being</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.740" end="00:40:14.110" style="s2">driven by you know today&#39;s HR</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.170" end="00:40:16.270" style="s2">departments I must tell you when I talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.110" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">to friends who are still working in big</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.270" end="00:40:20.920" style="s2">corporate America they all go on</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:22.990" style="s2">endlessly about how much HR sucks I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.920" end="00:40:24.820" style="s2">what we used to think that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.990" end="00:40:27.220" style="s2">done well it was kind of a waste of time</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.820" end="00:40:30.610" style="s2">but now I hear a lot more about it being</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:32.770" style="s2">a positive evil yeah any any of any of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.610" end="00:40:34.630" style="s2">that in your experience well you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.770" end="00:40:38.590" style="s2">it&#39;s funny I mean even though I started</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.630" end="00:40:43.500" style="s2">off my career in HR from the consulting</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.590" end="00:40:46.450" style="s2">perspective I have never gone in to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.500" end="00:40:48.490" style="s2">client effort working with human</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.450" end="00:40:51.580" style="s2">resources they might become a part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.490" end="00:40:54.670" style="s2">the process once I&#39;m in but I somehow</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.580" end="00:40:57.550" style="s2">kind of became an antichrist of HR in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.670" end="00:41:00.310" style="s2">lot of ways and I think that in and of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.550" end="00:41:01.990" style="s2">itself kind of says quite a bit about HR</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.310" end="00:41:03.970" style="s2">like you don&#39;t need any improvement</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.990" end="00:41:06.190" style="s2">especially giving the work I do right</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.970" end="00:41:08.620" style="s2">leadership developments culture change</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.190" end="00:41:10.660" style="s2">you know you would think that HR would</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.620" end="00:41:14.050" style="s2">be my caveat into the work that I do but</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.660" end="00:41:17.350" style="s2">but it very rarely is that said I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.050" end="00:41:19.030" style="s2">feel like there is just I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.350" end="00:41:23.110" style="s2">mean maybe there will always just be</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.030" end="00:41:24.850" style="s2">some aspect of HR that is a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.110" end="00:41:27.910" style="s2">evil quote unquote like you said in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.850" end="00:41:30.850" style="s2">terms of they you know do recruiting</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.910" end="00:41:33.370" style="s2">they do employee paperwork they do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.850" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">know but I still don&#39;t feel that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.370" end="00:41:38.320" style="s2">across-the-board HR has done enough to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:41.080" style="s2">really try to understand and evolve in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.320" end="00:41:42.730" style="s2">way that&#39;s like hey people are the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.080" end="00:41:45.430" style="s2">important part of an organization like</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.730" end="00:41:49.000" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly in your wheelhouse can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.430" end="00:41:50.590" style="s2">you do something more revolutionary than</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.000" end="00:41:52.420" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing now and it and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.590" end="00:41:54.070" style="s2">feels like again clients that I work</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.420" end="00:41:55.930" style="s2">with they just want to work around HR</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.070" end="00:41:57.070" style="s2">because HR has never given them anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.930" end="00:41:58.630" style="s2">to really</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.070" end="00:41:59.950" style="s2">you know drive any part of the business</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.630" end="00:42:01.720" style="s2">drive any part of shopping that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.950" end="00:42:04.270" style="s2">probably not fair across the board but</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.720" end="00:42:07.630" style="s2">they I don&#39;t know just it just feels</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.270" end="00:42:09.400" style="s2">stuffy and it feels old-school yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.630" end="00:42:11.620" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of complaints that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.400" end="00:42:12.760" style="s2">hearing from people out in the field and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.620" end="00:42:14.980" style="s2">I remember we know we built our</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.760" end="00:42:17.260" style="s2">organization our HR organization at</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.980" end="00:42:19.330" style="s2">Thompson so that it was central to our</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.260" end="00:42:21.310" style="s2">strategy you know I people ask me how I</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.330" end="00:42:23.050" style="s2">spent my time I said I spent a third of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.310" end="00:42:24.700" style="s2">my time on making sure our HR</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.050" end="00:42:26.920" style="s2">organization was the best that we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.700" end="00:42:30.040" style="s2">possibly have out there and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.920" end="00:42:33.160" style="s2">may recall we divided it up into three</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.040" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">parts basically recruiting retention and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.160" end="00:42:37.150" style="s2">development and then the third part for</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:39.370" style="s2">the transactional management of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.150" end="00:42:41.500" style="s2">insurance programs that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.370" end="00:42:43.210" style="s2">and I thought that was that produced a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.500" end="00:42:45.130" style="s2">pretty damn good result for us and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.210" end="00:42:47.470" style="s2">know some of our alums have taken those</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.130" end="00:42:49.510" style="s2">ideas with them and I think it worked</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.470" end="00:42:50.980" style="s2">out well for them but what you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.510" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">what my friends are seeing is that in</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.980" end="00:42:57.700" style="s2">general at best HR is a nuisance and at</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:59.380" style="s2">worst it can be a big obstacle yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.700" end="00:43:01.660" style="s2">you know you were talking about the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.380" end="00:43:03.580" style="s2">guy from Google right well you know did</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.660" end="00:43:05.290" style="s2">you I don&#39;t know I mean I&#39;m sure you did</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.580" end="00:43:06.970" style="s2">it some level paid attention to you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.290" end="00:43:09.640" style="s2">kind of everything that happened at uber</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.970" end="00:43:12.280" style="s2">right and as I was reading along as</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.640" end="00:43:15.190" style="s2">different things unfolded at uber what</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.280" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">amazed me was the role that I mean HR</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.190" end="00:43:21.250" style="s2">was culpable in that situation right of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:23.710" style="s2">you know women filing complaints about</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.250" end="00:43:27.940" style="s2">things that were happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:30.220" style="s2">workplace and you know soft-pedaling I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.940" end="00:43:33.670" style="s2">mean just not jumping in and doing their</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.220" end="00:43:35.590" style="s2">job and I was really blown away and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.670" end="00:43:37.300" style="s2">was even more blown away when they fired</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.590" end="00:43:39.670" style="s2">the CEO and I&#39;m like you need to walk</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.300" end="00:43:41.800" style="s2">the head of HR out because that person</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.670" end="00:43:43.510" style="s2">did a grave injustice to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.800" end="00:43:45.640" style="s2">organization and to the employees that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.510" end="00:43:48.130" style="s2">were saying hey we&#39;ve got some sexual</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.640" end="00:43:49.600" style="s2">harassment issues here I was really</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.130" end="00:43:52.750" style="s2">surprised and I really felt like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.600" end="00:43:55.960" style="s2">was an opportunity to kind of shake up</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.750" end="00:43:59.320" style="s2">HR the concept of HR the role of HR but</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.960" end="00:44:01.480" style="s2">I also feel like they&#39;re so in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.320" end="00:44:03.850" style="s2">pockets of other executives in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.480" end="00:44:05.740" style="s2">company that in a lot of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.850" end="00:44:08.330" style="s2">they&#39;re probably toeing the line right</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.740" end="00:44:10.580" style="s2">instead of really able to say hey this</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.330" end="00:44:12.200" style="s2">not okay this is not what we&#39;re doing we</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.580" end="00:44:13.580" style="s2">are not gonna soft-pedal this we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.200" end="00:44:16.490" style="s2">gonna bury this we&#39;re gonna deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.580" end="00:44:19.310" style="s2">immediately so they kind of get a bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.490" end="00:44:20.570" style="s2">rap from all angles I mean and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.310" end="00:44:23.270" style="s2">there are those organizations out there</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.570" end="00:44:25.430" style="s2">that are much more I think futuristic</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.270" end="00:44:28.130" style="s2">but I feel like they&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.430" end="00:44:31.010" style="s2">coverage up above them that gives them</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.130" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">the freedom and the flexibility to be to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.010" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">be different right and not all leaders</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">want to deal with HR problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:41.540" style="s2">yeah well this goes back to you know my</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:44.690" style="s2">prime directive intellectual honesty at</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.540" end="00:44:46.700" style="s2">all levels at all times and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.690" end="00:44:49.070" style="s2">amazing why would you want anything else</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.700" end="00:44:50.840" style="s2">but the truth because if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.070" end="00:44:52.430" style="s2">to make decisions you&#39;re always in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.840" end="00:44:54.440" style="s2">business trying to make decisions on</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.430" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">limited information and if the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.440" end="00:44:58.010" style="s2">information you have isn&#39;t the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.750" style="s2">available and isn&#39;t the truth so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.010" end="00:45:02.360" style="s2">best your people and your organization</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.750" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">knows it you inevitably will make worse</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.360" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">decisions so it strikes me that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:10.730" style="s2">uber kind of cover-up is yet another</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:13.580" style="s2">example of people failing to live to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.730" end="00:45:15.560" style="s2">code of intellectual honesty yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.580" end="00:45:17.570" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s just you know also at</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.560" end="00:45:19.610" style="s2">some level just good common sense you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.570" end="00:45:21.740" style="s2">know I mean if you&#39;ve got an individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.610" end="00:45:23.570" style="s2">let alone a number of individuals who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.740" end="00:45:25.640" style="s2">come forward to say we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.570" end="00:45:28.490" style="s2">problem because this person over here</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.640" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">you know has has done something to me I</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.490" end="00:45:33.860" style="s2">mean you&#39;ve got responsibility number</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:35.690" style="s2">one to to take action right I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.860" end="00:45:37.880" style="s2">not necessarily in that moment make a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.690" end="00:45:40.190" style="s2">decision but it&#39;s there&#39;s some type of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.880" end="00:45:42.740" style="s2">action that needs to come from that to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.190" end="00:45:44.690" style="s2">get to the truth about you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.740" end="00:45:46.670" style="s2">happening but you know where&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.690" end="00:45:48.110" style="s2">where&#39;s your moral compass and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.670" end="00:45:50.990" style="s2">in all of this I mean you don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.110" end="00:45:52.340" style="s2">things like that just fester and and go</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.990" end="00:45:53.870" style="s2">away or get to the point where now</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.340" end="00:45:55.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you know people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.870" end="00:45:57.560" style="s2">leaving their jobs because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.400" end="00:46:00.370" style="s2">doing your job and taking care of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.560" end="00:46:02.780" style="s2">situation you know at some level so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.370" end="00:46:05.510" style="s2">would hope that it&#39;s a in large part you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.780" end="00:46:07.550" style="s2">know speaks to the type of people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.510" end="00:46:09.170" style="s2">the type of leadership that&#39;s within the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.550" end="00:46:11.150" style="s2">company right and like I said I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.170" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">they walk the CEO out they should have</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.150" end="00:46:12.890" style="s2">walked the head of HR on at the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:16.460" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.890" end="00:46:18.050" style="s2">my mind yep absolutely let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.460" end="00:46:19.340" style="s2">another topic that&#39;s you know related</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.050" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">the things we were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.340" end="00:46:23.780" style="s2">which is one of the things I think is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:27.980" style="s2">actually been a good movement in general</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.780" end="00:46:30.140" style="s2">in our workplaces but there&#39;s been some</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.980" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">issues and there&#39;s some ways to go which</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.140" end="00:46:34.280" style="s2">is the issues around women and men in</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:36.530" style="s2">the workplace right yeah one of my</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.280" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">favorites yeah a lot more women in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.530" end="00:46:41.360" style="s2">senior positions though not yet pro rata</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:42.890" style="s2">so if you look up the pipeline a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.360" end="00:46:46.250" style="s2">ways it&#39;s quite interesting to see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.890" end="00:46:49.490" style="s2">the percentages of men and women in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.250" end="00:46:53.090" style="s2">elite MBA programs in law school medical</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.490" end="00:46:56.270" style="s2">school almost exactly 50/50 in four-year</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.090" end="00:46:59.000" style="s2">colleges it&#39;s more like 58 59 % women so</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.270" end="00:47:01.730" style="s2">the pipeline should be driving a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.000" end="00:47:04.190" style="s2">continued closing of these gaps but they</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.730" end="00:47:06.920" style="s2">still exist love to hear your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.190" end="00:47:09.080" style="s2">on I&#39;m not sure what the right word is</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:11.330" style="s2">gender dynamics in the workforce I guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.080" end="00:47:13.220" style="s2">I mean a lot has happened there for</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.330" end="00:47:16.250" style="s2">instance since you know since we worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.220" end="00:47:18.110" style="s2">together and you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.250" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">that is really that has really stuck</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.110" end="00:47:22.190" style="s2">with me is that what we want to see and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">we still as you mentioned have a ways to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.190" end="00:47:27.410" style="s2">go I mean just across the board and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:29.720" style="s2">women in leadership positions women in</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.410" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">leadership positions in Fortune 500</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.720" end="00:47:34.520" style="s2">companies women on boards you know just</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:38.150" style="s2">the presence of women in organizations I</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.520" end="00:47:39.830" style="s2">think some aspect of dare I say you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.150" end="00:47:42.170" style="s2">kind of now we&#39;ve got the me2 movement</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.830" end="00:47:45.740" style="s2">right so that has put a whole other I</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.170" end="00:47:48.560" style="s2">think layer of complexity around men and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.740" end="00:47:51.980" style="s2">women in the in the workplace and have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.560" end="00:47:53.120" style="s2">good friend who you know we enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.980" end="00:47:55.190" style="s2">fact that we don&#39;t see eye to eye on</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.120" end="00:47:57.140" style="s2">everything because we can really rudl</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.190" end="00:47:58.790" style="s2">around topics and we were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.140" end="00:48:00.650" style="s2">talking about lean in and she&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.790" end="00:48:03.590" style="s2">man we got to lean out and we&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.650" end="00:48:05.270" style="s2">know everybody just needs to women need</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.590" end="00:48:08.570" style="s2">to do what they&#39;ve got to do and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.270" end="00:48:10.310" style="s2">got to encourage men to want to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.570" end="00:48:11.750" style="s2">better relationships with women in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.310" end="00:48:14.360" style="s2">workplace as women want to have better</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.750" end="00:48:15.560" style="s2">relationships with men and so I have not</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.360" end="00:48:17.330" style="s2">and I mentioned this to you I&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.560" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">been in a position where I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.330" end="00:48:21.820" style="s2">personally the relationships I&#39;ve had</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.510" end="00:48:46.650" style="s2">that there&#39;s probably a tension that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.859" end="00:49:27.990" style="s2">fascinating and that needs to drive a</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.560" end="00:49:45.329" style="s2">executive ranks but now it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.599" end="00:49:47.010" style="s2">backlash around this me too thing you</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">woman only company I mean to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.420" end="00:50:04.020" style="s2">that&#39;s every bit as bad as a men only</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">company yeah yeah let&#39;s hope we can get</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.020" end="00:50:07.619" style="s2">past these challenges I mean overall I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.540" style="s2">mean I got to tell you the me2 thing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.619" end="00:50:12.060" style="s2">real I mean I know number of women have</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.540" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">horrifying stories from the workplace</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.060" end="00:50:17.910" style="s2">and I&#39;ve known some perpetrators on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:20.099" style="s2">male side in fact you probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.910" end="00:50:22.560" style="s2">even know this at tier we had one who</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.099" end="00:50:24.599" style="s2">sexually harassed one of the women in</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.560" end="00:50:26.579" style="s2">the most gross and crude possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.599" end="00:50:29.010" style="s2">fashion and you know being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.579" end="00:50:31.410" style="s2">old-school rather than dealing with HR I</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.010" end="00:50:33.089" style="s2">called him up I said when Dad was office</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.410" end="00:50:35.010" style="s2">it said if you ever tried such a thing</p>

<p begin="00:50:35.010" end="00:50:41.069" style="s2">right two weeks later he resigned</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.210" end="00:50:43.109" style="s2">now that was probably not a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.069" end="00:50:45.930" style="s2">impolitic li incorrect but it worked but</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.109" end="00:50:48.450" style="s2">you know those foul people are been out</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.930" end="00:50:51.869" style="s2">there but we can&#39;t let the you know a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.450" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">tiny percentage of foul people ruin</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.869" end="00:50:55.770" style="s2">gender equality in the workplace and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:58.260" style="s2">know there&#39;s some signs that it might</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.770" end="00:51:01.109" style="s2">yeah and and you can&#39;t let it ruin the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.260" end="00:51:03.150" style="s2">power that comes from you know just</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.109" end="00:51:05.670" style="s2">hiring great people whether they&#39;re men</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.150" end="00:51:08.190" style="s2">or women and and and creating you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.670" end="00:51:10.619" style="s2">teams that have different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.190" end="00:51:12.869" style="s2">and have different experiences and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.619" end="00:51:14.760" style="s2">can create really amazing outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.869" end="00:51:17.190" style="s2">within organizations right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.760" end="00:51:19.530" style="s2">want to pass that up either and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.190" end="00:51:20.670" style="s2">know I mean I I definitely you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.530" end="00:51:23.390" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely been an</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.390" end="00:51:29.250" style="s2">you know it hasn&#39;t been so grotesque</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.579" end="00:51:31.970" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t been able to you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.250" end="00:51:34.829" style="s2">kind of fight back and at some level get</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.970" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">kind of get closure around things but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.829" end="00:51:40.410" style="s2">also you know I I think everybody needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:43.980" style="s2">to be more mindful of our behavior right</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.410" end="00:51:46.619" style="s2">then like let&#39;s hearken back to your</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.980" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">interview style at Thompson right where</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.619" end="00:51:50.280" style="s2">you always made a point to say fuck in</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:51.210" style="s2">an interview so that people understood</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.280" end="00:51:54.030" style="s2">kind of what they were getting</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.210" end="00:51:56.339" style="s2">themselves into well you think that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.030" end="00:51:58.140" style="s2">would be okay in this day and age would</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.339" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">you still do that it was it my company I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.140" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">sure shit what right if I work for a big</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">corporation my guess is they they</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:06.839" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t like it like I have to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:09.450" style="s2">a funny story here&#39;s what my favorite HR</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.839" end="00:52:13.250" style="s2">stories when I the first day I went to</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.250" end="00:52:17.670" style="s2">brought by top thirty people together</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.569" end="00:52:19.170" style="s2">which here&#39;s an interesting bad sign</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.670" end="00:52:21.420" style="s2">those top thirty people never even</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.170" end="00:52:23.160" style="s2">brought together before which by itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.420" end="00:52:26.369" style="s2">was a sign of how screwed up that place</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.160" end="00:52:28.380" style="s2">was I gave him a 45-minute pep talk and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.369" end="00:52:30.059" style="s2">you know vision of what I had in mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.380" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">for the company and you know what needed</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.059" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">to be fixed and where we were going but</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:35.910" style="s2">what tremendous opportunity we all had</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:38.250" style="s2">together here and I used the word fuck</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.910" end="00:52:40.290" style="s2">three times quite humorously</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.250" end="00:52:41.170" style="s2">the next day I get a call from the head</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.290" end="00:52:43.150" style="s2">of</p>
