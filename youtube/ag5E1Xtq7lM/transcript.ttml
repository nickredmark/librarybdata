<p begin="00:00:00.730" end="00:00:06.410" style="s2">so let&#39;s get so I&#39;m going to now move</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.080" end="00:00:08.149" style="s2">into the more serious talk so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.410" end="00:00:09.679" style="s2">this is of course the picture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.149" end="00:00:11.960" style="s2">pretty famous to the Tower of Babel and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.679" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">the idea of the Tower of Babel was of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.960" end="00:00:14.719" style="s2">course that we were trying to build this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:17.539" style="s2">massive structure to get up to the sky</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.719" end="00:00:19.609" style="s2">to meet with God but we couldn&#39;t get our</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.539" end="00:00:21.080" style="s2">act together down on earth and it would</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.609" end="00:00:23.119" style="s2">God actually shattered this and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.080" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">fragmented the languages and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.119" end="00:00:27.170" style="s2">we have miscommunication but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:30.230" style="s2">measurement story and if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.170" end="00:00:31.760" style="s2">story there&#39;s a lot of debate about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.230" end="00:00:33.590" style="s2">do we measure and how do we build this</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.760" end="00:00:36.620" style="s2">damn thing and this is the situation</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.590" end="00:00:38.090" style="s2">we&#39;re in multiple fronts where</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.620" end="00:00:40.730" style="s2">measurement is not interfacing with</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.090" end="00:00:43.010" style="s2">reality anymore multiple fronts where a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.730" end="00:00:46.340" style="s2">false sense of reality is being created</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:50.170" style="s2">and where power is overriding the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.340" end="00:00:53.480" style="s2">interest of the good so it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.170" end="00:00:55.699" style="s2">mutually amplifying crisis and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.480" end="00:00:57.890" style="s2">crisis in the technical will barian</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.699" end="00:00:59.300" style="s2">Harbor masse and kind of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.890" end="00:01:02.300" style="s2">structural sense of the word which is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.300" end="00:01:04.600" style="s2">say it&#39;s a crisis that demands either</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.300" end="00:01:07.700" style="s2">vertical structural reorganization or</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.600" end="00:01:09.320" style="s2">regression because it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.700" end="00:01:10.729" style="s2">that we can&#39;t stay in this that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.320" end="00:01:12.650" style="s2">argument that this is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.729" end="00:01:14.420" style="s2">turning points catastrophic bifurcation</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.650" end="00:01:16.220" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a crisis like ah this really</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.420" end="00:01:18.140" style="s2">sucks it&#39;s a crisis in a structural</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.220" end="00:01:19.970" style="s2">sense and it&#39;s the structures of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.140" end="00:01:21.290" style="s2">measurement that need to change so if</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.970" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a post-capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.290" end="00:01:24.770" style="s2">economy if we&#39;re talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">actually sustainable form of human</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.770" end="00:01:27.830" style="s2">civilization we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.750" style="s2">fundamentally different measurement</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.830" end="00:01:32.270" style="s2">infrastructure at the basis of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.750" end="00:01:34.369" style="s2">the claim so I&#39;m going to run through</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.270" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">these crisises economics first so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.369" end="00:01:38.360" style="s2">is a Berk share this is actually a form</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:39.500" style="s2">of alternative currency that circulates</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.360" end="00:01:41.420" style="s2">in the berkshires if you live in like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.500" end="00:01:43.700" style="s2">Great Barrington you can live most of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.420" end="00:01:44.810" style="s2">your life just circulating with these</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.700" end="00:01:46.490" style="s2">forms of currency so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.810" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">interesting that it&#39;s not a great model</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.490" end="00:01:50.659" style="s2">it&#39;s owned by for-profit company it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:51.829" style="s2">kind of cute you have to pay your taxes</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.659" end="00:01:54.920" style="s2">of course in American dollars</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.829" end="00:01:57.049" style="s2">but the idea that money is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.920" end="00:01:59.140" style="s2">form of measurement it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.049" end="00:02:01.610" style="s2">and one of the things that money does is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.140" end="00:02:04.759" style="s2">homogenized the measurement of value</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.610" end="00:02:06.469" style="s2">right the neoliberal consensus that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.759" end="00:02:08.410" style="s2">have has essentially said that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.469" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">one way to measure value in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.410" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">right and it is money</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m not going to get into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:17.850" style="s2">Marxist theories of you know how that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:20.490" style="s2">distorts and alienates us but you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.850" end="00:02:22.260" style="s2">see and we&#39;ve all experienced it when</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.490" end="00:02:24.570" style="s2">you take certain things for example like</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">child care and put a price on them it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.570" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">becomes a different kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">because you&#39;ve quantified something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:32.880" style="s2">is typically understood to be not</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">quantifiable and we&#39;re increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.880" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">invading the life world by turning it</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">into things that can have a price tag</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:43.830" style="s2">right like the tragedy of capitalism in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">one way is the idea that we have to put</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">a price on things that are priceless all</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:51.450" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a measurement issue and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">then of course there&#39;s just econometrics</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:59.820" style="s2">which is like to my mind like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:03:01.380" style="s2">most ridiculous Sciences so GDP is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.820" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">classic thing you&#39;d see here and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.380" end="00:03:05.489" style="s2">you&#39;d see if you have this figure on GDP</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">is fluctuation but generally a rising</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.489" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">gross domestic product globally this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.330" style="s2">called the Gini coefficient the Gini</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:16.860" style="s2">coefficient is just as simple to produce</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.330" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2">as GDP in a way but it tracks economic</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.860" end="00:03:22.790" style="s2">inequality it tracks within country</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.980" end="00:03:25.380" style="s2">economic inequality so what this says is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.790" end="00:03:28.769" style="s2">economic inequality has been going up</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.380" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">drastically since the 80s right but so</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.769" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">has GDP now which one do we value and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">which one do we use in debates about</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.340" style="s2">policy and which ones do we use to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:42.299" style="s2">about the health of national economies</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:44.940" style="s2">GDP which oversimplifies and neglects</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.299" end="00:03:47.670" style="s2">within country variability it&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.940" end="00:03:49.080" style="s2">issue right and then there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.670" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2">these things in economics that have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.080" end="00:03:55.110" style="s2">do with the valuation and measurement of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">risk right the main reason we had in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.110" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">2007 an economic crisis was because</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">there&#39;s Finance ears were creating these</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">collateralized debt obligations and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">there were these rating agencies that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">said those are dope investments like</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:10.079" style="s2">they had a four point scale of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:11.880" style="s2">measurement of risk on investment in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.079" end="00:04:14.190" style="s2">there like this is higher yield they</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">were colluding with the finance seers to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.190" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">basically extract wealth from extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">vulnerable populations and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:23.789" style="s2">whole thing came crashing down but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">was about power colluding with measure</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.789" end="00:04:27.590" style="s2">to distort</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:30.389" style="s2">and to create a different and unjust</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.590" end="00:04:31.920" style="s2">situation education this is my field</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.389" end="00:04:33.389" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a book coming out about</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.920" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">educational measurement and social</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.389" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">justice this is a picture of a testing</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.980" style="s2">boycott in Seattle in 2013 and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">people are walking out and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.980" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2">not doing it anymore to me this is one</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">of the most exciting things I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:48.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m in touch with these people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:50.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a real growing movement to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.510" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">that the problem in educational reform</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.970" end="00:04:53.910" style="s2">what&#39;s backing the marketization of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">privatization of education what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.910" end="00:04:58.440" style="s2">backing the increasing use of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:04:59.760" style="s2">tropics among school-age kids it mostly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.440" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">can be brought down to the testing</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">infrastructure and a lot of that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:05.640" style="s2">brought down to what I just described</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.950" style="s2">they need to put a price on what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.640" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">priceless right and the need to quantify</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.950" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">what has traditionally been</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:13.200" style="s2">unquantifiable the need to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">something that we used to have for free</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.200" end="00:05:18.030" style="s2">away from us and sell it back to us</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">right and this is what harbor mas talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.030" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">about as the invasion of the life world</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:23.550" style="s2">by the system and one of the ways you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.229" style="s2">that is by measuring measuring measuring</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">more of what used to not be measured</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.229" end="00:05:28.139" style="s2">that we just not even think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:30.470" style="s2">measuring and now we measure everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.139" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">that moves in education as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.470" end="00:05:37.050" style="s2">environment right I mean environmental</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:40.260" style="s2">measures are extremely contentious</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.050" end="00:05:41.910" style="s2">political topic right and so this is one</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.260" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">of these maps that shows a distribution</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.910" end="00:05:46.710" style="s2">of temperature change around the world</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:06:00.870" style="s2">most people accept at face value right</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.380" end="00:06:02.970" style="s2">there are huge regions where no measures</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.870" end="00:06:04.500" style="s2">are taken at all and you know in a</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.830" end="00:06:11.970" style="s2">saying that we don&#39;t actually know the</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.970" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">with because we have simple ways of</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:22.169" style="s2">phenomenon this is and this relates to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:25.080" style="s2">the climate crisis this is a water meter</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.169" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">that you can put on your faucet and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.080" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">will tell you how much water you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:30.810" style="s2">using in a day right and that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:32.700" style="s2">a great idea and I agree that it is but</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.810" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">as the economic crisis deepens what</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.700" end="00:06:36.889" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see is increasing policy</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:39.590" style="s2">and increasing use of force</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.889" end="00:06:43.159" style="s2">to bring measurement into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.590" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">distribution of scarce resources and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.159" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">I see a future where as the economic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:50.810" style="s2">ecological crisis gets more complex our</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:53.870" style="s2">lives get constrained in extremely</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.870" end="00:06:57.319" style="s2">happen through measurement you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.639" end="00:07:00.169" style="s2">people are you know think about your</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.319" end="00:07:03.529" style="s2">electric meter you know so and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.169" end="00:07:04.819" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna measure your water yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.529" end="00:07:07.310" style="s2">your water bill I mean they measure your</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.819" end="00:07:09.289" style="s2">water but this is precise you know so uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.310" end="00:07:11.419" style="s2">okay politics in another area where</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.289" end="00:07:15.110" style="s2">measurement is a mess this is a poll</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.419" end="00:07:17.060" style="s2">about political polls right that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.110" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">it&#39;s gotten like and it&#39;s about what</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.060" end="00:07:20.719" style="s2">polls do we trust and there&#39;s and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.580" style="s2">not going to get into the details here</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.719" end="00:07:25.939" style="s2">but my point is that political polling</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.580" end="00:07:27.979" style="s2">is an incredibly crude way to get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.939" end="00:07:29.990" style="s2">sense of the nature of what the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.979" end="00:07:32.419" style="s2">are thinking it&#39;s the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.990" end="00:07:33.770" style="s2">participatory democracy it&#39;s a forced</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.419" end="00:07:35.270" style="s2">choice equation where they give you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.770" end="00:07:36.289" style="s2">several options and you&#39;re forced to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.270" end="00:07:38.509" style="s2">pick one of them it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.289" end="00:07:41.509" style="s2">standardized test right and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.509" end="00:07:44.060" style="s2">an insight into the people this is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.509" end="00:07:45.349" style="s2">electronic voting booth right the voting</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.060" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">is one of the most basic forms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.349" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">measurement and created in the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.599" style="s2">world they had all these systems from</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:52.610" style="s2">the volume of applause to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.599" end="00:07:54.289" style="s2">leaves a marble and a different bucket</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.610" end="00:07:56.029" style="s2">as they leave the auditorium all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.289" end="00:07:59.149" style="s2">they&#39;re ways to try to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.029" end="00:08:04.509" style="s2">how do we measure the mood of the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.149" end="00:08:08.569" style="s2">and participatory democracy is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.509" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">where you vote go/no-go is a very other</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.569" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">thing and I think we underestimate the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:14.930" style="s2">way that our political debates are</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:16.669" style="s2">polarized simply as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.930" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">basic technology that we use to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.669" end="00:08:20.149" style="s2">democratic decisions which is again a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:22.779" style="s2">forced choice and standardized testing</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.149" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">called selected-response right</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.779" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">deliberative democracy is constructive</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">response they&#39;re not going to get it as</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:31.310" style="s2">a distinction but it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:33.289" style="s2">think about a future where we do forms</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:35.180" style="s2">of this political decision-making that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.289" end="00:08:37.940" style="s2">nothing to do with voting in any simple</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.180" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">way right now we have a form of politics</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.940" end="00:08:44.390" style="s2">which is spectatorship and voting and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">models precisely advertising and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.390" end="00:08:50.450" style="s2">consuming and it&#39;s a very tight</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">relationship I mean the Super Bowl and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.450" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">you know presidential campaign are sell</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.760" end="00:08:58.700" style="s2">a lot of commercials so health right</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.690" end="00:09:00.440" style="s2">this is the DSM everyone knows the DSM</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.700" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">it&#39;s been a little bit too funked but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.440" end="00:09:05.270" style="s2">put it on here just as and just to kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">of put into the space there&#39;s this huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.270" end="00:09:09.740" style="s2">and proliferating area of medical</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:13.190" style="s2">diagnostics and medical diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.740" end="00:09:15.070" style="s2">technology and I&#39;m not gonna say this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.190" end="00:09:17.030" style="s2">good or bad that that&#39;s proliferating</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.070" end="00:09:18.860" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna say that we have created</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.030" end="00:09:20.330" style="s2">an incredibly complex medical</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.860" end="00:09:24.380" style="s2">bureaucracy based fundamentally on</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.330" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">measures and we have a reductive sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.380" end="00:09:29.300" style="s2">of the nature of disease so we have kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">of isolated forms of medical measurement</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.300" end="00:09:33.590" style="s2">that really distort the full complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:35.330" style="s2">of the human so that&#39;s one aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.590" end="00:09:38.510" style="s2">medical measurement and then this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.330" end="00:09:40.850" style="s2">Human Genome Project medical diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.510" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">are actually about 10 to 15 years behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.850" end="00:09:43.820" style="s2">where they could be if we were using</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:45.620" style="s2">everything we knew about customized</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.820" end="00:09:49.010" style="s2">medicine and genetics the main reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.620" end="00:09:50.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the case I think is because we</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.010" end="00:09:53.000" style="s2">have a for-profit health care industry</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.450" end="00:09:55.460" style="s2">in the United States and you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.000" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">gonna have a health care industry that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.460" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">actually cures people and is for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:01.610" style="s2">all right as simple as soon as you cure</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">someone they don&#39;t come back to give you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.610" end="00:10:05.270" style="s2">more money if you want to make money in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:08.510" style="s2">medicine you need to create chronic</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.270" end="00:10:09.710" style="s2">dependence on disease right or drugs</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.510" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">that create side effects that you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.710" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">treat without the drugs which is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">happens so personality I love this thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.170" end="00:10:18.700" style="s2">so this is the standardized service</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:21.320" style="s2">worker and this is a White Castle</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.700" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">corporation thing for 1931 what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.320" end="00:10:23.750" style="s2">interesting about this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">there&#39;s all the physical things you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.750" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">to do but here there&#39;s an arrow pointing</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:31.640" style="s2">at his brain that says be ready to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:33.230" style="s2">a suggestion so they&#39;re not even telling</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.640" end="00:10:35.240" style="s2">you to just standardize the way you look</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.230" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;re telling you to standardize your</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.240" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">mental state as a worker and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">the main organizations that I&#39;ve got my</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:43.940" style="s2">eye on is the international standards</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:47.180" style="s2">organization which probably no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.940" end="00:10:49.730" style="s2">ever heard of so ISO 9000 they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.180" end="00:10:52.310" style="s2">never heard of ISO 9000 yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:55.910" style="s2">so I have so 9,000 effects millions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.310" end="00:10:57.890" style="s2">millions of people and none of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.910" end="00:11:00.440" style="s2">people had to say in the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.890" end="00:11:01.890" style="s2">this ISO 9000 essentially a massive</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.440" end="00:11:04.130" style="s2">human resource</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.890" end="00:11:06.600" style="s2">kind of management system so any huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.130" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">multinational has to follow the policies</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.600" end="00:11:11.160" style="s2">of ISO 9000 and the people affected by</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:13.110" style="s2">those policies have no idea and were</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.160" end="00:11:14.100" style="s2">never consulted and if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.110" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">way it was created in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.100" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">international standards organization it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.579" style="s2">is built essentially as a way to control</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:26.130" style="s2">labor and it was put in place again with</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.579" end="00:11:28.019" style="s2">in the 70s so so that&#39;s the scary stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.130" end="00:11:29.610" style="s2">and that was very quickly and you read</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.019" end="00:11:31.079" style="s2">my paper you can get more and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.610" end="00:11:33.390" style="s2">expand it into a book cuz I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.079" end="00:11:34.829" style="s2">it&#39;s a critical issue but you can see</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.390" end="00:11:37.500" style="s2">that there&#39;s this complex compounding</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.829" end="00:11:39.390" style="s2">crisis and it relates epistemology with</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.500" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">ontology and ethics and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.390" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">things together but it&#39;s grounding out</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:45.420" style="s2">of the fact that if we created different</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.430" style="s2">measures we would have a very different</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.430" end="00:11:51.510" style="s2">been decided on at some prior point in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.019" end="00:11:54.019" style="s2">history the trajectory of where it would</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.510" end="00:11:56.670" style="s2">be different so I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.019" end="00:12:00.450" style="s2">like kind of preferable futures for</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.670" end="00:12:02.130" style="s2">measurement so I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.450" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">actually reconsider the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.130" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">anthropocentric measurement systems you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:08.070" style="s2">know one of the things we lost with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.019" style="s2">metric system was a system that made any</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.070" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">references to the dimensionality of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.019" end="00:12:13.949" style="s2">human form and so that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">massive impersonal forms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.949" end="00:12:17.720" style="s2">infrastructure and alienating</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">standardized McMansions</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.720" end="00:12:21.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s been a couple architects</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:24.120" style="s2">who&#39;ve pushed back about against this</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.000" end="00:12:25.740" style="s2">and refused to use standard forms and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.120" end="00:12:26.790" style="s2">create their own anthropocentric forms</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.740" end="00:12:28.680" style="s2">and you get much more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.790" end="00:12:30.630" style="s2">buildings so I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:33.029" style="s2">understand the value of the universal</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.630" end="00:12:34.740" style="s2">measure but also think about the local</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.029" end="00:12:36.899" style="s2">the particular and the human scale so</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.740" end="00:12:38.550" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing I&#39;m going to talk more</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.899" end="00:12:41.690" style="s2">about this valorisation of the unique</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.550" end="00:12:44.040" style="s2">and how important it is on a later slide</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.690" end="00:12:46.350" style="s2">so the dynamics distance and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.040" end="00:12:48.449" style="s2">is something I&#39;m talking about here one</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.350" end="00:12:50.940" style="s2">or two measures taken on one or two</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.449" end="00:12:52.440" style="s2">variables once or twice is never enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.940" end="00:12:55.230" style="s2">to understand the complex phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.440" end="00:12:57.300" style="s2">full-stop every phenomenon I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.230" end="00:13:00.890" style="s2">about was a complex phenomenon that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.300" end="00:13:00.890" style="s2">measured this way or worse</p>
