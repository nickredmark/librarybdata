<p begin="00:00:02.570" end="00:00:06.920" style="s2">so I guess I first came across Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:10.340" style="s2">Peterson about nine or ten months ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.920" end="00:00:13.519" style="s2">something like that and what actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.340" end="00:00:16.250" style="s2">first made me sit up and take notice of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.519" end="00:00:18.080" style="s2">him was he was in an interview who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.250" end="00:00:20.060" style="s2">discussing materialist science and some</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.080" end="00:00:20.960" style="s2">of his issues with that and he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.060" end="00:00:22.700" style="s2">saying that the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:25.340" style="s2">materials that the material science is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.700" end="00:00:27.590" style="s2">consciousness and that as far as he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.340" end="00:00:34.420" style="s2">concerned consciousness was the means by</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.590" end="00:00:37.730" style="s2">which we turned or turn I should say the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.420" end="00:00:39.890" style="s2">chaos of potential that constantly</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.730" end="00:00:43.700" style="s2">surrounds us into meaningful manageable</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.890" end="00:00:44.900" style="s2">order and that really perked up my ears</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.700" end="00:00:47.380" style="s2">because as someone who&#39;s done quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.900" end="00:00:50.600" style="s2">lot of psychedelics that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.380" end="00:00:53.810" style="s2">somehow assembling our reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.600" end="00:00:56.450" style="s2">drawing it into focus from from around</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.810" end="00:00:59.210" style="s2">us really dived with my own experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.450" end="00:01:01.430" style="s2">and so I shortly after that became aware</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.210" end="00:01:04.519" style="s2">of the interview that he did with Kathy</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.430" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">Newman which went viral and I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.519" end="00:01:08.990" style="s2">started to pay attention to him because</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:10.580" style="s2">you know he was someone who for really</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.990" end="00:01:12.710" style="s2">the first time I can think about in</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.580" end="00:01:15.320" style="s2">recent times was actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.710" end="00:01:17.870" style="s2">shine a light on the true nature on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.320" end="00:01:20.060" style="s2">actualities of a situation and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.870" end="00:01:22.070" style="s2">although this video is actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.060" end="00:01:23.930" style="s2">primarily about a couple of issues that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.070" end="00:01:26.570" style="s2">I have with a couple of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.930" end="00:01:30.440" style="s2">precepts I want to spend the first part</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.570" end="00:01:32.390" style="s2">of it establishing my credentials as it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.440" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">were as someone who is not going to try</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.390" end="00:01:36.920" style="s2">and misrepresent him because he has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:40.479" style="s2">horribly willfully shamelessly</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.920" end="00:01:42.920" style="s2">misrepresented at times in the media and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.479" end="00:01:46.850" style="s2">so yet to establish my credibility as</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.920" end="00:01:47.630" style="s2">someone who a basically really likes</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.850" end="00:01:50.930" style="s2">what he has to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.630" end="00:01:53.180" style="s2">and be that I and you know that I get it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.930" end="00:01:56.229" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;m not trying to not</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.180" end="00:01:59.509" style="s2">try to twist his ideas in any way so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.229" end="00:02:01.580" style="s2">yeah I mean primarily I&#39;m grateful for</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.509" end="00:02:04.520" style="s2">the fact that he has raised the level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.580" end="00:02:07.130" style="s2">complexity and the level of truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.520" end="00:02:09.769" style="s2">that is required in debate at least in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.130" end="00:02:11.959" style="s2">some circles and some of his ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.769" end="00:02:13.730" style="s2">really beautiful he gave a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.959" end="00:02:15.370" style="s2">very impassioned speeches that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.730" end="00:02:18.220" style="s2">about free speech and political</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.370" end="00:02:21.909" style="s2">correctness and it ties together nicely</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.220" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">with one of the stories he retails in</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.909" end="00:02:26.530" style="s2">his Bible lectures so you know he gave</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:28.599" style="s2">the speech about free speech where he</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.530" end="00:02:31.030" style="s2">said the free speech is not just about</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.599" end="00:02:32.650" style="s2">the ability to speak freely and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.030" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">challenge the powerful although of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.650" end="00:02:37.569" style="s2">course it is also those things but more</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:40.090" style="s2">fundamentally that is the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.569" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">assemble meaningful order from chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.090" end="00:02:43.390" style="s2">so if you confront the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:45.220" style="s2">forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.390" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">with forthright action and truthful</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.220" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">speech then the order you will create</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">from the world is good and this is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:53.500" style="s2">is what in his opinion the story of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:55.269" style="s2">Genesis is all about that God created</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.500" end="00:02:56.859" style="s2">the world or the Word of God created the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.269" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">world in the world was good and then and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.859" end="00:03:01.629" style="s2">so if you do as God did as it were and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:04.359" style="s2">then that&#39;s not how he means that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.629" end="00:03:06.760" style="s2">is it&#39;s not the way he retells the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.359" end="00:03:09.909" style="s2">stories is not as revealed truth Word of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.760" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">God kind of thing it&#39;s about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.909" end="00:03:15.190" style="s2">assembled over long periods of time as</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">to how best to go about living a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.190" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">meaningful fulfilling life on this earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:24.880" style="s2">and so free speech is not just about as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.079" style="s2">I said speaking freely and challenging</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.880" end="00:03:30.030" style="s2">the powerful but is the means by which</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.079" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">we assemble our reality and if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:35.889" style="s2">assemble order from chaos by using</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:37.540" style="s2">anything less than forthright action and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.889" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">truthful speech then the order that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.540" end="00:03:41.859" style="s2">will assemble will be less than good and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2">potentially very ugly so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.859" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">a really lovely idea and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:47.949" style="s2">are a few that have stuck with me</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:03:50.760" style="s2">another one is his prime one of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.949" end="00:03:53.650" style="s2">other primary missions has been to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.760" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">empower people at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.650" end="00:04:00.010" style="s2">by explaining that the kind of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">and fulfillment that you find in life</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.010" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">that not only gives you joy in your good</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:06.430" style="s2">times but sustains you through your bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:09.819" style="s2">times is to be found in the adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.430" end="00:04:11.560" style="s2">personal responsibility and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.819" end="00:04:13.449" style="s2">not complaining and whining but actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.560" end="00:04:15.099" style="s2">doing your best to fix the circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.449" end="00:04:17.590" style="s2">of your life and taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.099" end="00:04:19.150" style="s2">for it when it goes wrong and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.590" end="00:04:22.210" style="s2">that he&#39;s absolutely right that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.150" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">correct level of analysis with which to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.210" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">fix the problems of society or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">individual level but later on I do kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:34.180" style="s2">of wish to take issue with</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:36.430" style="s2">with that in part and that if you do not</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.180" end="00:04:38.110" style="s2">do that if you do not bring the best of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.430" end="00:04:40.420" style="s2">yourself into this world if you do not</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.110" end="00:04:41.980" style="s2">manifest the talents that that are that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.420" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">are latent within you then what</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.980" end="00:04:46.480" style="s2">manifests in the world instead is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:49.540" style="s2">potentially something ugly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.480" end="00:04:51.220" style="s2">unpleasant and even evil and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.540" end="00:04:53.200" style="s2">this is a really lovely idea another one</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.220" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">not related in any way with another one</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.200" end="00:04:58.180" style="s2">that really stuck with me was was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:05:00.280" style="s2">concept that constraint can create</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.180" end="00:05:02.470" style="s2">possibility or does create possibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.280" end="00:05:04.540" style="s2">uses as these as an example the game of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.470" end="00:05:07.480" style="s2">chess so in the game of chess you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.540" end="00:05:09.910" style="s2">64 squares 32 of them white photos and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.480" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">black you got 32 pieces 16 white 16</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.910" end="00:05:15.040" style="s2">black but without the rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:17.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve got nothing you just</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.040" end="00:05:20.110" style="s2">whatever you just throw pieces around it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.140" end="00:05:22.180" style="s2">has no meaning only when you impose the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.110" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">constraints of this piece must move in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.180" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">this way one player must play after the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.919" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">other this is the objective which you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:30.130" style="s2">are trying to reach only then do the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:32.770" style="s2">strategies and the ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.130" end="00:05:36.370" style="s2">so on and become possible and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.770" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">constraint creates meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.370" end="00:05:40.690" style="s2">possibility and I love that idea in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:41.980" style="s2">like manner when you&#39;re learning a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.690" end="00:05:43.960" style="s2">musical instrument you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.980" end="00:05:46.690" style="s2">absolute freedom you know here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:48.310" style="s2">guitar go at it kind of thing or at</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.690" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">least unless you&#39;re a complete genius</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.310" end="00:05:53.860" style="s2">and natural genius at it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:57.760" style="s2">for most people the beginning process is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.860" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">a giving up of your personal freedom in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.760" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">order to learn the rules or if you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.410" style="s2">how to pick the notes how to construct</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:06.580" style="s2">the chords how to read the music etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.410" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">only when you have learned those rules</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.580" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">any of them when you&#39;ve learned that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:11.979" style="s2">structured to a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:14.470" style="s2">proficiency can you then begin to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.979" end="00:06:17.350" style="s2">express yourself you know your inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.470" end="00:06:19.450" style="s2">self through your music and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.350" end="00:06:23.760" style="s2">of you know having absolute freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.450" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">do anything at any time yeah this is</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.079" end="00:11:19.310" style="s2">areas on a focus on I&#39;ll do them one at</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">a time with a little banner at the start</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.310" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">of each one to tell you what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.529" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">okay so the first one I want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.630" end="00:11:31.100" style="s2">is his talk about hierarchies it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:33.529" style="s2">take me a while to unpack this because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.100" end="00:11:35.480" style="s2">first want to summarize his own line of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.529" end="00:11:38.930" style="s2">thinking and then talk about what my</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.480" end="00:11:40.430" style="s2">issue is with it so the first chapter of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.930" end="00:11:42.470" style="s2">his book is stand up straightening the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.430" end="00:11:44.630" style="s2">shoulders back and it&#39;s a talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.470" end="00:11:47.959" style="s2">exactly that hierarchy and he starts</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.630" end="00:11:49.220" style="s2">with lobsters and talks about how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.959" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">know the biggest strongest lobster gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.220" end="00:11:53.620" style="s2">the best catch and access to the hottest</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:56.390" style="s2">women and all that kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.620" end="00:11:59.810" style="s2">that the brain pathway in chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.390" end="00:12:02.810" style="s2">responsible for a lobsters recognition</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.810" end="00:12:05.810" style="s2">of its position in the hierarchy is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.810" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">same as we have in our own in our own</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.810" end="00:12:11.570" style="s2">brains in our own chemistry he then goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.820" style="s2">on to look at the evolving complexities</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.570" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">of hierarchies and you know goes from</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.820" end="00:12:20.060" style="s2">lobsters to wolves and fools to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:21.769" style="s2">chimpanzees and talks about how it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.060" end="00:12:24.050" style="s2">just the biggest strongest wolf or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.769" end="00:12:29.180" style="s2">biggest strongest chimpanzee that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.050" end="00:12:31.399" style="s2">leader of the pack because the Sociology</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.180" end="00:12:34.459" style="s2">is more complex and so you know with</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.399" end="00:12:36.440" style="s2">chimpanzees in particular the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.459" end="00:12:38.540" style="s2">strongest chimp if he&#39;s just a ugly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.440" end="00:12:39.860" style="s2">vicious tyrant world two or three other</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.540" end="00:12:42.440" style="s2">chimps will get together and bring him</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.860" end="00:12:43.880" style="s2">down and so you know just being the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.440" end="00:12:45.110" style="s2">biggest and the strongest is not enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.880" end="00:12:46.640" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve got to be big and strong but</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.110" end="00:12:49.310" style="s2">you also have to be able to negotiate</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.250" end="00:12:57.589" style="s2">goes on to talk about human hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.230" end="00:12:59.510" style="s2">and that human hierarchies are a whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.589" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">new evolution of the concept because</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.510" end="00:13:05.390" style="s2">within human society we can create new</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">hierarchies and so you have hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.390" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">of builders you have hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:10.910" style="s2">musicians you have hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">accountants and so on and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.910" end="00:13:15.529" style="s2">on so you have lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:18.140" style="s2">different hierarchies and in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.529" end="00:13:20.300" style="s2">society there are a sufficient variety</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.140" end="00:13:22.339" style="s2">of hierarchies that everybody can find a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.300" end="00:13:25.699" style="s2">position of some significance in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.339" end="00:13:27.079" style="s2">hierarchy somewhere or other and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.699" end="00:13:29.320" style="s2">therefore find some meaning and some</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.320" end="00:13:36.519" style="s2">he then talks about how all hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.889" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">these are susceptible to or tilt towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.519" end="00:13:42.819" style="s2">I think is the phrase that he uses</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:44.559" style="s2">corruption and tyranny and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.819" end="00:13:46.569" style="s2">recognize corruption attorney taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.559" end="00:13:49.929" style="s2">place in a hierarchy when people</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.569" end="00:13:52.449" style="s2">exercise power and influence in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.929" end="00:13:55.119" style="s2">ascend the hierarchy rather than merit</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.449" end="00:13:56.649" style="s2">that a healthy hierarchy people ascend</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.119" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">the hierarchy because they&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.649" end="00:14:01.679" style="s2">doing that thing you know so it&#39;s merit</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2">it&#39;s competence is the word that he uses</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.679" end="00:14:07.809" style="s2">which allows a healthy hierarchy to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:09.549" style="s2">ascended and with all of that I broadly</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.809" end="00:14:09.759" style="s2">agree I don&#39;t take issue with any of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.549" end="00:14:11.109" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.759" end="00:14:14.919" style="s2">I think I thought I think it&#39;s a I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.109" end="00:14:17.259" style="s2">it&#39;s a very well laid out schema however</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.919" end="00:14:19.949" style="s2">where I do take issue with him is where</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.259" end="00:14:23.499" style="s2">he starts to talk about how Western</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.949" end="00:14:25.299" style="s2">society is broadly healthy hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.499" end="00:14:27.759" style="s2">because they are based on competence and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.299" end="00:14:30.040" style="s2">he gives the example of you know how you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.759" end="00:14:31.689" style="s2">don&#39;t have bands of tyrannical plumbers</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.040" end="00:14:33.639" style="s2">going up and down the street demanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.689" end="00:14:36.459" style="s2">that you use their services that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.639" end="00:14:38.259" style="s2">plumbers are selected on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.459" end="00:14:40.749" style="s2">their ability to do the job when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.259" end="00:14:43.929" style="s2">want it to a sufficiently high level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.749" end="00:14:47.049" style="s2">competence and again I agree with all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.929" end="00:14:48.730" style="s2">that where I think he I don&#39;t know if he</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.049" end="00:14:52.389" style="s2">willfully omits it or simply doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.730" end="00:14:54.549" style="s2">fully appreciate it or maybe simply</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.389" end="00:14:59.499" style="s2">disagrees with with what I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.549" end="00:15:02.949" style="s2">say but the hierarchies in which all</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.499" end="00:15:05.169" style="s2">other hierarchies are embedded are those</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.949" end="00:15:07.089" style="s2">where the true power resides so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.169" end="00:15:08.649" style="s2">talking about finance we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.089" end="00:15:13.470" style="s2">about government and politics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.649" end="00:15:16.149" style="s2">talking about corporate influence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.470" end="00:15:18.009" style="s2">all other hierarchies are embedded</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.149" end="00:15:20.199" style="s2">within that particularly the money</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.009" end="00:15:22.929" style="s2">hierarchy I mean you you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.199" end="00:15:24.970" style="s2">get anything done in this world without</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.929" end="00:15:28.449" style="s2">the use of money in some way or another</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.970" end="00:15:30.819" style="s2">and so you know those that control the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.449" end="00:15:32.919" style="s2">the super hierarchies if you like in</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.819" end="00:15:35.529" style="s2">which all of the others are embedded are</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.919" end="00:15:38.589" style="s2">at a significant advantage and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.529" end="00:15:41.319" style="s2">he profoundly underestimates the degree</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.589" end="00:15:42.339" style="s2">to which our super hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.319" end="00:15:45.579" style="s2">indeed</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.339" end="00:15:47.860" style="s2">corrupt and I give us examples the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.579" end="00:15:50.189" style="s2">revolving door that exists between high</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.860" end="00:15:53.589" style="s2">levels of government and Finance I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.189" end="00:15:55.689" style="s2">one example that springs to mind is hank</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.589" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">paulson who you know previously senior</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.290" end="00:17:08.949" style="s2">it&#39;s broadly functional I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:10.899" style="s2">that profoundly I think that our super</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.949" end="00:17:14.970" style="s2">hierarchies as I refer to them early on</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.899" end="00:17:17.709" style="s2">the the real controlling hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.970" end="00:17:19.209" style="s2">controlled by a very few people for</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.709" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">their own ends I don&#39;t think there can</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.209" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">be any doubt of that in the light of all</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.480" style="s2">the stuff that we&#39;ve seen since the</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.480" end="00:17:30.700" style="s2">Peterson talks about the correct level</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.890" end="00:17:37.809" style="s2">individual I I broadly agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.929" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">however when there are systemic barriers</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.809" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">to that occurring then those systemic</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">barriers needs to be examined very</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:50.500" style="s2">carefully and I think there&#39;s a big gap</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.500" end="00:17:56.159" style="s2">when you look at the way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.409" end="00:17:59.710" style="s2">individuals and nations are hamstrung by</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.710" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">I mean just just one for example our</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.929" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">system of money because 97% of money is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">created as debt and debt carries</p>

<p begin="00:18:17.799" end="00:18:22.710" style="s2">less to actually go around and do</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.929" end="00:18:25.090" style="s2">commerce you know that it necessarily</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.330" end="00:22:29.710" style="s2">to highlight the fact that hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.120" end="00:22:31.720" style="s2">dispossessed lots and lots of people at</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.720" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">Peterson he does acknowledge the fact</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.940" end="00:23:01.000" style="s2">the frito distribution but anyway well</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.800" end="00:23:04.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve already talked about that what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.000" end="00:23:07.450" style="s2">want to talk about here is the left hat</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.690" end="00:23:10.440" style="s2">the left versus right thing as it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.450" end="00:23:12.650" style="s2">relates to the road to totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.440" end="00:23:14.630" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.650" end="00:23:16.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of laid the groundwork and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.630" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">those are the proper roles are the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.610" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">and right and that we know the right has</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:24.350" style="s2">gone too far when they start talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:27.650" style="s2">about racial purity or superiority or</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.350" end="00:23:29.390" style="s2">whatever but we don&#39;t really yet have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.650" end="00:23:32.120" style="s2">understanding of where the left has gone</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.390" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">too far in that despite his decades of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.120" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">research and writing on the subject he</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:40.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t think that he fully understands</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.700" end="00:23:42.440" style="s2">what the warning signals are when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.130" end="00:23:45.170" style="s2">going down the left-hand road to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:50.870" style="s2">totalitarianism so I kind of take issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.170" end="00:23:53.240" style="s2">with the whole meta suppositions on</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.870" end="00:23:55.010" style="s2">which this this discussion is based</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.240" end="00:23:57.380" style="s2">because as far as I&#39;m concerned and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.010" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">listen I&#39;m nowhere near as well read or</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.380" end="00:24:01.550" style="s2">as well educated on the topic as he is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:04.280" style="s2">and I&#39;m quite willing to accept the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.550" end="00:24:07.370" style="s2">possibility that I&#39;m missing something</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.280" end="00:24:09.770" style="s2">here however as far as I can see</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.370" end="00:24:13.090" style="s2">totalitarianism is totalitarianism it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.770" end="00:24:16.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t it is an attempt by the state to</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.100" end="00:24:19.970" style="s2">people right down to you know right down</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.470" end="00:24:22.580" style="s2">to the last detail and in order to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.970" end="00:24:25.670" style="s2">accomplish that needs to have very</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.670" end="00:24:30.740" style="s2">place in order to surveil and coerce its</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.809" end="00:24:37.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see totalitarian and now</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.220" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">fire is a simplistic as racial hatred</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.900" end="00:25:17.590" style="s2">wrote of totalitarianism is when the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.090" end="00:25:20.270" style="s2">state starts to exert excessive control</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.419" end="00:30:22.169" style="s2">me start by reiterating I think what</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.309" end="00:30:24.269" style="s2">he&#39;s done with the Bible stories is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.169" end="00:30:26.610" style="s2">remarkable I&#39;ve learned a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.269" end="00:30:27.809" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve seen of those lectures I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.610" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t watched all of I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.809" end="00:30:30.570" style="s2">about half of them but I&#39;ve learned a</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.570" end="00:30:41.659" style="s2">those lectures and once again the way he</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.630" end="00:30:44.490" style="s2">draws in other sources to create this</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.659" end="00:30:47.250" style="s2">broad perspective from which to view</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.490" end="00:30:51.169" style="s2">them has been for me anyway entirely</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.250" end="00:30:54.510" style="s2">original and and a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.169" end="00:30:56.190" style="s2">however specifically with Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.510" end="00:30:59.639" style="s2">and this is the religion with which he</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.190" end="00:31:01.139" style="s2">most clearly identifies himself</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.639" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">obviously I don&#39;t think that&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.889" style="s2">core something which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.220" end="00:31:14.730" style="s2">profoundly damaging and and I would like</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.889" end="00:31:18.289" style="s2">to explore a little bit here so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.730" end="00:31:22.769" style="s2">pretty sure it&#39;s in a story of Noah that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.289" end="00:31:27.059" style="s2">God undertakes to man never to do the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.769" end="00:31:30.029" style="s2">whole flood thing ever again and gives</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.059" end="00:31:33.779" style="s2">him dominion over the earth and over the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.029" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">animals and so um you know this story</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.779" end="00:31:37.559" style="s2">along with I suspect many others I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:40.139" style="s2">biblical scholar I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.559" end="00:31:41.580" style="s2">the Bible well reinforces something</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.139" end="00:31:43.500" style="s2">which to me is at the very very very</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.580" end="00:31:46.200" style="s2">core of Christianity which is an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.500" end="00:31:49.440" style="s2">separation between God man and nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.200" end="00:31:52.740" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like a triumvirate of three</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:55.559" style="s2">separate things that God created nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.740" end="00:31:58.889" style="s2">God created man got inserted man into</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.559" end="00:32:02.730" style="s2">nature and God gave man dominion over</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.889" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">nature and these ideas which I think run</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.730" end="00:32:09.929" style="s2">deep deep deep in the psyche of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:14.360" style="s2">Western mind are responsible in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.929" end="00:32:17.490" style="s2">opinion for a huge amount of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.490" end="00:32:23.610" style="s2">at the moment to give you an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.270" end="00:32:25.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about the or a better</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.610" end="00:32:27.030" style="s2">idea sure I should say what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.380" end="00:32:29.490" style="s2">about in the Eastern philosophies in</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.230" end="00:33:01.260" style="s2">I said that which you do to your world</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.650" end="00:33:03.000" style="s2">you do in a very very real way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.260" end="00:33:08.150" style="s2">yourself because you are the world and</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.059" end="00:33:30.809" style="s2">absent from Christianity and is for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.710" end="00:33:32.580" style="s2">the biggest reason not to be of that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.809" end="00:33:34.770" style="s2">mean I listen the teachings of Jesus</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.620" end="00:33:46.790" style="s2">by no means the first person to preach</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.750" end="00:33:49.890" style="s2">that kind of thing but the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.790" end="00:33:52.710" style="s2">mythology that underlies it and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.890" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">separation of God from man from nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.710" end="00:33:57.929" style="s2">and again I&#39;m quite willing to accept</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:59.429" style="s2">that there is a deficiency in my own</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.929" end="00:34:03.030" style="s2">understanding of Christianity like I</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.429" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">said I am no scholar but that that does</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.030" end="00:34:06.990" style="s2">seem to me to be and I&#39;m not the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:12.379" style="s2">one to think this as um Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.990" end="00:34:12.379" style="s2">Oh God his name escapes me</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:18.370" style="s2">begins of the sea I can&#39;t think of his</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:21.649" style="s2">name it&#39;ll come to me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.370" end="00:34:23.570" style="s2">talks about this also about about this</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.649" end="00:34:26.210" style="s2">failing in Christianity that it fails to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.570" end="00:34:28.429" style="s2">appreciate the divine in all things you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.210" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">know that all things have a soul all</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.429" end="00:34:35.659" style="s2">beings have a soul is not unique to man</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:39.830" style="s2">and this sense of superiority that man</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.659" end="00:34:42.860" style="s2">has and that he has the right to impose</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.830" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">his will through force over nature in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.860" end="00:34:48.139" style="s2">order to make life better for him all</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:50.120" style="s2">right I think is really you know because</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.139" end="00:34:52.760" style="s2">it encourages to sit encourages us to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.120" end="00:34:55.790" style="s2">see the world a bunch of stuff out there</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.760" end="00:34:58.340" style="s2">that we can use any way that we like and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.790" end="00:35:00.260" style="s2">that seems to me to be right at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.340" end="00:35:02.270" style="s2">heart of how we are able to treat the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.260" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">world as we do and I&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.270" end="00:35:07.970" style="s2">climate change just like mr. Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:09.500" style="s2">have deep suspicions about the climate</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.970" end="00:35:12.020" style="s2">change narrative which is being forced</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.500" end="00:35:13.250" style="s2">down my throat just for the very simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.020" end="00:35:14.540" style="s2">reason that it&#39;s being forced down my</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.250" end="00:35:16.700" style="s2">throat that makes me extremely</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.540" end="00:35:18.500" style="s2">suspicious but there is no doubt that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.700" end="00:35:20.150" style="s2">the amount of plastic we&#39;re throwing</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.500" end="00:35:22.280" style="s2">into the ground and into the enemies of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.150" end="00:35:25.210" style="s2">the water the toxification of freshwater</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.280" end="00:35:28.730" style="s2">supplies is stripping the forests the d</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.210" end="00:35:30.380" style="s2">the you know the lots of soil as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.730" end="00:35:32.690" style="s2">consequence of deforestation the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.380" end="00:35:35.300" style="s2">chemical runoff the blah blah blah mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.690" end="00:35:36.890" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a million things all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.300" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">which need urgent attention you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.890" end="00:35:41.090" style="s2">species die awfully there are many many</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:42.740" style="s2">things all of which need urgent</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.090" end="00:35:45.470" style="s2">attention and for me the climate change</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.740" end="00:35:47.150" style="s2">narrative is once again a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.470" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">from doing anything about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.150" end="00:35:51.350" style="s2">things which actually there are ready</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:53.450" style="s2">available solutions to instead we&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.350" end="00:35:55.790" style="s2">busy squabbling about who&#39;s right over</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.450" end="00:36:01.430" style="s2">climate change but anyway that to one</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.790" end="00:36:05.840" style="s2">side that narrative and again for to mr.</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.430" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">Peterson thank you for internet Conrad</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.840" end="00:36:11.330" style="s2">no it&#39;s not Conrad anyway thank you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:16.340" style="s2">again for introducing me to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.330" end="00:36:18.230" style="s2">the power of story to shape not only our</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.340" end="00:36:22.900" style="s2">reality but the way that we function in</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.230" end="00:36:26.740" style="s2">the world and but I but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.900" end="00:36:28.960" style="s2">adhering to and internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:33.010" style="s2">flawed stories is extremely dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.960" end="00:36:36.070" style="s2">and and for me the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.010" end="00:36:38.860" style="s2">narrative of God man nature is is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.070" end="00:36:41.980" style="s2">deeply deeply fought it encourages us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.860" end="00:36:45.400" style="s2">exploit and destroy the world around us</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.980" end="00:36:47.860" style="s2">and not to honor cherish worship it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.400" end="00:36:49.450" style="s2">every action that in every action</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.860" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">interaction that we take with it there</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.450" end="00:36:53.560" style="s2">is no way if we saw every being as</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.540" style="s2">having a soul very much like our own</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.560" end="00:36:57.490" style="s2">that we would treat our livestock the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.540" end="00:36:59.140" style="s2">way that we do for example you know we</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.490" end="00:37:01.210" style="s2">love our pets and yet we go down and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.140" end="00:37:03.160" style="s2">buy steaks anyway again it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.210" end="00:37:05.970" style="s2">a thing I want to get into but but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.160" end="00:37:11.430" style="s2">hope I&#39;ve made my point</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.970" end="00:37:11.430" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;ll just wrap up</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.240" end="00:37:16.810" style="s2">okay so first of all it was Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:18.310" style="s2">Campbell I was talking about not Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.810" end="00:37:19.620" style="s2">Conrad he wrote parts of darkness of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.310" end="00:37:25.120" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.620" end="00:37:27.730" style="s2">Joseph Campbell was also very into</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.120" end="00:37:29.620" style="s2">mythology on his whole life exploring</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.730" end="00:37:32.940" style="s2">mythology from all over the world in</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.620" end="00:37:34.780" style="s2">particular looking for similarities</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.940" end="00:37:37.090" style="s2">cross-cultural cross temporal</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.780" end="00:37:38.710" style="s2">similarities and then looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.090" end="00:37:41.260" style="s2">differences in order to isolate what was</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.710" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">cultural and what was you know deeply</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.260" end="00:37:45.910" style="s2">embedded in the human psyche not</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.510" end="00:37:48.730" style="s2">dissimilar to well in fact was informed</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.910" end="00:37:51.640" style="s2">by Jung&#39;s work as is Jordan Peterson so</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.730" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">once again thanks to mr. Peterson for</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.640" end="00:37:55.510" style="s2">not directing me there he didn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:57.820" style="s2">personally but it was as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.510" end="00:37:58.600" style="s2">of listening to Jordan Peterson stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.820" end="00:38:01.720" style="s2">that I came across</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.600" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">Joseph Campbell as well so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.720" end="00:38:07.180" style="s2">points that Campbell makes is that when</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:10.390" style="s2">things are changing very rapidly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.180" end="00:38:12.280" style="s2">impossible for new mythologies to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.390" end="00:38:16.090" style="s2">because it obviously takes time for them</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.280" end="00:38:18.670" style="s2">to find expression and you know he was</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.090" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">he was writing primarily back in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.670" end="00:38:23.350" style="s2">70s but that saying is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:24.940" style="s2">today even more so that things are</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.350" end="00:38:27.430" style="s2">changing so quickly that is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.940" end="00:38:31.090" style="s2">all but impossible for new myths new</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.430" end="00:38:33.700" style="s2">stories to develop but I guess if there</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.090" end="00:38:37.360" style="s2">is an overarching point to this video</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.700" end="00:38:40.600" style="s2">then it would be a plea for people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.360" end="00:38:42.850" style="s2">try and let will make room for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.600" end="00:38:45.400" style="s2">possibility of new stories in their</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.850" end="00:38:47.350" style="s2">minds and in their hearts because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.400" end="00:38:50.020" style="s2">ones that we currently have our stories</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.350" end="00:38:55.500" style="s2">of money are stories of judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.020" end="00:38:59.500" style="s2">tradition our stories of power and so on</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.500" end="00:39:01.720" style="s2">are all rooted in what Charles</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.500" end="00:39:04.120" style="s2">Eisenstein refers to as the story of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.720" end="00:39:05.530" style="s2">separation where you know as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.120" end="00:39:07.150" style="s2">already talked about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.530" end="00:39:09.610" style="s2">world&#39;s a bunch of stuff out there which</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.150" end="00:39:11.470" style="s2">is which is for us to use and where</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.610" end="00:39:13.060" style="s2">we&#39;re not in any way personally</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.470" end="00:39:15.310" style="s2">connected with it in our stories don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.060" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">allow us to be you know we see</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.310" end="00:39:18.760" style="s2">everything in physical terms that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:22.290" style="s2">ourselves our awareness our</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.760" end="00:39:24.790" style="s2">consciousness is nothing more than the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.290" end="00:39:26.020" style="s2">consequence of chemical reactions taking</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.790" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">place axons and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.020" end="00:39:31.180" style="s2">electrons and you know waves of energy</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:34.840" style="s2">moving according to deterministic laws</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.180" end="00:39:37.300" style="s2">and I mean I can&#39;t prove it&#39;s otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.840" end="00:39:39.100" style="s2">but my own experience doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.300" end="00:39:41.290" style="s2">that nobody&#39;s experience feels like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.100" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">and so you know if it looks like a dark</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.290" end="00:39:44.410" style="s2">and smells like a duck it&#39;s a duck or</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:48.120" style="s2">whatever the phrase is is something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.410" end="00:39:53.290" style="s2">that it escapes me exactly where it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.120" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">so yeah we really need to start coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.290" end="00:40:02.040" style="s2">up with circulating reinforcing telling</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:06.390" style="s2">ourselves new kinds of stories where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.040" end="00:40:09.190" style="s2">underlying substrate is one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.390" end="00:40:11.560" style="s2">connectedness and not of separation</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.190" end="00:40:13.030" style="s2">because however much you deny the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.560" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">reality of the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.030" end="00:40:15.790" style="s2">connected to everything around us</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:18.910" style="s2">everything around us if you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.790" end="00:40:20.170" style="s2">part of it and it&#39;s part of us even if</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.910" end="00:40:21.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe that it doesn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.170" end="00:40:23.160" style="s2">it being true it doesn&#39;t stop the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.430" end="00:40:26.020" style="s2">consequences of our actions being</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.160" end="00:40:29.400" style="s2">devastating ultimately to ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.020" end="00:40:32.230" style="s2">so you know if for nothing other than</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.400" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">self-interest we really need to start</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.230" end="00:40:36.430" style="s2">developing some new stories anyway I&#39;m</p>
