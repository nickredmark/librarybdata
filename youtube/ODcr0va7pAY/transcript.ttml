<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.449" style="s2">this is instead of the usual trend of</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.860" end="00:00:05.250" style="s2">people attacking each other&#39;s belief</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.449" end="00:00:07.890" style="s2">systems I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.250" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">important question and it has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">an extensive answer I&#39;ll concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">more on the second part of the answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:16.980" style="s2">which is the recommendation for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">practices I think a lot of the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:23.420" style="s2">problems can be found within ideological</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:26.550" style="s2">systems both within the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.420" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">partaking or participating in those</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.550" end="00:00:34.160" style="s2">ideologies and with the the way sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">groups are also organized around</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.160" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">ideologies the main thing I think the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">the the main kind of risk that I see</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:49.289" style="s2">ideologies going for is an attempt for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:52.469" style="s2">kind of cognitive closure a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.289" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">completeness as many people have pointed</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.469" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">out this is not an idea original to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a totalizing aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">ideologies and I think not only does</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">that of course trap us within</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">propositional thinking and disconnect us</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">from procedural perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">participatory and I&#39;ve argued at length</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:16.040" style="s2">why I think that&#39;s the case and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">profound I think the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.040" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">ideologies push for this totalization</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">and closure puts them fundamentally at</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">odds with both the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">relevance realization as something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:31.860" style="s2">is ongoing and evolving and if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">allow me a metaphor the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.860" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">reality which is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">inexhaustible and dynamically unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:44.659" style="s2">and so I think the risk for the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:48.619" style="s2">sort of specific to ideologies is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.659" end="00:01:54.200" style="s2">exactly the way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.619" end="00:01:54.200" style="s2">prematurely and permanently try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.740" end="00:02:02.860" style="s2">inappropriately collapse the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:05.230" style="s2">combine the complexity of reality and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.860" end="00:02:08.650" style="s2">our cognition combined it so we all need</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.230" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">to do that we have to at times compress</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.650" end="00:02:15.610" style="s2">and collapse the complexity but when</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">then that is coupled to claims of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.610" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">certainty and that therefore justify</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:24.880" style="s2">actions undertaken in the name of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:28.360" style="s2">audiology that&#39;s particularly where all</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.880" end="00:02:32.350" style="s2">of this becomes deeply deeply dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.360" end="00:02:35.230" style="s2">and when when that happens all of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.350" end="00:02:39.100" style="s2">paradigmatic propositions and pictures</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.230" end="00:02:41.290" style="s2">that we use to try and clarify things</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.100" end="00:02:43.420" style="s2">for ourselves actually start to blind us</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.290" end="00:02:48.580" style="s2">in a powerful way so the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.420" end="00:02:50.440" style="s2">becomes a a kind of self-deception in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.580" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">the thing that is supposed to provide a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.440" end="00:02:54.970" style="s2">framing lens for us actually become</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:57.400" style="s2">something opaquely blinding and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.970" end="00:03:01.330" style="s2">looking at it rather than looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.400" end="00:03:05.130" style="s2">through it and so in that in that way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.330" end="00:03:07.570" style="s2">thinking I want to use a biblical term</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.130" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">to describe what I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.570" end="00:03:12.220" style="s2">besetting problem is a risk for ideal</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:13.810" style="s2">ideologies and it&#39;s a nice one because</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.220" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">it&#39;s mnemonic and that&#39;s idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.810" end="00:03:21.370" style="s2">so idolatry is when we forget not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">in assertion but if forget in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.370" end="00:03:30.340" style="s2">existential mode how much our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:35.050" style="s2">and how much reality transcend our</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.340" end="00:03:36.880" style="s2">egocentric grasp and that we can lose</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.050" end="00:03:39.130" style="s2">our connection of allow me some</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.130" end="00:03:47.650" style="s2">what is ultimate when we forget that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:53.470" style="s2">we take our belief systems to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.650" end="00:03:57.160" style="s2">complete consistent and finished and of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.470" end="00:03:59.320" style="s2">course you can even here go deleon</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.160" end="00:04:05.709" style="s2">reasons why that&#39;s ultimately a failed</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.320" end="00:04:10.180" style="s2">project we have to find better ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.709" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">addressing the existential anxieties</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.180" end="00:04:17.299" style="s2">that people attempt to alleviate</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:20.930" style="s2">through ideologies and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.299" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">proposing is we need two kinds of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.930" end="00:04:29.979" style="s2">practices that will help address this</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:35.150" style="s2">tendency towards closure perfectionism</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.979" end="00:04:40.430" style="s2">certainty idolatry of ideologies we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.150" end="00:04:43.009" style="s2">ones that make us capable of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.430" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">with incompleteness dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.009" end="00:04:48.970" style="s2">imperfection and still valuing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:51.590" style="s2">connections that are being formed within</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.970" end="00:04:53.539" style="s2">cognitive processes that cannot bring a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.590" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">certainty cannot bring this completeness</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.539" end="00:04:57.889" style="s2">cannot bring this finality stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">pretending that it might get made me a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.889" end="00:05:02.830" style="s2">bit a little little harsher but stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:07.250" style="s2">pretending that we have achieved these</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.830" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">and so one set of practices would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.250" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">needed in order to make people more</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:14.270" style="s2">comfortable dealing with the existential</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:16.550" style="s2">anxieties that are often triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.270" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">ambiguity uncertainty and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.550" end="00:05:20.810" style="s2">whole host of practices around this many</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:23.630" style="s2">of them have to do with helping to train</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.810" end="00:05:25.159" style="s2">people in mindfulness to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.630" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">look at their processing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.159" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">automatically looking through it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">cognitive reframing things of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.840" end="00:05:34.280" style="s2">people also have to do their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:36.289" style="s2">particular psychodynamic work and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.280" end="00:05:38.750" style="s2">whatever practices will help address</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.289" end="00:05:41.630" style="s2">that to alleviate their idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.750" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">causes of anxiety so you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.630" end="00:05:49.250" style="s2">need a set of practices for reducing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:53.380" style="s2">anxiety then I would say you need a set</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.250" end="00:05:56.840" style="s2">of practices that get people more</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.380" end="00:05:58.760" style="s2">familiar with a flowing thought the flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.840" end="00:06:02.449" style="s2">state in particular that flowing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.760" end="00:06:05.990" style="s2">coupled miss to reality in which the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.449" end="00:06:10.039" style="s2">what makes the experience so wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.990" end="00:06:13.630" style="s2">is not any sense of it being fixed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.039" end="00:06:16.250" style="s2">complete and closed but per but instead</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.630" end="00:06:19.490" style="s2">exactly the opposite the flow state is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.250" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">so wondrous to people for us because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.490" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">takes them to the edge of awe it takes</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">them to the sense of ongoing opening</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:26.610" style="s2">ongoing discovery so this of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:29.009" style="s2">leads</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.610" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">the general point which is the set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.009" end="00:06:33.900" style="s2">wisdom practices that are needed are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:38.069" style="s2">ones that are going to achieve some kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.900" end="00:06:41.550" style="s2">of reciprocal opening and an agog a so</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.069" end="00:06:43.889" style="s2">you have anxiety reduction practices you</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.550" end="00:06:45.419" style="s2">have an agogic practices and then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.889" end="00:06:47.250" style="s2">third kind of practice you want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.419" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">in is the one I&#39;m doing a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.250" end="00:06:51.960" style="s2">right now especially with Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.500" end="00:06:53.669" style="s2">master Pietro and Peter Lindbergh and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.960" end="00:06:56.009" style="s2">then all the excellent discussions I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.669" end="00:06:59.099" style="s2">having with guys in stock and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.009" end="00:07:01.979" style="s2">Hall and also with Andrew Sweeney this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.099" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">is the the set of practices that I call</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.979" end="00:07:07.409" style="s2">dialectic that are designed to engender</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:12.029" style="s2">deea logos these are practices in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.409" end="00:07:15.509" style="s2">we try to bring into our dialoguing with</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.029" end="00:07:18.120" style="s2">other that feature of reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.509" end="00:07:20.810" style="s2">and we try to reorient towards the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.120" end="00:07:23.279" style="s2">what&#39;s our what we&#39;re valuing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.810" end="00:07:25.889" style="s2">valuing our ability to connect to each</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.279" end="00:07:30.330" style="s2">other ourselves and reality and to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.889" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">evolve our meaning making machinery and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.330" end="00:07:36.270" style="s2">so what&#39;s interesting is Peter and I are</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:40.650" style="s2">exploring the idea of a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.270" end="00:07:43.620" style="s2">emerging biological practices and I will</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.650" end="00:07:47.159" style="s2">go into this in great length when I when</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.620" end="00:07:50.009" style="s2">I&#39;m in the series after Socrates but we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.159" end="00:07:52.949" style="s2">need practices and one practice that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.009" end="00:07:55.289" style="s2">might do this is Ivan Russia&#39;s practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.949" end="00:07:58.259" style="s2">on empathy circling because what it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:11.550" style="s2">a sort of group mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.759" end="00:08:16.500" style="s2">that gets people into a kind of sink</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.550" end="00:08:19.020" style="s2">there&#39;s various other practices that you</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.020" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">shift people into getting the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.189" end="00:08:28.680" style="s2">right for a collective flow state within</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.870" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">flowing what it what you can then do is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.630" end="00:08:39.419" style="s2">think about there&#39;s a lot here so but</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:39.840" style="s2">you can think about a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.419" end="00:08:41.600" style="s2">you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.840" end="00:08:45.090" style="s2">resonance in which you&#39;re moving between</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.600" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">immersion in the practice in which you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.090" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">are exemplifying meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:52.050" style="s2">perhaps exemplifying reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:55.470" style="s2">and exemplifying wisdom and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.050" end="00:08:58.110" style="s2">stepping back and noting it explicate</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.470" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">drawing that out and then bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.110" end="00:09:02.520" style="s2">sort of philosophical questionings not</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:05.160" style="s2">as abstract theorizing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.520" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">something that is going to be woven into</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.160" end="00:09:08.970" style="s2">the flowing texture of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:12.630" style="s2">the question might be well what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.970" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">meaning what is wisdom what is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.630" end="00:09:18.870" style="s2">to love someone else and to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:23.520" style="s2">into the dialogue and I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.870" end="00:09:25.650" style="s2">shifted to these dialogical processes we</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.520" end="00:09:27.900" style="s2">could do the most important shift which</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.650" end="00:09:29.850" style="s2">is indicative of rationality so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.900" end="00:09:32.790" style="s2">proposing is let&#39;s try to bring into our</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.850" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">collective processes one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.790" end="00:09:37.350" style="s2">things that is a marker of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:39.420" style="s2">and individuals one of the key things</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.350" end="00:09:42.210" style="s2">that Marxist rationality individuals is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.420" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">a shift off the fixation on the product</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.210" end="00:09:49.710" style="s2">and the position that you&#39;re taking and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">shift on to participation in a process</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.710" end="00:09:57.150" style="s2">and that if we could that that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:09:59.250" style="s2">suggesting that is what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.150" end="00:10:03.330" style="s2">figure out how to bring into our</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.250" end="00:10:07.050" style="s2">collective distributed cognition ability</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.330" end="00:10:09.780" style="s2">to as groups shift off product and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.050" end="00:10:13.110" style="s2">position and shift into participation in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.780" end="00:10:18.030" style="s2">process because what we need is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.110" end="00:10:22.040" style="s2">another ideology we&#39;ve had that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.030" end="00:10:26.970" style="s2">tried that we keep trying it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.040" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">instead what we need is a reconnection</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.970" end="00:10:34.020" style="s2">with the lifeblood of wisdom and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:38.520" style="s2">making that is what we need and we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.020" end="00:10:41.480" style="s2">do that we can we weave collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.520" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">intelligence and we can spin it into</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.480" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">collective rationality and together we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:49.530" style="s2">can aspire to collective wisdom because</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.529" style="s2">that&#39;s what we need to solve our</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.530" end="00:10:55.410" style="s2">problems so thank you Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.529" end="00:10:57.540" style="s2">very extensive sorry at that very</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.410" end="00:11:00.209" style="s2">important question and I hope my</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.540" end="00:11:03.329" style="s2">somewhat extensive answer at least is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.209" end="00:11:07.470" style="s2">good grounds for thought and further</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.329" end="00:11:10.470" style="s2">discussion between us the next question</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.470" end="00:11:13.019" style="s2">is from the patron McKenzie Levitt it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.470" end="00:11:16.980" style="s2">always good to get questions from</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.019" end="00:11:19.439" style="s2">McKenzie always appreciated the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.980" end="00:11:21.209" style="s2">is for you personally on your own</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.439" end="00:11:24.149" style="s2">journey how would you describe the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.209" end="00:11:26.819" style="s2">important insight you&#39;ve ever had who</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.149" end="00:11:31.769" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a rough one in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.819" end="00:11:34.829" style="s2">trying to sort of decide I guess the one</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.769" end="00:11:39.889" style="s2">I would pick because it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.829" end="00:11:45.170" style="s2">route insight to a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.889" end="00:11:49.230" style="s2">was one I had so a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.170" end="00:11:51.180" style="s2">autobiographic set up the context so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.230" end="00:11:54.449" style="s2">finished my PhD and I sort of zeroed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.180" end="00:11:56.129" style="s2">on this problem of relevance and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.449" end="00:11:58.559" style="s2">crucial it is and I&#39;d done some work</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.129" end="00:12:00.389" style="s2">with my very good friend and she happy</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.559" end="00:12:01.860" style="s2">but difficulties about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.389" end="00:12:06.829" style="s2">generate scientific theories of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.860" end="00:12:08.910" style="s2">relevance and I had become quite sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.829" end="00:12:10.439" style="s2">depressed part of it was I was done my</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.910" end="00:12:13.500" style="s2">PhD and whenever you&#39;re done your PhD</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.439" end="00:12:18.389" style="s2">you just go into a depression but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.500" end="00:12:20.490" style="s2">other the other aspect of it was for</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.389" end="00:12:22.769" style="s2">reasons that I take a lot of time to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.490" end="00:12:24.209" style="s2">articulate in the series and so I hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.769" end="00:12:25.589" style="s2">I&#39;m not being presumptuous now I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.209" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">of relevance realization is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.589" end="00:12:31.319" style="s2">fundamentally central to our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.290" end="00:12:33.870" style="s2">agency to our meaning-making to our</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.319" end="00:12:35.879" style="s2">meaning in life to our experience of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.870" end="00:12:38.100" style="s2">religio or experience of the sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.879" end="00:12:42.089" style="s2">and this had all become clear to me and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.100" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">then it was like well I&#39;d seem to got to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.089" end="00:12:46.889" style="s2">a place where there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:49.649" style="s2">explanation for this there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.889" end="00:12:51.149" style="s2">scientific explanation even possible for</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.649" end="00:12:56.629" style="s2">this for some of the reasons I actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.149" end="00:12:56.629" style="s2">cover in this series and that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.130" end="00:13:06.010" style="s2">a really sort of weird an uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.970" end="00:13:08.260" style="s2">place was kind of deep stuckness in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.010" end="00:13:10.780" style="s2">life in its it made me feel like there</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.260" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">was a kind of perspective of clash and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.780" end="00:13:19.480" style="s2">absurdity between my scientific work and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:23.470" style="s2">might embodied existence but then I had</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.480" end="00:13:26.080" style="s2">the insight that I didn&#39;t need a theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.470" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">of relevance what I actually needed was</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.080" end="00:13:30.070" style="s2">a theory of relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:32.950" style="s2">that that was deeply analogous to what</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.070" end="00:13:37.900" style="s2">Darwin had done and then that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.950" end="00:13:41.560" style="s2">unlocked everything for me in a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.900" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">profound way and that insight has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.560" end="00:13:45.460" style="s2">sort of a touchstone for me I keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:48.300" style="s2">coming back to it again and again again</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.460" end="00:13:51.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why I got perhaps a little bit I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.300" end="00:13:54.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know brusque when I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.010" end="00:13:57.250" style="s2">about ideologies right the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.520" end="00:14:00.490" style="s2">come up with a definition a final</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.250" end="00:14:03.580" style="s2">account a perfect rendering of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.490" end="00:14:06.640" style="s2">relevant what&#39;s sacred what&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.580" end="00:14:11.860" style="s2">real to us like these are all deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.640" end="00:14:15.970" style="s2">deeply misplaced and that comes from for</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.860" end="00:14:19.750" style="s2">me the depth I believe the depth of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.970" end="00:14:21.880" style="s2">insight that we can&#39;t have a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.750" end="00:14:23.380" style="s2">relevance but we can have a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.880" end="00:14:25.750" style="s2">relevance realization and we therefore</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.380" end="00:14:29.130" style="s2">need to fundamentally reorient how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.750" end="00:14:34.650" style="s2">understand knowledge meaning making</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.029" end="00:15:07.829" style="s2">about 18 hours of lecture to try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.899" end="00:15:08.999" style="s2">answer that question because I think the</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.399" end="00:23:56.250" style="s2">are devices that are the opposite that</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.250" end="00:24:00.269" style="s2">had sort of an Aristotelian idea here</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.500" end="00:24:02.010" style="s2">that when we talk about a vice with</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.269" end="00:24:06.659" style="s2">respect to a virtue we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.010" end="00:24:09.539" style="s2">vices both of excess and vices of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.659" end="00:24:11.700" style="s2">deficit I think what a virtue is it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.539" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">very very very much overlapping with</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.700" end="00:24:17.519" style="s2">what a virtual engine is it&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:21.480" style="s2">enabling constraints that that lift you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.519" end="00:24:23.899" style="s2">away from vices of deficiency and then a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.480" end="00:24:27.740" style="s2">set a set of selective constraints that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.899" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">keep you from vices of excess and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.740" end="00:24:34.169" style="s2">therefore they constantly help evolve</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.169" end="00:24:40.500" style="s2">you much better track our normative</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.500" end="00:24:45.690" style="s2">the classic example is of course</p>

<p begin="00:25:12.299" end="00:25:16.850" style="s2">could jump off cliffs and run into</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.100" end="00:25:20.669" style="s2">traffic and that&#39;s not a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.850" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">precisely because right it&#39;s you you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.580" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">of excess but right the there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.500" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">vice of cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:47.190" style="s2">where you let right that fear blinds you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:50.549" style="s2">and prevent you from doing what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.190" end="00:25:53.249" style="s2">be done seeing how things really are and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.549" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">of course those are often related so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.249" end="00:25:57.509" style="s2">need an abling constraints that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:26:00.450" style="s2">literally encourage you that motivates</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.509" end="00:26:03.179" style="s2">you that make you consider more options</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.450" end="00:26:05.580" style="s2">that that open you up and provoke you to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.179" end="00:26:08.519" style="s2">explore and take a risk and take a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.580" end="00:26:11.789" style="s2">chance and so what you&#39;ve seen of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.519" end="00:26:13.710" style="s2">is that you know I&#39;m describing vices</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.789" end="00:26:16.289" style="s2">and virtues in terms of the same is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.710" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">shaded by which I explain relevance</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.289" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">realization because as I as I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:24.509" style="s2">trying to indicate virtue I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:28.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a virtue originally met power a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.509" end="00:26:32.970" style="s2">virtue is a capacity it is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.230" end="00:26:36.539" style="s2">seeing and being that such that you see</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.970" end="00:26:38.999" style="s2">through various kinds of illusions and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.539" end="00:26:41.970" style="s2">self-deceptions and you see into the</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.970" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">us in the sense of a like a being</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.740" end="00:26:58.590" style="s2">and beautiful so I think you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.309" end="00:27:02.730" style="s2">think about each one of the cardinal</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.590" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2">virtues and vices of excess and vices of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.730" end="00:27:11.179" style="s2">deficiency I I would recommend those as</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:11.179" style="s2">the primary vices you attempt to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.019" end="00:27:16.529" style="s2">this is from the patron Elmo I was</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:53.799" style="s2">like Schlegel and others</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.149" end="00:27:56.469" style="s2">that has put me on - oh I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.799" end="00:27:59.649" style="s2">the name of this author he&#39;s writing</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.649" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">I guess I&#39;m coming to a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.419" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">similar to some of these authors I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:21.909" style="s2">reading insofar as Goethe was attempting</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:27.460" style="s2">to propose a science to challenge Newton</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.909" end="00:28:30.999" style="s2">good - loses but I think what good - one</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.460" end="00:28:35.320" style="s2">way of reinterpreting Goethe is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.999" end="00:28:38.109" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing is indicating a new way</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.320" end="00:28:40.330" style="s2">of seeing that recan we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.109" end="00:28:41.950" style="s2">much more broadly about your whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.330" end="00:28:43.389" style="s2">sensory motor loop in the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.950" end="00:28:45.639" style="s2">coupled to the world sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.389" end="00:28:47.169" style="s2">perspectival and participatory aspects</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.639" end="00:28:48.789" style="s2">of knowing and that&#39;s what I want to put</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.169" end="00:28:51.419" style="s2">my finger on I think what good is doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.789" end="00:28:53.619" style="s2">is a way of seeing and being that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.419" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2">reconnects us to the procedural the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.619" end="00:28:57.580" style="s2">perspectival and the participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.450" end="00:29:00.669" style="s2">therefore discloses aspects of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.580" end="00:29:03.399" style="s2">and the reality that are only disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.669" end="00:29:07.469" style="s2">through those kinds of knowing and so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.399" end="00:29:12.129" style="s2">think good does work is is very</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.469" end="00:29:14.469" style="s2">important well to me it&#39;s the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.129" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">I&#39;m hesitating is there&#39;s that work and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.469" end="00:29:21.759" style="s2">the work he did on the understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:23.289" style="s2">deep understanding of symbolism these</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.759" end="00:29:25.839" style="s2">there&#39;s an intuition in my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.289" end="00:29:27.549" style="s2">they&#39;re deeply connected and but I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.839" end="00:29:29.499" style="s2">not confident right now and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.549" end="00:29:31.989" style="s2">articulate what that intuition looks</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.499" end="00:29:34.269" style="s2">like so I apologize for my hesitancy but</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.989" end="00:29:38.109" style="s2">there there&#39;s something going on there</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.269" end="00:29:41.229" style="s2">right you know that that this new way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.109" end="00:29:45.219" style="s2">seeing and being that reconnects us</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.229" end="00:29:47.169" style="s2">takes us into our deepest existential</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.219" end="00:29:49.389" style="s2">and ultimate concerns because though</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.169" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">those kinds of knowing are actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.389" end="00:29:55.479" style="s2">appropriate the the perspectival and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:57.879" style="s2">participatory especially are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.479" end="00:29:59.870" style="s2">appropriate for our existential and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.879" end="00:30:01.639" style="s2">ultimate concerns</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.870" end="00:30:03.610" style="s2">and the way you know good to try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.639" end="00:30:07.789" style="s2">break out of both empiricism and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.610" end="00:30:09.529" style="s2">rationalism or positivism or empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.789" end="00:30:10.909" style="s2">because those all sort of trade around</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.529" end="00:30:13.519" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.909" end="00:30:15.860" style="s2">I think they yeah that&#39;s also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.519" end="00:30:18.950" style="s2">consonant with how I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.860" end="00:30:20.750" style="s2">back to you know the transitivity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.950" end="00:30:22.370" style="s2">disclosed and prospective and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.750" end="00:30:24.769" style="s2">participatory knowing and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.370" end="00:30:26.539" style="s2">also what good to look at me I&#39;m doing</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:32.389" style="s2">think that&#39;s an excellent question and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.019" end="00:30:36.860" style="s2">that this is this is a line of thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.389" end="00:30:40.610" style="s2">I&#39;m currently pursuing in depth we have</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.330" end="00:32:16.280" style="s2">simultaneously is something that</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:36.590" style="s2">good question and I think the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.580" end="00:32:39.110" style="s2">that that you know there are that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.590" end="00:32:42.530" style="s2">addition to sort of you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.110" end="00:32:45.470" style="s2">you know the the basic s1 s2 distinction</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.530" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">you know where s1 is very bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.470" end="00:32:52.250" style="s2">self organizing and s2 is very top-down</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">and and linear I think we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.250" end="00:33:00.440" style="s2">a lot more specificity that kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.740" end="00:33:04.450" style="s2">individual style that indeed that would</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.440" end="00:33:07.190" style="s2">be expressed in how people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.450" end="00:33:09.049" style="s2">addressing their see part of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.190" end="00:33:11.299" style="s2">rationality and character and this is in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.049" end="00:33:13.820" style="s2">wrist at an idea right is your character</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.299" end="00:33:18.260" style="s2">your carrot you cultivate your character</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.820" end="00:33:20.830" style="s2">not just to aspire to what is good which</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.260" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">we all should do generically but also</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.830" end="00:33:26.690" style="s2">idiosyncratically to compensate for your</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:30.049" style="s2">own personal proclivities and tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.690" end="00:33:33.410" style="s2">towards vice or deficiency right so how</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.049" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">so if you know if I&#39;m tending to because</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.410" end="00:33:37.610" style="s2">of my background in my Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">towards being a coward the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.610" end="00:33:42.919" style="s2">I need to be more rational is I need I</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">need a style that emphasizes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.919" end="00:33:47.900" style="s2">practices that enhance my ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:52.570" style="s2">through the self you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.900" end="00:33:56.059" style="s2">universal ways in which human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.570" end="00:33:58.360" style="s2">pursuing rationality and have particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.059" end="00:34:01.580" style="s2">cognitive a cognitive styles around that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.360" end="00:34:05.179" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s going to be there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.580" end="00:34:08.540" style="s2">be very specific ways in which people</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.179" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">are cultivating their rational character</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.540" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">their ability to reason etc that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:16.070" style="s2">going to be idiosyncratically reflective</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:17.570" style="s2">and this of course this of course yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:19.970" style="s2">this makes sense because this was</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.570" end="00:34:22.310" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s idea right that the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.970" end="00:34:24.590" style="s2">virtue is always relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.310" end="00:34:26.190" style="s2">individual and of course for Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.590" end="00:34:28.109" style="s2">who has a developmental perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.190" end="00:34:30.540" style="s2">relative to the development of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.109" end="00:34:31.770" style="s2">individual and also to their context</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.540" end="00:34:33.300" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean the virtues are</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.770" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">relative it&#39;s this is not a form of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.300" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">relativism it&#39;s it has to do with what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:42.329" style="s2">just talked about that me being virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:44.550" style="s2">in how I&#39;m making sense is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.329" end="00:34:47.819" style="s2">some idiosyncratic specific features</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.550" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">because of my personal Constitution my</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.819" end="00:34:52.230" style="s2">personal past and my personal course of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.149" style="s2">development thank you that was an</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.230" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">excellent question I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.149" end="00:35:00.690" style="s2">that question a lot really made me think</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:35:03.930" style="s2">very deeply here&#39;s another question from</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.690" end="00:35:05.970" style="s2">patron Dan thank you again Dan what role</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.930" end="00:35:07.829" style="s2">does latency mismatch play and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.970" end="00:35:10.109" style="s2">realization and are there any wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.829" end="00:35:16.730" style="s2">practices for slow agents adapting to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.109" end="00:35:20.760" style="s2">fast pace arena so latency mismatch is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.730" end="00:35:22.950" style="s2">let me let me give you an example this</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.760" end="00:35:26.250" style="s2">comes out of a conversation I actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.950" end="00:35:28.200" style="s2">had with Dan and so I appreciate this</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.250" end="00:35:31.710" style="s2">and I want to give him credit but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.200" end="00:35:34.470" style="s2">say let&#39;s talk about the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.710" end="00:35:36.810" style="s2">temporal relevance and timing actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.470" end="00:35:39.450" style="s2">matter to your cognition something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.810" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">Pascal pointed out a long time ago when</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.450" end="00:35:44.430" style="s2">he talked about the spirit of finesse as</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:47.010" style="s2">opposed to the spirit of geometry so for</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.430" end="00:35:52.500" style="s2">example that&#39;s something that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.010" end="00:35:55.650" style="s2">more with sort of neurological</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.500" end="00:35:57.180" style="s2">biological limitations right you know on</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.650" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">how fast you can sort of process thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.180" end="00:36:02.579" style="s2">imagine that you were to take one of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:04.200" style="s2">lectures and play it on you know triple</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.579" end="00:36:07.950" style="s2">speed three times as fast as it normally</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.200" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">is it would be very very hard let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.950" end="00:36:12.869" style="s2">I we get it so you can still hear every</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:15.660" style="s2">word but the the pausing and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.869" end="00:36:18.210" style="s2">know my lectures are already quite dense</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.660" end="00:36:20.910" style="s2">so they would get super dense they would</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.210" end="00:36:24.990" style="s2">get temporally super dense and probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.910" end="00:36:27.500" style="s2">become impenetrable to to you because</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.990" end="00:36:31.500" style="s2">the speed at which your sensory-motor</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.500" end="00:36:34.349" style="s2">loop is looping has a certain timing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.500" end="00:36:38.500" style="s2">it and Dan is pointing to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.349" end="00:36:40.390" style="s2">people have differences in this looping</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.500" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">I think he&#39;s also alluding to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.390" end="00:36:46.810" style="s2">that our the way we&#39;re cyborgs and a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:49.090" style="s2">mess with technology right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.810" end="00:36:51.910" style="s2">exposing ourselves to environments in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.090" end="00:36:55.870" style="s2">which that tempo of things is speeding</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.910" end="00:36:57.850" style="s2">up and Han talks about this wonderfully</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.870" end="00:37:00.130" style="s2">in his book the scent of time and how</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.850" end="00:37:03.010" style="s2">we&#39;re losing the ability to linger and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.130" end="00:37:04.810" style="s2">to and to experience the duration of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.010" end="00:37:06.760" style="s2">things the unfolding of things the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.810" end="00:37:09.570" style="s2">development of things talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.760" end="00:37:13.570" style="s2">earlier if you remember with you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.570" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">the the the the the the death of melody</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.570" end="00:37:21.910" style="s2">within popular music and things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:24.790" style="s2">that and so there&#39;s two things here</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.910" end="00:37:26.890" style="s2">there&#39;s two recommendations first the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.790" end="00:37:31.390" style="s2">one that Han made is we need to remember</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.890" end="00:37:33.490" style="s2">to stop and to move to aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.390" end="00:37:38.350" style="s2">reality that are more in comportment</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.490" end="00:37:41.170" style="s2">with our our for lack of a better term</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.350" end="00:37:43.540" style="s2">our natural you know temporal latency</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.170" end="00:37:45.370" style="s2">and our sensory motor loop and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.540" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">in things like how fast our working</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.370" end="00:37:49.090" style="s2">memory refreshes and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:53.650" style="s2">like that which I won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.090" end="00:37:55.150" style="s2">technical detail so I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:37:57.610" style="s2">could make a good case with that what</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.150" end="00:37:59.830" style="s2">Han is saying is that this is a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.610" end="00:38:01.630" style="s2">our existential mode we move into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.830" end="00:38:04.770" style="s2">spirit of finesse we open up our</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.630" end="00:38:08.100" style="s2">experiencing time so that timing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.770" end="00:38:11.080" style="s2">lingering and the unfoldment of things</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.100" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">is what we&#39;re carrying more about rather</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.080" end="00:38:16.650" style="s2">than again getting towards specific goal</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:19.360" style="s2">states and that that will help with</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:21.930" style="s2">because basically what we need to then</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:24.359" style="s2">think about and I think this is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.930" end="00:40:26.070" style="s2">important recommendation is that in our</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.359" end="00:40:29.190" style="s2">ecology of practices and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.070" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">this in terms of kinds of practices we</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.190" end="00:40:34.290" style="s2">need practices that are designed as</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:37.109" style="s2">transitional practices that are helped</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:38.940" style="s2">designed to get people right more</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.109" end="00:40:41.550" style="s2">appropriately connected obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.940" end="00:40:43.950" style="s2">they&#39;re going to need to train a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.550" end="00:40:45.780" style="s2">the self-deceptive machine a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.950" end="00:40:47.550" style="s2">machinery for overcoming self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.780" end="00:40:50.430" style="s2">because of the way in which the</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.430" end="00:40:55.980" style="s2">and all those things are just awash in</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.830" end="00:40:58.410" style="s2">so much I mean literally the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.980" end="00:40:59.820" style="s2">we&#39;re doing things already beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.410" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">understanding because of the way in</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.820" end="00:41:05.190" style="s2">which the technology and the systems are</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:07.970" style="s2">getting taking taking on a life of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.190" end="00:41:11.609" style="s2">own and running away from us so we need</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.970" end="00:41:15.090" style="s2">to especially train people in that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.609" end="00:41:17.640" style="s2">need to train people to increase the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.090" end="00:41:20.250" style="s2">timing and their finesse for this world</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.640" end="00:41:23.100" style="s2">and that would that we need somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.250" end="00:41:24.420" style="s2">it would be good at sort of to teaching</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.100" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">people you know what&#39;s your consent</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.420" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">mahai talks about about how to get the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:33.300" style="s2">right kind of feedback the right kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.200" style="s2">mean this is something where I&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.580" end="00:41:55.890" style="s2">defer to other people&#39;s expertise I</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.200" end="00:41:58.140" style="s2">could talk about you know what cognition</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.890" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">can do as a cognitive scientist and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.140" end="00:42:03.300" style="s2">invoked some of those processes but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:06.470" style="s2">the specific pedagogical tools that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.300" end="00:42:13.050" style="s2">would be needed in order to get people</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.050" end="00:42:18.540" style="s2">techno sphere that&#39;s that&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.920" end="00:42:22.650" style="s2">think that&#39;s going to require collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.540" end="00:42:24.500" style="s2">intelligence and a network of relevant</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.650" end="00:42:28.680" style="s2">expertise but thank you for that very</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.500" end="00:42:30.900" style="s2">very very good question thank you to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.680" end="00:42:34.650" style="s2">patron subscribers and everyone watching</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:45.380" style="s2">science we&#39;re doing to find solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.990" end="00:42:47.730" style="s2">the main crisis so a reminder about</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.380" end="00:42:49.590" style="s2">after Socrates but I have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.730" end="00:42:53.700" style="s2">announcement to make about after</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.590" end="00:42:56.700" style="s2">Socrates and so this is important I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.700" end="00:43:00.810" style="s2">decided for a couple of reasons that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.700" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">actually going to postpone the release</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.810" end="00:43:04.680" style="s2">of after Socrates to the end of July</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:06.260" style="s2">throughout one of my primary reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.680" end="00:43:10.540" style="s2">doing this is that there are some fun</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.260" end="00:43:14.630" style="s2">any opportunities that have emerged and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.540" end="00:43:16.840" style="s2">and that would help me with fund the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.630" end="00:43:18.950" style="s2">production of the series and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.840" end="00:43:22.730" style="s2">I&#39;m going to pursue these funding</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.950" end="00:43:25.400" style="s2">opportunities so that&#39;s sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.730" end="00:43:30.260" style="s2">economic and logistical reason the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.400" end="00:43:33.650" style="s2">second reason is that I that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.260" end="00:43:35.480" style="s2">project is becoming profound for me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.650" end="00:43:37.550" style="s2">just getting deeper and deeper into it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.480" end="00:43:39.230" style="s2">just doing some really important work</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.749" end="00:46:02.789" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna take a look at movies</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.839" end="00:46:05.729" style="s2">I&#39;ll give sort of a like a 15 minute</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.729" end="00:46:09.749" style="s2">then they&#39;ll be around how you know just</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.219" end="00:46:43.739" style="s2">so that&#39;s all coming out one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.249" end="00:46:47.009" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s currently an IndieGoGo</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.739" end="00:46:48.839" style="s2">campaign for a book that I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.009" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">with Daniel Craig called the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.839" end="00:46:53.249" style="s2">continuum this is a book there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:55.140" style="s2">videos out there that give you a short</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.249" end="00:46:57.420" style="s2">one and if you just want a quick idea a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.140" end="00:47:00.029" style="s2">long one that which Daniel and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.420" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">long discussion the cognitive continuum</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.029" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">is this idea it&#39;s a it&#39;s a line of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.809" style="s2">argumentation that went through after</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:09.569" style="s2">the awakening for the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.809" end="00:47:12.059" style="s2">story and that&#39;s this idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.569" end="00:47:15.319" style="s2">a continuum between the processes of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.059" end="00:47:17.459" style="s2">insight flow mystical experience</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.349" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">enlightenment and trying to work that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.719" end="00:47:28.709" style="s2">out and so I want to state again clearly</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:30.090" style="s2">I do not get any income from this</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.709" end="00:47:32.790" style="s2">IndieGoGo campaign</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.090" end="00:47:36.270" style="s2">nor will I get any income from this book</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.790" end="00:47:39.870" style="s2">the point of raising the funding is to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.270" end="00:47:42.990" style="s2">help Daniel who is not a university</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.870" end="00:47:46.230" style="s2">professor but a you know a student to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.990" end="00:47:48.510" style="s2">help you know fund him so that he can</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.230" end="00:47:50.220" style="s2">devote the time to partner with me in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.510" end="00:47:52.050" style="s2">the writing of this book he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.220" end="00:47:53.370" style="s2">taking a lot of extra tasks that need</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.050" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">funding about putting together the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.370" end="00:48:01.410" style="s2">artwork etc so please consider</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:02.940" style="s2">supporting that IndieGoGo campaign okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.410" end="00:48:07.500" style="s2">we&#39;re going to shift to some live</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.940" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">questions now from the chat and this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.500" end="00:48:12.840" style="s2">from the patreon the golden thread could</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:15.750" style="s2">third order attention ality and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.840" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">imitation be necessary acceptations for</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.750" end="00:48:21.630" style="s2">psycho texts like language numeracy etc</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">is so with the nature function of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.630" end="00:48:35.550" style="s2">mimesis become fundamental for cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:38.010" style="s2">science I think so this did this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.550" end="00:48:39.570" style="s2">tricky because it there&#39;s an issue where</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.010" end="00:48:43.950" style="s2">we might want to think you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.570" end="00:48:46.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve sucked acceptation of course is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.950" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">very important but the imitate I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.830" end="00:48:52.680" style="s2">the imitation is very necessary very</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:54.990" style="s2">much for internalizing other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.680" end="00:48:59.880" style="s2">perspectives and giving us sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.990" end="00:49:04.560" style="s2">second-order cognition like I like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.880" end="00:49:10.200" style="s2">argued in the series I&#39;m trying I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.560" end="00:49:12.270" style="s2">that mimesis the ability to imitate</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.200" end="00:49:14.610" style="s2">other theories again another reason why</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.270" end="00:49:16.350" style="s2">I&#39;m hesitating is because I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.610" end="00:49:19.530" style="s2">doing work right now with Dan Hsia Pia</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.350" end="00:49:23.400" style="s2">and connected to the after Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.530" end="00:49:26.310" style="s2">project about you know the sense of we</p>

<p begin="00:49:26.310" end="00:49:31.350" style="s2">groups like encircling they go from you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.160" end="00:49:32.850" style="s2">know I and you to we and then and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.350" end="00:49:35.550" style="s2">there&#39;s all but there&#39;s even a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.850" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">sort of a third factor above and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.550" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">all the individual participants and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:45.499" style="s2">this relates to mimesis is what you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:47.630" style="s2">is that there there&#39;s stuff happening in</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.499" end="00:49:49.700" style="s2">things like circling in which people</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.630" end="00:49:51.079" style="s2">they&#39;re there there&#39;s a pole there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.700" end="00:49:53.240" style="s2">something like a point of processing a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.079" end="00:49:56.269" style="s2">self-organizing process in which people</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.240" end="00:49:57.529" style="s2">move between mimicry and and in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.269" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">mimicry they&#39;re trying to get sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.529" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">what Durkheim called the mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.970" end="00:50:03.079" style="s2">solidarity which people are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:05.269" style="s2">behaving very much in the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.079" end="00:50:12.339" style="s2">the mimesis is of course therefore</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.269" end="00:50:17.390" style="s2">crucial to engendering that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.339" end="00:50:20.589" style="s2">collective distributed cognition but but</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.390" end="00:50:23.289" style="s2">that is counterbalanced by people doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.589" end="00:50:25.490" style="s2">something else where they enter into</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.289" end="00:50:27.289" style="s2">complementarity where they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.490" end="00:50:31.730" style="s2">mimicking but they&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.289" end="00:50:33.710" style="s2">that complements that&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.730" end="00:50:38.289" style="s2">what sort of like for example of you you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.710" end="00:50:40.460" style="s2">and I are are dancing think about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.289" end="00:50:42.140" style="s2">interplay between mimicry in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.460" end="00:50:44.299" style="s2">doing the same thing and complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.140" end="00:50:45.529" style="s2">where I&#39;m actually doing might be doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.299" end="00:50:46.789" style="s2">the opposite thing you&#39;re stepping</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.529" end="00:50:49.940" style="s2">forward and I&#39;m stepping back for</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.789" end="00:50:53.539" style="s2">example and what you see is people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.940" end="00:50:56.210" style="s2">constantly fluently moving between these</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.539" end="00:50:58.069" style="s2">poles in which they are bound by a kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.210" end="00:50:59.960" style="s2">of mechanical solidarity and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.069" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">they&#39;re bound by a deep interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.960" end="00:51:04.759" style="s2">because each part on its own can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:06.140" style="s2">the function like if you&#39;re lifting a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.759" end="00:51:07.460" style="s2">table and one person has to be walking</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.140" end="00:51:09.559" style="s2">backwards another person has to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.460" end="00:51:13.009" style="s2">walking forward and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.559" end="00:51:15.499" style="s2">constant shift going on there so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.009" end="00:51:15.769" style="s2">why I was hesitating when I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.499" end="00:51:17.900" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.769" end="00:51:20.809" style="s2">mimesis I think mimesis is very</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.900" end="00:51:23.239" style="s2">important as I argued for internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.809" end="00:51:24.950" style="s2">a lot of important psycho tech but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.239" end="00:51:27.799" style="s2">think when we&#39;re going to move to psycho</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.950" end="00:51:32.509" style="s2">tech of dialectic with a psycho psycho</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.799" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">tech that helps to engender and enhance</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.509" end="00:51:37.519" style="s2">deal logos that I talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">then we need we&#39;re going to need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.519" end="00:51:46.420" style="s2">think about mimesis and complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">as forming a much more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.420" end="00:51:52.910" style="s2">opponent processing for how collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:54.050" style="s2">intelligence is operating within</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.050" end="00:51:58.040" style="s2">cognition and you can see why this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.610" end="00:52:03.140" style="s2">really important when trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.040" end="00:52:07.310" style="s2">understand how we can get to do logos so</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.140" end="00:52:09.020" style="s2">I hope that was helpful question I</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.310" end="00:52:12.470" style="s2">really want to get to this next question</p>
