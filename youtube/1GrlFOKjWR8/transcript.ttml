<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">could also be talking about neural</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">hacking for kind of sensory motor no</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:46.530" style="s2">purpose --is or anything that has</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">immune system longevity but when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">about neural hacking in kind of contra</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:57.710" style="s2">distinction to the whole field of bio</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">hacking we&#39;re generally talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.710" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">cognitive and psychomotor all tuning and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">up regulation okay so to the uninitiated</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">what did you just say because it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">very interesting it sounded it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:18.740" style="s2">very complex what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:21.810" style="s2">a nutshell tools for increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.740" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">cognitive capability intelligence focus</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.810" end="00:02:27.180" style="s2">memory etc and for increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">psychological well-being awesome</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.180" end="00:02:32.580" style="s2">okay what is preventing us from just</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.630" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">being naturally gifted in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.580" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">intelligence and and having an optimized</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:42.420" style="s2">today in 2017 as we&#39;re recording this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:44.330" style="s2">that&#39;s preventing us from from you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.420" end="00:02:50.030" style="s2">having that kind of optimum capability</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.330" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">mm-hmm a tremendous amount actually so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.030" end="00:02:56.130" style="s2">we if you look at our interface with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">modern technological built world and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.130" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">look at what our evolutionary biological</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:03.000" style="s2">history is and you look at the places</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">where there&#39;s suboptimal interface</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.000" end="00:03:08.489" style="s2">between those it&#39;s in almost every area</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:10.230" style="s2">so whether it&#39;s eating food that came</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.489" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">from top soil where the agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.230" end="00:03:14.190" style="s2">method had it deficient in</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.190" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">even if you&#39;re eating the healthiest</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">food that you can get access to you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">fundamental nutrient deficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">those are the nutrients that make not</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:26.190" style="s2">only all aspects of physiology function</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">but brain specifically or whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.190" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">looking at the biggest toxicity like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:32.850" style="s2">volatile organic compounds that are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:35.239" style="s2">paint and flooring and so much you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.850" end="00:03:37.019" style="s2">carpet so much interior toxicity or</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.239" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">external environmental toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.019" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">organophosphates bp&#39;s phthalates you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">know most of the organic most of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:49.670" style="s2">toxins that we are exposed to and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">see study after study of breast milk in</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.049" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">neurotoxins they have a real effect and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:04.049" style="s2">then we also have pathogens we never had</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:06.420" style="s2">before because of antibiotic resistance</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.049" end="00:04:10.440" style="s2">because of the amount of global travel</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">things that we can work with but our sub</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:27.800" style="s2">optimal to the human condition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:30.620" style="s2">just on the physio</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.800" end="00:04:32.889" style="s2">oh gee side on the psychology side most</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.620" end="00:04:35.690" style="s2">people don&#39;t have the connection to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.889" end="00:04:37.250" style="s2">tribe that would have been part of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.250" end="00:04:41.180" style="s2">feeling meaningfully connected to other</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.280" end="00:04:50.300" style="s2">come in to and from the macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:53.690" style="s2">system and maybe from other macro global</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.300" end="00:04:55.789" style="s2">issues so all of these are stresses on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.690" end="00:04:57.470" style="s2">our physiology our psychology or nervous</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.789" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">system that are going to have a sub</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:02.840" style="s2">if we don&#39;t work with them mmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.340" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.840" end="00:05:07.159" style="s2">you know the food we eat</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">probably the cleaning products we use in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.159" end="00:05:12.469" style="s2">our kitchen or bathroom staring at a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:14.319" style="s2">screen obviously I talk a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.469" end="00:05:17.479" style="s2">dangers of looking at too much</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.319" end="00:05:19.159" style="s2">electronic light sitting down as well as</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.479" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">a great book called get up by James</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.159" end="00:05:24.110" style="s2">Levine which talks about the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:28.219" style="s2">humans sitting down so much and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.110" end="00:05:29.180" style="s2">that&#39;s affecting us and then I assume</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.219" end="00:05:31.580" style="s2">what you were talking about when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.180" end="00:05:35.270" style="s2">were talking about emotional capability</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.580" end="00:05:38.630" style="s2">was of course Dunbar&#39;s number of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.270" end="00:05:40.279" style="s2">I think was about 150 or 160 people when</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.630" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">we used to be in tribes that was the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.279" end="00:05:45.229" style="s2">number but now it seems like even if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:46.969" style="s2">can if we&#39;re connected to more than that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.229" end="00:05:48.889" style="s2">which would make you feel like you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.969" end="00:05:52.270" style="s2">popular because you connected 250 people</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.889" end="00:05:54.860" style="s2">it seems to suggest that actually you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.270" end="00:05:56.210" style="s2">become less happy the more people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.860" end="00:05:57.469" style="s2">you know the more people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.210" end="00:05:59.599" style="s2">connected to or the more people that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.469" end="00:06:01.099" style="s2">have to keep up with so can we bris</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.599" end="00:06:03.169" style="s2">break down each you want each one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.099" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">these things let&#39;s just look at the food</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.169" end="00:06:09.409" style="s2">we eat for the time being like if I go</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:12.050" style="s2">to Whole Foods down on Fairfax and Santa</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.409" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood here</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.050" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">can I be sure that the foods I&#39;m eating</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:18.680" style="s2">from the salad bar at Whole Foods or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:21.590" style="s2">kale or spinach I&#39;m buying from the in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.680" end="00:06:24.110" style="s2">the plastic bags are going to be okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.590" end="00:06:25.699" style="s2">for me or is what you&#39;re arguing saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.110" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">you know what chances are it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.699" end="00:06:33.889" style="s2">going to be pretty bad for you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">want people to feel hopeless or but</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.889" end="00:06:41.580" style="s2">you&#39;re about to make us feel hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:43.780" style="s2">I mean is buying food that is from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.580" end="00:06:45.340" style="s2">farmers market or someplace that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.780" end="00:06:46.300" style="s2">local fresh are going to be a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.340" end="00:06:49.030" style="s2">than other sources</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.300" end="00:06:51.910" style="s2">yes very likely is buying food that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.030" end="00:06:54.730" style="s2">organic likely to have less pesticide</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.910" end="00:06:58.230" style="s2">residue and maybe more trace mineral yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.730" end="00:07:01.080" style="s2">those were worth doing now even in even</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.230" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">in organic crops well we still find</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.080" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">glyphosate another organophosphate</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:07.510" style="s2">residue just because it&#39;s being sprayed</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.990" end="00:07:10.600" style="s2">nearby yeah we tend up and as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.510" end="00:07:13.330" style="s2">topsoil going to have the microbiota and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.600" end="00:07:15.220" style="s2">trace mineral density of what you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:17.800" style="s2">an indigenous and primitive environment</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.220" end="00:07:19.390" style="s2">would have no so what&#39;s better it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.800" end="00:07:21.700" style="s2">still not ideal</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.390" end="00:07:23.860" style="s2">and people aren&#39;t aren&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.700" end="00:07:25.510" style="s2">eating the variety of foods they would</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.860" end="00:07:27.070" style="s2">in a natural environment that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.510" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">seasonal and that are you know each</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.070" end="00:07:31.660" style="s2">pulling different minerals out of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:33.370" style="s2">soil nair and they are going to have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.660" end="00:07:35.110" style="s2">increased need for certain nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.370" end="00:07:37.330" style="s2">because of toxins and stresses of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.110" end="00:07:39.880" style="s2">processing so what we&#39;re arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.330" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">basically we we don&#39;t have an involved</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.880" end="00:07:44.050" style="s2">process for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:46.210" style="s2">organophosphates or glutathione pathway</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.050" end="00:07:49.450" style="s2">or cytochrome p450 pathway none of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.210" end="00:07:50.830" style="s2">pathways were were evolved for dealing</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.450" end="00:07:52.180" style="s2">with petrochemicals do they weren&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.830" end="00:07:54.010" style="s2">of our evolutionary environment and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.180" end="00:07:57.130" style="s2">given that we have the exposure to those</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.010" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">things it&#39;s actually important and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.130" end="00:08:03.100" style="s2">beneficial to support our system to deal</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:05.169" style="s2">with the world that happens to be in so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.100" end="00:08:06.730" style="s2">how do we ensure that we&#39;re eating the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.169" end="00:08:11.250" style="s2">best quality foods and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.730" end="00:08:11.250" style="s2">practical way that we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.360" end="00:08:21.250" style="s2">outside of someone foraging or having a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.940" end="00:08:25.870" style="s2">garden where they can really ensure that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.250" end="00:08:27.669" style="s2">themselves I would say farmers markets</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.870" end="00:08:29.350" style="s2">are great because it&#39;s someone else</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.669" end="00:08:30.700" style="s2">having a garden where you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.350" end="00:08:33.729" style="s2">about the farmer learn about their</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.700" end="00:08:35.860" style="s2">methods find one like well likely you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.729" end="00:08:38.589" style="s2">can get something there that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.860" end="00:08:41.830" style="s2">less hours since it was harvested than</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.589" end="00:08:45.310" style="s2">at a grocery store and outside of where</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.830" end="00:08:47.770" style="s2">that&#39;s viable then going to local coops</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.310" end="00:08:49.810" style="s2">and local health food stores is going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.770" end="00:08:51.980" style="s2">be probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.810" end="00:08:53.630" style="s2">usually viable option and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.980" end="00:08:55.070" style="s2">understanding the different things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.630" end="00:08:56.269" style="s2">are in there which is that not</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.070" end="00:08:57.709" style="s2">everything in a health food store is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.269" end="00:08:59.269" style="s2">actually healthy and not everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.709" end="00:09:01.370" style="s2">that&#39;s healthy for one person is for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.269" end="00:09:03.829" style="s2">someone else and is there one question</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.370" end="00:09:05.510" style="s2">that we should ask our farmer at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.829" end="00:09:06.950" style="s2">farmers market when we&#39;re about to buy</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:08.570" style="s2">the kale or the spinach or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.950" end="00:09:10.370" style="s2">strawberries of the bananas or the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.570" end="00:09:12.230" style="s2">or whatever we&#39;re about to buy is there</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.370" end="00:09:14.899" style="s2">one question we should be asking and one</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.230" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">answer we should be looking for to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.899" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">ensure that we&#39;re giving ourselves the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:22.550" style="s2">best opportunity to get the healthiest</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:24.200" style="s2">food we possibly can well you might have</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.550" end="00:09:26.300" style="s2">one question being that you framed it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.200" end="00:09:29.060" style="s2">that way which I&#39;d love to hear I I</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.300" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">would generally ask what what are their</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.060" end="00:09:33.560" style="s2">growing processes and premises so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:36.079" style="s2">want to get into how they enrich the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.560" end="00:09:38.510" style="s2">soil what kind of you know do they use</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.079" end="00:09:42.380" style="s2">rock flowers do they use different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.510" end="00:09:45.320" style="s2">of micro Rosia and you know Soylent</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.380" end="00:09:47.480" style="s2">enrichments pesticides proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.320" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">other pesticides how long from when</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.480" end="00:09:52.100" style="s2">they&#39;re harvested to get in obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:53.329" style="s2">the more one knows about anything the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.100" end="00:09:55.970" style="s2">better they can do to navigate that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.329" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">space okay we&#39;re talking to Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.970" end="00:09:59.930" style="s2">schmuck Tim burger who&#39;s the co-founder</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:03.019" style="s2">of neuro hacker collective we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.930" end="00:10:04.550" style="s2">to talk to him a little bit about a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.019" end="00:10:07.310" style="s2">product that he has as well that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.550" end="00:10:10.100" style="s2">to help you with your with your brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.310" end="00:10:13.430" style="s2">and give you brain nutrients I had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.100" end="00:10:16.029" style="s2">yeah a cleaner come to my home just the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.430" end="00:10:18.199" style="s2">other day here in Los Angeles Daniel and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.029" end="00:10:21.290" style="s2">she was complaining that I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.199" end="00:10:22.940" style="s2">enough products in my in my apartment</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.290" end="00:10:25.970" style="s2">for her to be able to clean with she</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.940" end="00:10:28.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t bring her own products she she</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.970" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">you know came and was reliant on me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.010" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">she asked me for next time that she came</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.140" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">to buy products the name of which</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:36.680" style="s2">escapes me I think it was Clorox or</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:42.620" style="s2">something like that and it was clearly</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.680" end="00:10:45.740" style="s2">like a bad chemical what product should</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.620" end="00:10:47.779" style="s2">I be buying to clean my home or to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.740" end="00:10:49.130" style="s2">available like what what kind of natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.779" end="00:10:50.779" style="s2">products because it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.130" end="00:10:52.459" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like oh yeah I get this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.779" end="00:10:55.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like these vicious chemicals which</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.459" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">are doing this it seemed like permanent</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.250" end="00:11:02.550" style="s2">damage to our brains just for a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.520" end="00:11:04.769" style="s2">bit of context ammonia</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.550" end="00:11:10.380" style="s2">an amazing beautiful chemical right</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.769" end="00:11:12.300" style="s2">chlorine is a beautiful molecule all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.380" end="00:11:15.019" style="s2">the chemicals that we have developed I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.300" end="00:11:17.250" style="s2">mean DDT is a fascinating chemical right</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.019" end="00:11:21.029" style="s2">and so the better living through</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.250" end="00:11:22.860" style="s2">chemistry the problem was that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.029" end="00:11:24.750" style="s2">understand complex systems we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.860" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">understand whole systems and so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.750" end="00:11:28.380" style="s2">understood one very narrow part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:29.700" style="s2">system we developed something that would</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.380" end="00:11:31.620" style="s2">be good for that part of the system but</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.700" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">it had other effects those other effects</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.620" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">were called externalities we&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">to understand those externalities and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:37.800" style="s2">realize the problem of the externalities</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:39.690" style="s2">on both the environment and our</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.800" end="00:11:40.740" style="s2">physiology so you know most of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.690" end="00:11:42.089" style="s2">Pharma meds are actually really</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.740" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">fascinating chemicals for the one</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.089" end="00:11:45.240" style="s2">pathway they&#39;re affecting it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:48.990" style="s2">they affect other stuff which is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:53.160" style="s2">problematic so it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.990" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2">that late your ammonia or lime away</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.160" end="00:11:58.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have some application where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.980" end="00:12:00.810" style="s2">possibly beneficial but we do want to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.410" end="00:12:02.940" style="s2">conscientious of the fact that the those</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.810" end="00:12:04.620" style="s2">chemicals have effects on biology that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.940" end="00:12:06.690" style="s2">even breathing them have effects on</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.620" end="00:12:08.370" style="s2">biology after the fact and those are</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.690" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not effects on biology that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.370" end="00:12:12.750" style="s2">want to have unconsciously so you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">companies like seventh generation and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.750" end="00:12:16.170" style="s2">Heather&#39;s and things that people can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">even in the grocery store that are more</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.170" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">eco friendly both from their effect on</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.180" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">the environment and their effect on</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">humans in the environment where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:27.300" style="s2">clean and then you have some companies</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:30.779" style="s2">that make really kind of high-tech</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.300" end="00:12:32.490" style="s2">things with a high tech nature tech</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.779" end="00:12:34.230" style="s2">cleaning products that can be very</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.490" end="00:12:37.620" style="s2">effective with different essential oils</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.230" end="00:12:40.709" style="s2">and saponified natural fatty acids and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.620" end="00:12:42.570" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;m not I&#39;m not affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.709" end="00:12:44.700" style="s2">any of the companies I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.570" end="00:12:46.770" style="s2">mention but seventh generation certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.700" end="00:12:47.940" style="s2">I have a couple of those products and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.770" end="00:12:50.250" style="s2">I&#39;m glad that you said that because it</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.250" end="00:12:55.140" style="s2">then there&#39;s honest the honest company</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">which is the company created by the</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:03.149" style="s2">you familiar with their products so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.290" end="00:13:05.010" style="s2">honest company products healthy as</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.149" end="00:13:08.940" style="s2">healthy as I can get as well Daniel I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.010" end="00:13:10.350" style="s2">have seen them and heard good things</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.940" end="00:13:12.930" style="s2">about them but I can&#39;t speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.350" end="00:13:15.029" style="s2">chemistry okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.930" end="00:13:16.080" style="s2">you mentioned global travel how is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.029" end="00:13:21.240" style="s2">global travel</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.080" end="00:13:22.650" style="s2">affecting our nervous system lots of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.240" end="00:13:24.750" style="s2">things I was speaking from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.650" end="00:13:27.210" style="s2">view of pathogens which was before we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.750" end="00:13:28.740" style="s2">had global travel we had the pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.210" end="00:13:30.770" style="s2">that would have been within a bio region</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.740" end="00:13:33.990" style="s2">there would have been things that we had</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.770" end="00:13:37.140" style="s2">evolved immune system and microbiome to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.990" end="00:13:38.940" style="s2">deal with well and when we travel we had</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.140" end="00:13:41.370" style="s2">the possibility exposed to a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.940" end="00:13:43.050" style="s2">pathogens that we don&#39;t have innate</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.370" end="00:13:44.400" style="s2">immunity to deal with and so there&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.050" end="00:13:45.960" style="s2">course beautiful things about our</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.400" end="00:13:47.430" style="s2">ability to travel and get exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.960" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">other ways of looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.430" end="00:13:53.070" style="s2">you know people world views but there</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">are there are other effects of that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.070" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">we have to be conscientious of and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">the answer of just more vaccines for</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:03.990" style="s2">every place you go also has consequences</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:05.550" style="s2">and so just these are if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.990" end="00:14:07.590" style="s2">system that&#39;s going to be exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.550" end="00:14:09.240" style="s2">more pathogens and pathogens that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.590" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t evolve to deal with in recent</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.240" end="00:14:12.750" style="s2">history well then again we just say</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.610" end="00:14:14.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a place where we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.750" end="00:14:15.870" style="s2">more immune system support just like</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.490" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">we&#39;d want to have more detox system</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.870" end="00:14:20.340" style="s2">support if were exposed to more reminyl</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:21.540" style="s2">toxins let&#39;s find a lot just a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.340" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">other problems and then we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.540" end="00:14:28.730" style="s2">some possible solutions here staring at</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:33.300" style="s2">a screen what are the problems with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.730" end="00:14:36.120" style="s2">well beyond the backlighting and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.300" end="00:14:37.620" style="s2">lumens and the specific kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.120" end="00:14:39.480" style="s2">kelvins the specific kind of spectral</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:41.490" style="s2">frequencies of light that I imagine your</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.480" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">listeners all understand quite well a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.490" end="00:14:46.290" style="s2">few other things that can be problematic</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:48.750" style="s2">about it is that it&#39;s a fixed focal</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.290" end="00:14:52.080" style="s2">length and so if I&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.750" end="00:14:54.780" style="s2">computer that is 12 inches or 18 however</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.080" end="00:14:56.250" style="s2">many inches from my face then the focal</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.780" end="00:14:58.920" style="s2">length of my eyes for being able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.250" end="00:15:00.060" style="s2">focus very close and very far is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.920" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">getting engaged and those are muscles</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.060" end="00:15:04.530" style="s2">and in an evolutionary environment we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">would have been not looking at a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.530" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">fixed focal length for all that much</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.660" style="s2">time right we&#39;ve been looking further</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">often seeing trees up close in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.660" end="00:15:15.210" style="s2">process of that dynamic movement of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:17.310" style="s2">eye musculature to be able to focus near</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.210" end="00:15:20.010" style="s2">and far as part of what helps keep that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.310" end="00:15:22.350" style="s2">musculature healthy and prevent the kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.010" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">of vision loss that we consider so</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.350" end="00:15:25.710" style="s2">natural with age it happened before</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:27.240" style="s2">computer screens and books for us but</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.710" end="00:15:29.190" style="s2">fixed focal ink for very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.240" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">time there&#39;s an easy solution for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.190" end="00:15:32.370" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:33.990" style="s2">every 15 minutes half an hour that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.370" end="00:15:35.550" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at a book or screen just</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.990" end="00:15:37.230" style="s2">look far away you know and let your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.550" end="00:15:39.150" style="s2">focus look at something very close that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.230" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">your eyes focus so muscular stays</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.150" end="00:15:45.390" style="s2">engaged there&#39;s also a postural effect</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:47.250" style="s2">of if I&#39;m looking at a screen if it</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.390" end="00:15:49.980" style="s2">involves me not moving very much then of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.250" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">course we have all of the neurological</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.980" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2">myofascial affects of just being very</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:55.770" style="s2">sedentary but if the posture if the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:57.300" style="s2">ergonomics themselves have been looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.770" end="00:15:59.790" style="s2">down and taking the s-curve out of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.300" end="00:16:01.410" style="s2">cervical spine the secret of my cervical</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.790" end="00:16:04.040" style="s2">spine you know then I&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.410" end="00:16:06.540" style="s2">dealing with those postural effects so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:09.480" style="s2">computers are awesome International</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.540" end="00:16:11.520" style="s2">Travel is awesome and to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.480" end="00:16:13.020" style="s2">we&#39;re interfacing with it for one set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.520" end="00:16:14.280" style="s2">reasons but it&#39;s having other effects we</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.020" end="00:16:17.730" style="s2">just want to understand those effects</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.280" end="00:16:20.640" style="s2">and know how to augment any possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.730" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">negatives because I got a lifespan</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:28.980" style="s2">not actually walking on it at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.890" end="00:16:31.020" style="s2">that I I now for the most part work at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.980" end="00:16:32.850" style="s2">computer standing up and initially I</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.020" end="00:16:35.820" style="s2">thought I was so clever but then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.850" end="00:16:38.520" style="s2">realized that I didn&#39;t have a computer</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.820" end="00:16:40.650" style="s2">stand on my desk so my computer was</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.520" end="00:16:43.980" style="s2">actually down at kind of chest level and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.650" end="00:16:46.020" style="s2">so my head was kind of you know aiming</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.980" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">down a little bit rather rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.020" end="00:16:49.170" style="s2">straight so here I was the months going</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:51.900" style="s2">I&#39;m so clever I&#39;m on a treadmill desk</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.170" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">I&#39;m standing up look at me and then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.900" end="00:16:56.100" style="s2">was like oh actually hang on a second my</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:58.740" style="s2">spine is probably still slouching over</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.100" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">because I&#39;m looking down so now I have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.740" end="00:17:03.780" style="s2">stand and stand my computer on my laptop</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:05.940" style="s2">sits on top that&#39;s down and as you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.780" end="00:17:09.420" style="s2">see I&#39;m talking to you now Daniel my</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.940" end="00:17:12.120" style="s2">eyes are at my head and my posture is</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.290" end="00:17:37.470" style="s2">when they&#39;re traveling is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.430" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">hard at least understanding the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.470" end="00:17:41.820" style="s2">or one can counterbalance them but for</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:43.380" style="s2">most people the ergonomics that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.820" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">going to be important is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.380" end="00:17:49.080" style="s2">if you&#39;re looking straight ahead meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:51.210" style="s2">not down and not up you would like to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.080" end="00:17:52.470" style="s2">looking slightly up from there if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.210" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">going to be in one place for a long</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.470" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">period of time so that the natural C</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:58.290" style="s2">curve in the cervical spine is being</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">supported rather than otherwise so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.290" end="00:18:02.790" style="s2">we&#39;re generally looking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.720" style="s2">down then we end up getting the muscles</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.790" end="00:18:05.160" style="s2">in the back of the neck and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.720" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">suboccipital muscles getting tight</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.160" end="00:18:10.290" style="s2">causing all of the kind of dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:12.330" style="s2">come from that and so if someone puts</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.290" end="00:18:13.770" style="s2">their monitor higher than they normally</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.330" end="00:18:17.730" style="s2">would where the center point of their</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.770" end="00:18:19.920" style="s2">monitor is around eye level and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.730" end="00:18:21.780" style="s2">they usually want their keyboard low and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.920" end="00:18:24.660" style="s2">we can get into ergonomic keyboards so</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.780" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">that the shoulders aren&#39;t up at that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.660" end="00:18:30.090" style="s2">generally keyboard low monitor high is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">kind of first rule of thumb I love it</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.090" end="00:18:34.890" style="s2">well I&#39;m now you&#39;ve inspired me to put</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:36.690" style="s2">my computer up even higher now so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.890" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">going to make sure I do that when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.690" end="00:18:40.620" style="s2">when we finish this interview thank you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:43.380" style="s2">for that for the tip there two more</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.119" end="00:23:07.929" style="s2">it possible that 1020 years or two years</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.649" end="00:23:13.570" style="s2">or whatever we&#39;re going to realize that</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:18.340" style="s2">damaging to us as we now know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.580" end="00:23:19.989" style="s2">smoking is is to us for years nobody</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.340" end="00:23:21.309" style="s2">realized nobody thought that smoking was</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.989" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">bad for you and then all of a sudden in</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.309" end="00:23:26.169" style="s2">the 50s and 60s it started to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:27.249" style="s2">catch on or actually we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.169" end="00:23:31.210" style="s2">see some correlation here between</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.249" end="00:23:35.889" style="s2">smoking and being unfair and heart</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.210" end="00:23:37.720" style="s2">disease is it possible that one day not</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.720" end="00:23:41.710" style="s2">we&#39;re going to wake up and go damn I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.789" end="00:23:43.659" style="s2">cannot believe we were using the Wi-Fi</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.710" end="00:23:45.720" style="s2">can&#39;t believe we&#39;re using cellphones we</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.720" end="00:23:52.899" style="s2">entirely possible damn I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.659" end="00:23:55.929" style="s2">it is probable that we will realize some</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.899" end="00:23:57.820" style="s2">effects that seem unacceptable to us</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.929" end="00:23:59.580" style="s2">with I&#39;m not quantifying how much</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.820" end="00:24:02.739" style="s2">compared to cigarettes but some of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.580" end="00:24:06.359" style="s2">now cigarettes are pretty easy which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.739" end="00:24:08.710" style="s2">we just don&#39;t actually need them right</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.359" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">Wi-Fi and just wireless energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.710" end="00:24:11.830" style="s2">transmission and not just wireless but</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.190" style="s2">energy transmission in general we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:17.139" style="s2">just not going to go backwards from that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.190" end="00:24:18.680" style="s2">so I think one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.139" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">going to happen is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.680" end="00:24:22.610" style="s2">start realizing that just like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:23.660" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to stop having cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.610" end="00:24:25.880" style="s2">products we&#39;re a make better cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.660" end="00:24:27.470" style="s2">products where we pay attention to how</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.470" end="00:24:30.860" style="s2">actually interface with biology I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.690" end="00:24:32.810" style="s2">we&#39;re going to start paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.860" end="00:24:36.860" style="s2">understanding bio signals better and</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.580" end="00:25:40.750" style="s2">affecting affecting us so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">primatologist Dunbar took an observation</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.750" end="00:25:44.750" style="s2">many people have had previously which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">that most indigenous tribes capped out</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:49.430" style="s2">at around 150 people give or take maxed</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.680" style="s2">out around 225 in a few cases but</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.430" end="00:25:54.280" style="s2">generate hundred 50 and then if they got</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.680" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">bigger than that they would bifurcate or</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.280" end="00:25:58.550" style="s2">intentionally limit their size and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a question as to why and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.550" end="00:26:01.460" style="s2">found that there was a similar thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:03.950" style="s2">that happened in all kinds of primates</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.460" end="00:26:05.710" style="s2">and that the size of the troop they</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.950" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">could hold was actually proportional to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.710" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">neocortical volume and the idea was that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:13.010" style="s2">we actually have a limited number of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:16.580" style="s2">unique relationships we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.010" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">process well and so when we&#39;ve got about</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.580" end="00:26:20.780" style="s2">150 people you can actually know</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.980" end="00:26:22.280" style="s2">everybody in that village well know</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.780" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">their lives their history what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.280" end="00:26:27.500" style="s2">on and that works if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:29.720" style="s2">have a village where everyone is going</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.500" end="00:26:31.700" style="s2">to impact everyone knowing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.720" end="00:26:32.440" style="s2">caring about everybody being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.700" end="00:26:34.420" style="s2">in real time</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.440" end="00:26:36.700" style="s2">effect on them is part of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.420" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">social cohesion works as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.700" end="00:26:41.080" style="s2">start having enough people that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:42.970" style="s2">actually can&#39;t track everybody then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.080" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">start having anonymous people and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.970" end="00:26:45.850" style="s2">start having people where if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:47.800" style="s2">suffering you don&#39;t kind of care as much</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.850" end="00:26:49.180" style="s2">and then you can have effects that could</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.800" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">lead to them suffering but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.180" end="00:26:52.990" style="s2">care as much you can&#39;t have social</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:55.150" style="s2">cohesion in the same way now obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.990" end="00:26:58.510" style="s2">we are not going to move back to a world</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.150" end="00:27:00.700" style="s2">of just Dunbar number tribes because you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.510" end="00:27:02.680" style="s2">also then have to have technology that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.700" end="00:27:04.180" style="s2">only you know is back to the technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.680" end="00:27:05.950" style="s2">of that time where you&#39;re only affecting</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.180" end="00:27:07.750" style="s2">that number of people and obviously our</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.950" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">technology extends our impact to now</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.750" end="00:27:11.920" style="s2">global there&#39;s and there&#39;s actually what</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">we can think of that was the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.920" end="00:27:16.180" style="s2">insight there&#39;s multiple Dunbar numbers</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:18.610" style="s2">which is numbers where different social</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.180" end="00:27:22.120" style="s2">dynamics occur one on one is the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.610" end="00:27:25.660" style="s2">right then small groups three four then</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.120" end="00:27:27.940" style="s2">up to about 12 or 15 etc so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.660" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">not a problem how many people you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.940" end="00:27:32.410" style="s2">been exposed to or how many people you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:35.590" style="s2">have friends on Facebook it there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.410" end="00:27:38.290" style="s2">need to have some deep meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.590" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">interactions with some number of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.290" end="00:27:41.110" style="s2">which will probably be less than your</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:42.940" style="s2">total number of friends on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.110" end="00:27:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s important to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.940" end="00:27:46.570" style="s2">difference of in-person deep meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.040" end="00:27:48.040" style="s2">human interactions where you deeply know</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.570" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">them they deeply know you and you can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.040" end="00:27:51.430" style="s2">authentic with each other then the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:53.430" style="s2">of interactions that are mediated by</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.430" end="00:27:58.090" style="s2">so stop focusing on trying to get a</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.090" end="00:28:02.800" style="s2">Facebook Likes and start really going in</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.340" end="00:28:05.020" style="s2">and and and concentrating on the quality</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.800" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">of relationships rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.020" end="00:28:12.070" style="s2">quantity it&#39;s in I really want to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:13.900" style="s2">I&#39;m a technologist hmm I am just about</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.070" end="00:28:15.700" style="s2">right use of technology understanding</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.900" end="00:28:17.020" style="s2">all of the effects of it I have nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.700" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">wrong with someone getting a hundred</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:54.570" style="s2">here so to the degree that there are key</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.580" end="00:29:57.179" style="s2">nutrients so when people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.570" end="00:30:00.990" style="s2">about the effects of minerals like</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.179" end="00:30:03.649" style="s2">magnesium or lithium or zinc or etc on</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.990" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">brain function or vitamin D or</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.149" end="00:30:16.169" style="s2">because again like we said it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.250" end="00:30:17.730" style="s2">hard to get adequate amounts of those in</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.169" end="00:30:19.559" style="s2">a healthy diet and we have increased</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.020" end="00:31:51.090" style="s2">definitions they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.289" end="00:31:53.190" style="s2">slang terms but I&#39;m going to give you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.090" end="00:31:55.770" style="s2">the best general definitions smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.190" end="00:31:58.230" style="s2">are usually pharmaceuticals that have</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.770" end="00:32:01.820" style="s2">some cognitive benefit generally for</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.820" end="00:32:08.780" style="s2">psychiatric meds like a DD or Ritalin or</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.429" end="00:32:13.260" style="s2">wellbutrin or narcolepsy meds like</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.549" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">increase you know something smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.490" end="00:32:31.320" style="s2">can enhance some aspects of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:32.760" style="s2">function that someone wants experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.320" end="00:32:34.380" style="s2">and you know hypothetically this could</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.760" end="00:32:35.400" style="s2">be not just Pharma drugs but any drug</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.380" end="00:32:36.299" style="s2">you could put Kourt rayon or</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.299" end="00:32:40.590" style="s2">other drugs into those categories where</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.590" end="00:32:45.750" style="s2">like dopamine in a way that will have</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.419" end="00:32:49.049" style="s2">some cognitive effect but usually with</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.750" end="00:32:51.480" style="s2">some meaningful side-effects immediate</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.049" end="00:32:54.750" style="s2">side-effects like they might up regulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.480" end="00:32:57.230" style="s2">focus but increase anxiety or paranoia</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.750" end="00:32:59.970" style="s2">or irritability or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.230" end="00:33:01.740" style="s2">and they might also have long-term side</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.909" end="00:33:09.270" style="s2">dependence right addiction forming</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.770" end="00:33:12.090" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.270" end="00:33:14.580" style="s2">they&#39;re taking something like dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.090" end="00:33:16.620" style="s2">or acetylcholine or glutamate or some no</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.580" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">transmitter usually that your body</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.899" end="00:33:36.659" style="s2">addiction no tropics the goal with no</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.159" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">tropics and it&#39;s why it&#39;s like kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">there are some chemistry&#39;s that can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:47.159" style="s2">added to the system that can enhance</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:49.320" style="s2">some aspect of function without creating</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.320" end="00:33:55.250" style="s2">effects so of all so obviously the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.490" end="00:33:57.690" style="s2">that you&#39;re describing it nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.250" end="00:34:00.299" style="s2">improves your cognitive function above</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.440" end="00:34:09.419" style="s2">take your explanation is are can also</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.529" end="00:34:11.190" style="s2">improve cognitive effect and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.419" end="00:34:13.290" style="s2">good things like a DD and Alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.190" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">but they come with problems they come</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.290" end="00:34:17.070" style="s2">with potential short and long term</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">effects and I think there was a third</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.070" end="00:34:21.030" style="s2">one their brain nutrients right I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:23.490" style="s2">you broke it into can just explain brain</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.030" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">nutrients again as opposed as that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.490" end="00:34:27.740" style="s2">different from the smart drugs and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">no topics essential fatty acids</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.740" end="00:34:33.300" style="s2">essential amino acids vitamins minerals</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.550" style="s2">antioxidants the things that you would</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.300" end="00:34:37.139" style="s2">normally get from food that either</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.550" end="00:34:39.389" style="s2">you&#39;re not getting enough of from food</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.139" end="00:34:44.369" style="s2">or that it&#39;s beneficial to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.389" end="00:34:46.200" style="s2">additional amounts of based on what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.369" end="00:34:48.089" style="s2">know what we&#39;re exposed to how much</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.200" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">we&#39;re actually using our brains and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.089" end="00:34:53.700" style="s2">cognitive load so these are basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:55.349" style="s2">brain nutrients are either going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.700" end="00:34:56.909" style="s2">things that could be found in food or</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.349" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">things that could be found endogenously</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.909" end="00:35:01.830" style="s2">in the body that the body would make</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:03.720" style="s2">from food gotcha okay so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.830" end="00:35:06.089" style="s2">obviously a proponent of no tropics of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.720" end="00:35:08.520" style="s2">all those three correct and brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.089" end="00:35:09.050" style="s2">nutrients but not so much with the smart</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.520" end="00:35:11.460" style="s2">drugs</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.050" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">well again like I said bleach has a</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.460" end="00:35:20.339" style="s2">right application man any drug can have</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:21.310" style="s2">a right application but in general there</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.339" end="00:35:24.100" style="s2">is such a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.310" end="00:35:28.150" style="s2">there is such a profound complexity to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.100" end="00:35:29.470" style="s2">how human physiology works and complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.150" end="00:35:33.130" style="s2">means something different than</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.470" end="00:35:35.290" style="s2">complicated the circuit chip is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.130" end="00:35:36.940" style="s2">complicated it was designed externally</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.290" end="00:35:39.400" style="s2">you put a certain number of transistors</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.940" end="00:35:41.410" style="s2">linked one particular way a cell is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.400" end="00:35:43.900" style="s2">complex it&#39;s self-organizing its</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.410" end="00:35:47.140" style="s2">boundary is non arbitrary complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.900" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">systems behave in fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.140" end="00:35:54.310" style="s2">different in it and more organizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:55.810" style="s2">dynamic kind of ways in complicated</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.310" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">systems so when we look at human</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.810" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">physiology and especially the brain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:03.220" style="s2">such a radically complex self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:05.410" style="s2">a dynamic homeostatic system that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.220" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want to override that right so if</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.410" end="00:36:12.940" style="s2">someone&#39;s dopamine is low our goal isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:14.890" style="s2">to just give them insane dopamine or a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.940" end="00:36:17.830" style="s2">dopamine agonist it would be safe to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.890" end="00:36:19.960" style="s2">well let&#39;s see if we can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.830" end="00:36:22.980" style="s2">dopaminergic system better and see how</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.960" end="00:36:26.620" style="s2">to support that systems endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.980" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">regulatory capacity so that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.620" end="00:36:30.670" style="s2">intervention that we&#39;re doing actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:33.070" style="s2">leads to lasting up regulation rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.670" end="00:36:35.830" style="s2">than short-term stimulus and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.070" end="00:36:38.770" style="s2">lasting down regulation so in general</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.830" end="00:36:41.500" style="s2">for all kinds of inputs to biology I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.770" end="00:36:43.960" style="s2">interested in things that understand and</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:52.450" style="s2">think of it usually is not for curing</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.950" end="00:39:26.350" style="s2">created your own products called qualia</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.980" end="00:39:29.470" style="s2">qu al I a and I&#39;m presuming this is an O</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.350" end="00:39:31.810" style="s2">tropic right yes so tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.470" end="00:39:33.550" style="s2">about what this is like what so tell us</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.810" end="00:39:34.990" style="s2">a little bit about why qualia is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.550" end="00:39:37.240" style="s2">little different and what typical</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.990" end="00:39:40.660" style="s2">experiences people might have if they</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.240" end="00:39:41.830" style="s2">take this product that you&#39;ve created so</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.660" end="00:39:43.660" style="s2">like I said we&#39;re working in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.830" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">different areas of technology quality is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.660" end="00:39:47.290" style="s2">the first product that we have brought</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:48.120" style="s2">to market we have quite a few other</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.290" end="00:39:49.470" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.120" end="00:39:52.020" style="s2">trials that will be coming to market</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.470" end="00:39:53.580" style="s2">this year and then some relatively</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.020" end="00:39:57.270" style="s2">difficult ones it will take a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.580" end="00:40:01.950" style="s2">longer but are developing well the goal</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.270" end="00:40:03.930" style="s2">with qualia was when we look at the give</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.950" end="00:40:06.510" style="s2">or take 15 billion dollars a year</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.930" end="00:40:09.360" style="s2">domestically in energy drinks and how</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.510" end="00:40:11.340" style="s2">much kind of caffeine stimulus happens</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.360" end="00:40:13.170" style="s2">and if we look at the estimated</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.340" end="00:40:16.530" style="s2">something like 5 billion dollars an</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.170" end="00:40:18.330" style="s2">off-label adderall use not justified</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.530" end="00:40:19.890" style="s2">doctor adderall use which we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.330" end="00:40:22.110" style="s2">question if is ever a good thing but</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.890" end="00:40:23.880" style="s2">just people who are their midterms or</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.110" end="00:40:27.390" style="s2">finals or tech startup whatever seeking</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.880" end="00:40:29.460" style="s2">that kind of enhancement because there</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.390" end="00:40:32.280" style="s2">is a increased demand for productivity</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.460" end="00:40:33.750" style="s2">and cognitive productivity beyond what</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.280" end="00:40:35.670" style="s2">there&#39;s ever been well having more</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.750" end="00:40:37.770" style="s2">things trying to distract from focus and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.670" end="00:40:41.220" style="s2">you know also stresses on the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.770" end="00:40:43.890" style="s2">system like we&#39;ve talked about the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.220" end="00:40:47.550" style="s2">about adderall and other smart drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.890" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">just tons of caffeine is that while</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.550" end="00:40:52.470" style="s2">they can positively affect some metrics</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">which is why people use them many of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.470" end="00:40:55.500" style="s2">other metrics that are critical are</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">actually being down regulated in real</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.500" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">time so we can see for most people when</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:03.840" style="s2">they&#39;re taking adderall that their focus</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:05.910" style="s2">will go up their drive will go up but</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.840" end="00:41:08.310" style="s2">certain aspects of creative thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.910" end="00:41:10.830" style="s2">systemic thinking and even aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.310" end="00:41:12.450" style="s2">memory go down let alone emotional</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.830" end="00:41:14.010" style="s2">things like empathy going down and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.450" end="00:41:16.200" style="s2">long-term health effects so we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.010" end="00:41:18.870" style="s2">see can we develop something that would</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.200" end="00:41:20.910" style="s2">meet the same need people&#39;s desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.870" end="00:41:22.170" style="s2">able to go into creative productive flow</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.910" end="00:41:26.970" style="s2">states where their full cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.170" end="00:41:29.640" style="s2">capabilities were available can we do</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.970" end="00:41:35.010" style="s2">that more comprehensively than has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.640" end="00:41:37.260" style="s2">done so far and more safely and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.010" end="00:41:38.580" style="s2">started by doing this in integrative</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.260" end="00:41:40.170" style="s2">clinical settings where we were running</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.580" end="00:41:41.970" style="s2">people&#39;s whole genome we were running a</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.170" end="00:41:43.620" style="s2">lot of clinical chemistry were running</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.970" end="00:41:46.050" style="s2">brain scans were giving medical history</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.620" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">and we were really dialing in custom</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.050" end="00:41:51.030" style="s2">personalized chemistry for people then</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">the question was could we take some</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.030" end="00:41:56.190" style="s2">elements of that that would work across</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:58.110" style="s2">a bell curve of people and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.190" end="00:42:00.120" style="s2">meaningfully be able to affect them</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.110" end="00:42:01.950" style="s2">because personalized chemistry at scale</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.120" end="00:42:04.320" style="s2">is tricky we&#39;re work</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.950" end="00:42:06.599" style="s2">we&#39;re actually working on moving from</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.320" end="00:42:08.750" style="s2">the one version of qualia to multiple</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.599" end="00:42:13.490" style="s2">versions in the future all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.750" end="00:42:17.099" style="s2">you know lab based fully customized</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.490" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">chemistry pharmacology but we were</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.099" end="00:42:20.430" style="s2">really surprised at how well we were</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:22.770" style="s2">able to do taking a systems approach to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.430" end="00:42:24.510" style="s2">no traffic swear we were you know we</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.770" end="00:42:27.840" style="s2">started out by modeling when people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.510" end="00:42:29.220" style="s2">taking some smart drug or something to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.840" end="00:42:31.290" style="s2">that effect what are they really seeking</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.220" end="00:42:34.470" style="s2">and we did kind of a cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.290" end="00:42:36.690" style="s2">of their they&#39;re seeking increased</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.470" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">short-term memory and long-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.690" end="00:42:41.810" style="s2">and speed of memory and digit span and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:44.550" style="s2">verbal fluency and task switching and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.810" end="00:42:47.430" style="s2">creative thinking and critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.550" end="00:42:49.170" style="s2">you know analysis and synthesis and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:51.990" style="s2">bunch of emotional things like emotional</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.170" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">resilience and drive and you know so we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.990" end="00:42:55.619" style="s2">were looking at that whole set of things</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">together and then saying alright we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.619" end="00:42:59.099" style="s2">to be able to affect that whole set not</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:01.770" style="s2">a subset of it and then what are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.099" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">underlying physiologic pathways that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.770" end="00:43:05.310" style="s2">mediate all that which ones are mediated</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:08.849" style="s2">via a single colon or glutamate or</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.310" end="00:43:11.609" style="s2">catecholamines or ion channels or so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.849" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">map that out used kind of systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.609" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">dynamics for looking at how those all</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:17.220" style="s2">interact with each other and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">pathways that regulate them and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.220" end="00:43:20.820" style="s2">looked at the chemistry that maps to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.710" style="s2">those and then started our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.820" end="00:43:24.150" style="s2">hypothesis development process for what</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.710" end="00:43:26.220" style="s2">we could do to upregulate</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.150" end="00:43:27.570" style="s2">all of those systems simultaneously in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.220" end="00:43:29.820" style="s2">way that would actually up regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.570" end="00:43:31.140" style="s2">regulatory capacity of the system where</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.820" end="00:43:32.609" style="s2">after someone had been on it for a while</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.140" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">rather than get addicted and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.609" end="00:43:37.530" style="s2">downregulated it could actually have</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">lasting baseline elevation so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.530" end="00:43:42.619" style="s2">say I take I take qualia what&#39;s my first</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:46.290" style="s2">week going to be like what&#39;s a typical</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.619" end="00:43:48.330" style="s2">experience of someone who uses qualia in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.290" end="00:43:49.980" style="s2">the first week and then you know second</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.330" end="00:43:58.440" style="s2">third and you know short-term and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.980" end="00:44:01.170" style="s2">long-term so we have done a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.440" end="00:44:04.020" style="s2">internal you know single blinded trials</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.170" end="00:44:06.359" style="s2">we were just engaged in their first</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.020" end="00:44:07.980" style="s2">double-blind of trials right now but we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.359" end="00:44:09.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have results I can&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.980" end="00:44:11.250" style="s2">claim about what one will experience I</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.660" end="00:44:15.030" style="s2">can say what many people have claimed</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.250" end="00:44:15.360" style="s2">and many people is quite large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.030" end="00:44:18.870" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.360" end="00:44:20.010" style="s2">now and obviously it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.870" end="00:44:21.870" style="s2">different experiences for different</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.010" end="00:44:23.340" style="s2">people I want to say first quality is</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.870" end="00:44:26.580" style="s2">actually not recommended for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.340" end="00:44:30.930" style="s2">there are contraindications specifically</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.580" end="00:44:33.900" style="s2">if people are on psychiatric meds or</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.900" end="00:44:37.890" style="s2">treating hypertension then we would not</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.850" end="00:44:40.500" style="s2">recommend people use it without</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.550" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">people do it on their own because there</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.630" end="00:44:54.870" style="s2">are chances of interactions so that said</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.870" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;re getting an extremely high positive</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">of people about 16% of people that</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.470" end="00:47:28.710" style="s2">really working towards is being able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.490" end="00:47:30.900" style="s2">vet all of the different technologies</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.710" end="00:47:32.910" style="s2">that can meaningfully enhance people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:39.390" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">neuro tech really betting which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.010" end="00:47:46.110" style="s2">effective and that are effective not</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:49.020" style="s2">just at short-term and partial effects</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.110" end="00:47:52.080" style="s2">but positive system up regulation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.020" end="00:47:53.550" style="s2">then effective for what for what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.080" end="00:47:55.620" style="s2">of people for what kinds of pathway</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.550" end="00:47:58.230" style="s2">issues etc being able to synthesize all</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.620" end="00:48:00.420" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been being able to develop a</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.420" end="00:48:06.690" style="s2">personal data that is synthesized with</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.360" end="00:48:09.030" style="s2">it you know unique kind of a I like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.690" end="00:48:12.060" style="s2">combinatorial algorithms they can then</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.030" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">be able to direct people to what</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.060" end="00:48:15.690" style="s2">technologies have the highest</p>

<p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:18.270" style="s2">them for the kinds of things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.650" end="00:48:19.710" style="s2">wanting to work on and then being able</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.270" end="00:48:22.260" style="s2">to have a deeper version of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.710" end="00:48:24.050" style="s2">available for medical practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.260" end="00:48:25.890" style="s2">really pioneering the future of</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.600" end="00:48:35.270" style="s2">customize the therapeutics based on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.370" end="00:48:37.710" style="s2">kind of deeper interpretive model and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.270" end="00:48:39.510" style="s2">we don&#39;t say too much about that yet</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.710" end="00:48:41.010" style="s2">because you know one should share about</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.510" end="00:48:43.050" style="s2">the things as we were able to release</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.010" end="00:48:45.290" style="s2">meaningful offerings but if you keep it</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.050" end="00:48:47.220" style="s2">checking in we will see more monthly</p>
