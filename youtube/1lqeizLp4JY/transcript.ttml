<p begin="00:00:05.470" end="00:00:11.930" style="s2">when I was in Jerusalem walking around</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.500" end="00:00:13.490" style="s2">at night in the old city and down around</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.930" end="00:00:15.620" style="s2">the old city everywhere I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.490" end="00:00:19.400" style="s2">Jerusalem granite it was like oh cloud</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.620" end="00:00:22.789" style="s2">mushrooms turned to the side stops but</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.400" end="00:00:26.089" style="s2">everywhere in where the carved stone was</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.789" end="00:00:27.800" style="s2">it was like being on suicide because</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.089" end="00:00:31.880" style="s2">with a buddy of mine who Stefan suicide</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.800" end="00:00:33.410" style="s2">before had no effect my son all the son</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.880" end="00:00:34.010" style="s2">was also with me he didn&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.410" end="00:00:37.270" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.010" end="00:00:39.560" style="s2">so my first thought was okay there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.270" end="00:00:41.240" style="s2">Jerusalem Granath isn&#39;t actually a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.560" end="00:00:44.420" style="s2">granite I think like an order of ischial</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.240" end="00:00:45.980" style="s2">I install on okay there&#39;s got to be high</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.420" end="00:00:48.350" style="s2">quartz content here&#39;s something to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.980" end="00:00:49.850" style="s2">with specularity effect or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.350" end="00:00:52.190" style="s2">the fact that other people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.850" end="00:00:54.410" style="s2">seeing it seems like it wasn&#39;t strictly</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.190" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">an optic phenomenon and could be a topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.410" end="00:01:03.290" style="s2">which is they could be what Antarctic</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:05.780" style="s2">and Arctic hmm basically the eye is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.290" end="00:01:07.670" style="s2">perceiving four nama phenomena is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.780" end="00:01:10.600" style="s2">visual stimulus because it&#39;s not able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.670" end="00:01:10.600" style="s2">parse it in any other manner</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.079" end="00:01:21.140" style="s2">see so you seem to Adele very deep and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.619" end="00:01:24.319" style="s2">esoteric States and well yes after the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.140" end="00:01:26.899" style="s2">pronounced work with Denis I got into</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.899" end="00:01:31.159" style="s2">Freemasonry</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.649" end="00:01:34.600" style="s2">so I went through every regular body of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.159" end="00:01:40.639" style="s2">York right the craft Lodge boy large</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.049" end="00:01:56.659" style="s2">it&#39;s something I know I know zero about</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.759" end="00:01:58.670" style="s2">absolutely nothing about masonry despite</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.659" end="00:02:00.289" style="s2">the fact that the liturgy is anchored in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.670" end="00:02:01.490" style="s2">the Old Testament it has more in common</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.289" end="00:02:02.990" style="s2">with Buddhism that it does with</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.490" end="00:02:07.189" style="s2">Christianity and the fact that it treats</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.990" end="00:02:08.750" style="s2">its mystery tradition in its essence</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.189" end="00:02:10.300" style="s2">anchored around the ease of the object</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.750" end="00:02:13.390" style="s2">lesson</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.300" end="00:02:16.810" style="s2">the structure I mean if it was someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.390" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">model of a hierarchy Freemasonry is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.810" end="00:02:21.610" style="s2">too bad one to look at really the basis</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">of the organization is the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.610" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">acting of your own free will in a court</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.030" end="00:02:33.820" style="s2">they&#39;re definitely people who like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.020" end="00:02:36.010" style="s2">coalesce around corrupted power issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.820" end="00:02:39.160" style="s2">with that kind of an attitude up until I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">think 1967 you could be excommunicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.160" end="00:02:44.740" style="s2">from the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:47.560" style="s2">all right you know yeah I know this very</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.740" end="00:02:49.450" style="s2">conservative Catholic and he he has the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.560" end="00:02:51.730" style="s2">view that Freemasonry is really the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:53.050" style="s2">devil right it&#39;s just it&#39;s just he has</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.730" end="00:02:55.960" style="s2">this book that&#39;s he has this whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.050" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">conspiracy theory that is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.960" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">know there&#39;s almost there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">of anti-semitism in it and you know I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:06.550" style="s2">this guy I know it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:08.920" style="s2">before he was a Stalinist right he was</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.550" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">he was a really hardcore communist since</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.920" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">he you know you really thought that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">really and then and then he converted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">this very strong form of Catholicism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:22.540" style="s2">and so you know basically he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:25.210" style="s2">there&#39;s this global you know Freemasonry</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.540" end="00:03:27.730" style="s2">conspiracy of some kind that that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.210" end="00:03:32.140" style="s2">know bringing people up destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.730" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">world and you know it&#39;s a good joke well</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.140" end="00:03:36.370" style="s2">the only Masonic conspiracy I saw who</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:39.130" style="s2">was sending me to a district office in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.370" end="00:03:42.550" style="s2">Chapter did to what the district office</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.130" end="00:03:45.130" style="s2">yeah so that the chair or the office is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.550" end="00:03:48.970" style="s2">called the grand superintendent it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.130" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">equivalent to the deputy Grand Master in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:54.670" style="s2">craft Lodge so it&#39;s your responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:56.020" style="s2">act as the representative of the grand</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.670" end="00:03:58.510" style="s2">first principal to visit all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.020" end="00:04:00.760" style="s2">chapters in the district for their</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.510" end="00:04:05.770" style="s2">installations and inspects the work of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.760" end="00:04:07.410" style="s2">degree so it&#39;s very secretive right like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.770" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">how much can you speak about it like</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.410" end="00:04:13.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve all got websites now yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">like organization I know has a public</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.750" end="00:04:18.669" style="s2">website I see okay bye-bye just my</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.900" end="00:04:21.820" style="s2">curiosity as like you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.669" end="00:04:23.560" style="s2">work that you do like much of the work</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.820" end="00:04:25.270" style="s2">is really the work of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.560" end="00:04:26.889" style="s2">an organization so as you go through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.270" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">different chairs and any of the Masonic</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.889" end="00:04:31.210" style="s2">bodies they have some little roles and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:35.169" style="s2">responsibilities so you basically go</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.210" end="00:04:37.150" style="s2">from door to the master of the lodge and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.169" end="00:04:38.950" style="s2">learning different sets of Skittles to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.150" end="00:04:40.150" style="s2">go through our skills and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.950" end="00:04:42.520" style="s2">responsibilities as we go through each</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">one of those chairs and then that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.520" end="00:04:47.230" style="s2">organist local organization instead</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:55.000" style="s2">mimicked up this at the district level</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.230" end="00:04:59.139" style="s2">and then once again the grant so and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.000" end="00:05:03.820" style="s2">what&#39;s the so so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.139" end="00:05:05.350" style="s2">developmental path is somewhat or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.820" end="00:05:09.010" style="s2">there was self developmental and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.350" end="00:05:12.820" style="s2">developmental of the society as well yep</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.010" end="00:05:15.479" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s the pram or the phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.820" end="00:05:20.440" style="s2">that they use to make it meant better so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.479" end="00:05:23.710" style="s2">good men better okay yeah so the way I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.440" end="00:05:25.750" style="s2">see it is you&#39;re exercising discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.710" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">principally through the memory work that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.750" end="00:05:28.870" style="s2">you have to do for ritual so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">main things that go on at a lodge you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.870" end="00:05:34.120" style="s2">got the business of running your</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">organization mmm minutes a regular</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.120" end="00:05:38.020" style="s2">agenda stress is running by Robert&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">Rules of Order all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.020" end="00:05:41.830" style="s2">and then on top of that you have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:45.070" style="s2">ritual work so those two pieces come</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.830" end="00:05:47.140" style="s2">together and then a ritual space you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.070" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">basically taking a candidate putting</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.140" end="00:05:51.070" style="s2">them into a narrative in a specific</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:52.889" style="s2">position so they can experience that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.070" end="00:06:00.010" style="s2">story for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.889" end="00:06:02.350" style="s2">mm-hmm and then from the craft Lodge and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.010" end="00:06:04.300" style="s2">the two principal figures three figures</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.350" end="00:06:09.910" style="s2">solemn king of Israel higher up higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.300" end="00:06:14.020" style="s2">and higher so slow down man I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.910" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">following solomon king of israel yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.020" end="00:06:18.760" style="s2">being of Tyre and Hiram Abiff or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">three principal characters within</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.760" end="00:06:23.800" style="s2">freemason so the two kings are very</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:27.580" style="s2">obvious Hiram Abiff is considered in</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.800" end="00:06:32.440" style="s2">Freemasonry to be master architect or a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.580" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">master builder of salts temple is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.440" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">before the completion of the temple</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.090" style="s2">he&#39;s accosted by three ruffians who want</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:39.190" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.090" end="00:06:43.810" style="s2">for the secret so him and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:46.990" style="s2">give up the secret see boy that&#39;s ok</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.810" end="00:06:49.479" style="s2">deep Lessman integrity they&#39;re people</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.990" end="00:06:53.860" style="s2">with a pretty deep lesson and integrity</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.479" end="00:06:56.470" style="s2">there uh-huh right yeah yeah I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.860" end="00:07:02.430" style="s2">it&#39;s about integrity and some deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.470" end="00:07:04.930" style="s2">right and it was interesting watching</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.430" end="00:07:07.030" style="s2">some Peterson look lectures because</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.930" end="00:07:17.200" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff out of there that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.030" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">out of my sonic ritual for example the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.200" end="00:07:21.100" style="s2">one passage in the beginning was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">word and the Word was with God and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.100" end="00:07:24.840" style="s2">Word was God</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:31.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a few other things in there that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.720" end="00:07:33.460" style="s2">yeah something that digs into the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.780" end="00:07:34.810" style="s2">mysteries of the degree so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.460" end="00:07:37.139" style="s2">of stuff I can talk about easily that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.810" end="00:07:39.400" style="s2">public domain mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.139" end="00:07:51.250" style="s2">any of the science secrets and stuff</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.210" end="00:08:03.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of run into each other in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.849" end="00:08:07.139" style="s2">circles in our in discussions about</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.550" end="00:08:13.260" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson know on some level</p>

<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:09.880" style="s2">telogen things going on I think yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.149" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">I think well you know I was I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.880" end="00:09:17.079" style="s2">several essays about Peterson mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:19.269" style="s2">response well you know it was I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.079" end="00:09:22.360" style="s2">just a developmental practice of trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.269" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">to try to you know work out his thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.360" end="00:09:28.029" style="s2">in my own mind and and and also as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:31.300" style="s2">defence against people who were</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.029" end="00:09:34.269" style="s2">attacking him in some kind of way so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.300" end="00:09:35.740" style="s2">know I kind of jumped into that and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.269" end="00:09:40.660" style="s2">noticed that there was there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.740" end="00:09:42.430" style="s2">people you know who who a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.660" end="00:09:44.260" style="s2">who are you know very hostile towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.430" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">them who I knew or on the progressive</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.260" end="00:09:49.240" style="s2">side of the you know and I had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:50.589" style="s2">progressive friends and they find it</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.240" end="00:09:52.690" style="s2">strange that I would be writing about</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.589" end="00:09:57.070" style="s2">about about Jordan Peterson some sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.690" end="00:10:00.970" style="s2">and so so there seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.070" end="00:10:03.779" style="s2">very compelling going on there what do</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.970" end="00:10:07.089" style="s2">you think about that what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.779" end="00:10:08.709" style="s2">there&#39;s the cognitive dissonance going</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.089" end="00:10:10.329" style="s2">on I mean you&#39;ve got part of the fun</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.709" end="00:10:12.010" style="s2">fact or the fear uncertainty doubt</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.329" end="00:10:15.459" style="s2">that&#39;s constantly being pumped out by</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.010" end="00:10:20.500" style="s2">the media fear uncertainty doubt yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.459" end="00:10:23.790" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s an observation that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.500" end="00:10:27.880" style="s2">stress can drop like a cube by 30 points</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.790" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">the way stress can drop like you by 30</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.880" end="00:10:33.579" style="s2">points relatively like sighs I think in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:35.350" style="s2">a lot of ways people are just getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.579" end="00:10:36.910" style="s2">dumbed down so you&#39;ve got massive</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.350" end="00:10:39.550" style="s2">amounts of complexity which people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.910" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">very poorly adapted you deal in the</p>

<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:47.190" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s constantly ramping up and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.060" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got this an introduction of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.190" end="00:10:53.100" style="s2">ideology in a social discourse which I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:56.110" style="s2">think kind of roots back to Steinem</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.100" end="00:11:00.519" style="s2">respecters rude back roots back to wait</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.110" end="00:11:02.890" style="s2">who Gloria Steinem gray Steinem okay the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.519" end="00:11:04.220" style="s2">concept of the patriarchy mmm-hmm I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.890" end="00:11:06.199" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.220" end="00:11:08.930" style="s2">the archetype will emit in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.199" end="00:11:12.050" style="s2">transactional analysis sense I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.930" end="00:11:13.459" style="s2">says about like patriarchy you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.050" end="00:11:15.050" style="s2">have an adult conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.459" end="00:11:18.259" style="s2">anything in that domain after that point</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:19.550" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s going on with that not that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.259" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">might be a good thing to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.550" end="00:11:23.000" style="s2">actually you actually it&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:27.879" style="s2">I&#39;ve been writing about recently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.000" end="00:11:31.730" style="s2">like this word patriarchy it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.879" end="00:11:36.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a misnomer almost in every way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.730" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">like doesn&#39;t describe historical reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.040" end="00:11:44.839" style="s2">you know kind of meet up yes really yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:49.879" style="s2">I mean rest a two-degree where there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.839" end="00:11:51.199" style="s2">a criticism about hierarchy but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.879" end="00:11:52.339" style="s2">answer logically we don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.199" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">patriarchy used to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.339" end="00:11:59.870" style="s2">patrilineal matrilineal this reinvention</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">words or you know salting the lexical</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.870" end="00:12:03.949" style="s2">field so we can&#39;t use the word</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:05.860" style="s2">discrimination anymore because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.949" end="00:12:08.180" style="s2">automatically associated with race</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.860" end="00:12:11.930" style="s2">discrimination you can&#39;t have a power of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.180" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">discernment yeah like a weird double</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.930" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2">thing going on with the whole I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:21.230" style="s2">the two concepts that patriarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:24.949" style="s2">whole idea that the personal is</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.230" end="00:12:29.300" style="s2">political as basically static context</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.949" end="00:12:31.970" style="s2">people so you think those two things the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.300" end="00:12:35.569" style="s2">fact that the patriarchy and that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.970" end="00:12:37.459" style="s2">person is political the person was</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.569" end="00:12:40.910" style="s2">political I think those political</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.459" end="00:12:42.860" style="s2">mmm-hmm those are two seeds that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.910" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">set up for trouble I mean people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.860" end="00:12:47.059" style="s2">really look you know twenty thirty</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:51.490" style="s2">thousand iterations down how that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.059" end="00:12:53.660" style="s2">gonna go if you set up the basis for</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.490" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">conversation where you can&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.660" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">adult conversation and then you start</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.300" end="00:13:03.259" style="s2">making it okay for people to just kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.250" end="00:13:06.649" style="s2">of dump their unfiltered personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.259" end="00:13:08.569" style="s2">in a public space yeah a recipe for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.649" end="00:13:13.430" style="s2">lot of social problems just no way</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.569" end="00:13:15.649" style="s2">around it yeah maybe one thing one thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.430" end="00:13:17.410" style="s2">that Peterson says is he calls this or I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.649" end="00:13:23.660" style="s2">guess it comes from Newman or fro</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.410" end="00:13:26.030" style="s2">is devouring mother pathology right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.660" end="00:13:27.860" style="s2">so it&#39;s like when when you when you in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.030" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">the postmodern age when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.860" end="00:13:33.050" style="s2">destroy the notion of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:35.090" style="s2">patriarchy I&#39;d make sure I keep both in</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.050" end="00:13:37.180" style="s2">fact you know because when I&#39;m when I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.090" end="00:13:41.030" style="s2">was growing up I had no concept of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.180" end="00:13:42.650" style="s2">masculinity or femininity both those</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.030" end="00:13:46.400" style="s2">things were unimportant to me right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.650" end="00:13:48.080" style="s2">just I in fact I I think femininity was</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.400" end="00:13:53.240" style="s2">more important than me I grew my hair</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.080" end="00:13:55.850" style="s2">long and I copied women and so both</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.240" end="00:13:57.950" style="s2">those things in the past modern age get</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.850" end="00:13:59.480" style="s2">kind of destroyed right and then they</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.950" end="00:14:01.700" style="s2">kind of become subliminal and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.480" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">underground and then the pathology both</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.700" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">side of those arises so you get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">tyrannical father and and you get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:13.270" style="s2">devouring mother there&#39;s this aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:16.910" style="s2">the a horrid a historicity as well so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.270" end="00:14:19.400" style="s2">mm-hmm we&#39;re in an age where we need 72</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.910" end="00:14:22.850" style="s2">words to describe gender yet nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.400" end="00:14:26.180" style="s2">able to use the word androgynous I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.850" end="00:14:28.730" style="s2">these concepts of androgyny go right</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.180" end="00:14:31.520" style="s2">back at least as far back as mythology</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.730" end="00:14:33.380" style="s2">well Adam was was not a man well he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.520" end="00:14:35.090" style="s2">androgynous wasn&#39;t he I mean had the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.380" end="00:14:36.220" style="s2">original who the original Adam in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.090" end="00:14:38.960" style="s2">biblical sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.220" end="00:14:43.850" style="s2">was androgynous and what am I correct</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.960" end="00:14:45.530" style="s2">about that he was let&#39;s say both male</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.850" end="00:14:47.990" style="s2">and female and then and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.530" end="00:14:53.660" style="s2">that split in two and then God split man</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.990" end="00:14:56.660" style="s2">into male and female and in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.660" end="00:14:59.810" style="s2">certain sense that that you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.660" end="00:15:02.660" style="s2">every every person is sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.810" end="00:15:04.280" style="s2">every person is is you know I you know</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.280" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">qualities obviously and then this split</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.640" end="00:15:14.090" style="s2">in young in terms of split is like the</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.530" end="00:15:31.569" style="s2">right now is is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.579" end="00:15:34.119" style="s2">polarities have become unconcious and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.569" end="00:15:37.809" style="s2">then the repressed aspects of those</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.809" end="00:15:41.529" style="s2">does that make sense to you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.209" end="00:15:44.739" style="s2">kind of the problem I always had with</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.529" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">Catholicism or I guess Christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.739" end="00:15:49.629" style="s2">general I mean in the University of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:52.029" style="s2">nickel it was the Antichrist so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.629" end="00:15:53.290" style="s2">interesting coming into this space with</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.029" end="00:15:57.850" style="s2">Peterson because I feel like we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.290" end="00:15:59.739" style="s2">this cut ashes on inverse angles coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.850" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">at it and then I ended up pretty much in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.739" end="00:16:06.459" style="s2">the same thing space so I mean I do have</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:09.160" style="s2">some criticisms some of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.459" end="00:16:12.489" style="s2">he&#39;s got into like the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.160" end="00:16:16.019" style="s2">dominance hierarchy the way and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.489" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">omits the dominance hierarchy yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.019" end="00:16:21.069" style="s2">don&#39;t think the concept is remotely</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.220" end="00:16:23.649" style="s2">robust enough to actually cover that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.069" end="00:16:25.449" style="s2">didn&#39;t he change that in a sense and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.649" end="00:16:27.189" style="s2">didn&#39;t you sort of say oh you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.449" end="00:16:30.100" style="s2">should be the competence hierarchy then</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.189" end="00:16:31.899" style="s2">I think that&#39;s enough so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.100" end="00:16:33.970" style="s2">it as influence hierarchies these</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.899" end="00:16:35.999" style="s2">influence hierarchies are structure on</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.139" end="00:16:47.350" style="s2">communication I mean there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.790" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">different things if you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.350" end="00:16:53.350" style="s2">it as influence hierarchy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:55.419" style="s2">explicitly meiling it&#39;s not completely a</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.530" end="00:19:16.760" style="s2">yeah so you said you said that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.020" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">of competence hierarchies is not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.760" end="00:19:22.520" style="s2">robust and not a robust I have to think</p>

<p begin="00:19:30.679" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">like major criticisms of his ideas of</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:42.920" style="s2">mean there&#39;s not really meant that much</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.050" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a nuance here and there the</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.570" end="00:19:52.820" style="s2">there was a one thing I wrote down mid</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.090" end="00:19:55.900" style="s2">lecture he was talking about Young&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.820" end="00:19:58.190" style="s2">criticism of Boyd in each he and the</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.190" end="00:20:04.250" style="s2">values so I see a lot since he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:06.110" style="s2">have placed the subs or the context</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.250" end="00:20:08.929" style="s2">here&#39;s the individual here&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:24.530" style="s2">that level but let&#39;s dig a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.760" end="00:20:26.840" style="s2">deeper into the cultural level here I</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.530" end="00:20:28.040" style="s2">think something that the Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.840" end="00:20:30.830" style="s2">brothers got into when you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.040" end="00:20:32.630" style="s2">develop your own model then you start</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.910" end="00:20:41.330" style="s2">sure if okay can you refine that or make</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">it a little bit more clear for me to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.330" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">understand I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not sure if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:49.250" style="s2">get it okay yeah I think you you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:51.980" style="s2">basically do have to create your whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.250" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">value system not you&#39;re not creating it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.980" end="00:20:55.790" style="s2">from scratch but you&#39;re testing</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:20:58.429" style="s2">everything in your toolbox if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.790" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually tested it and actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.429" end="00:21:02.420" style="s2">mastered it then it&#39;s not really your</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:04.070" style="s2">toolset well maybe there&#39;s maybe both</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.420" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">things are true you you create values</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.070" end="00:21:09.470" style="s2">but you also you draw in archetypes at</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:12.440" style="s2">the same time like yes those things</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.470" end="00:21:13.240" style="s2">simultaneously in Freemasonry there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.440" end="00:21:15.650" style="s2">metaphor of</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.650" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">temple any kind of rebuilding from there</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.670" end="00:21:24.760" style="s2">I think he&#39;s also got an aspect of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:26.710" style="s2">in his philosophy where you&#39;re yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.760" end="00:21:28.510" style="s2">everything&#39;s kind of blowing apart but</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.710" end="00:21:30.040" style="s2">you&#39;re going back digging into the</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.040" end="00:21:34.300" style="s2">archetypes and kind of reinvigorating</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:35.920" style="s2">the whole thing miss that&#39;s that burning</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.300" end="00:21:38.380" style="s2">off of the Deadwood process that has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.920" end="00:21:41.170" style="s2">happen regularly in the more you defer</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.380" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">it well or aspire to get out of control</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.170" end="00:21:45.580" style="s2">yeah but what about the value what about</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:48.310" style="s2">creating values how do we create values</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.580" end="00:21:50.020" style="s2">I mean it seems like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.310" end="00:21:52.210" style="s2">universal values right there&#39;s love and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.020" end="00:21:57.630" style="s2">hate and there&#39;s all these you know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.210" end="00:22:00.160" style="s2">then there&#39;s there&#39;s you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.630" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">you&#39;re creating your value reference</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:09.070" style="s2">really I&#39;m creating them yourself then</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.130" end="00:22:10.780" style="s2">you&#39;ve just adopted somebody else&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.070" end="00:22:12.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve just become like what Gurdjieff</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.780" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">called mechanical man you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.280" end="00:22:17.230" style="s2">mechanical in here yeah your activities</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">so becoming conscious I&#39;m at Thein</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">you&#39;re running on script you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:28.840" style="s2">behavior and then so much hater is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.000" end="00:22:30.700" style="s2">completely deeply obituaries like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.840" end="00:22:32.200" style="s2">is what does an individual mean like how</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.700" end="00:22:34.210" style="s2">do you become an individual you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.200" end="00:22:35.920" style="s2">because you know I guess there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.210" end="00:22:37.990" style="s2">few individuals in some sense it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.920" end="00:22:40.030" style="s2">we&#39;re all individual but how many people</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.990" end="00:22:46.300" style="s2">are actually individuals I mean how many</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.030" end="00:22:48.220" style="s2">people are just souls in a sensor or mmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.300" end="00:22:52.630" style="s2">I think that is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.220" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">individuation yeah yeah you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.630" end="00:22:57.160" style="s2">read Newman&#39;s book he talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:59.170" style="s2">being that being a you know this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.160" end="00:23:01.740" style="s2">arising from them a maternal or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.170" end="00:23:04.810" style="s2">matriarchy and then you know and the and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.740" end="00:23:07.150" style="s2">the the patriarchy arises from from bat</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.810" end="00:23:10.030" style="s2">right then we have our society right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.150" end="00:23:11.290" style="s2">which has tikona and then and then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.030" end="00:23:13.900" style="s2">get young and then you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.290" end="00:23:17.350" style="s2">go back and you have to kind of reunite</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.900" end="00:23:19.500" style="s2">with I guess the the the the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.350" end="00:23:22.150" style="s2">the matriarch of something like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.500" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">well it&#39;s got to be that overworld thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.150" end="00:23:27.070" style="s2">happening and I mean it&#39;s gotta be what</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:29.890" style="s2">or Laura or us the snake eating its tail</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:31.270" style="s2">yeah well yeah you come up you come up</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.890" end="00:23:32.800" style="s2">from that and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.270" end="00:23:34.630" style="s2">and then you you you developed</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.800" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">consciousness and that that&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.630" end="00:23:39.250" style="s2">much a male Judah in the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:41.620" style="s2">it&#39;s been very much a patriarchy in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.250" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">sense but but perhaps we&#39;re moving to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.620" end="00:23:48.910" style="s2">like what&#39;s that if you dig into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">roots so I spent a good chunk of time</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.910" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">studying a Cepheid zero that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:56.890" style="s2">transcription of Abraham&#39;s original</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:24:01.720" style="s2">vision it&#39;s like a technical analog to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.890" end="00:24:05.080" style="s2">Genesis 1:1 it&#39;s that&#39;s the capital of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.720" end="00:24:07.570" style="s2">Texas is it isn&#39;t it no so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.080" end="00:24:10.300" style="s2">thinking about it it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:16.780" style="s2">the foundational like the first written</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.300" end="00:24:18.760" style="s2">see how much truth there is to that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.780" end="00:24:21.340" style="s2">terms of its temporal placement it has</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.760" end="00:24:24.160" style="s2">been placed like do you hundred year</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.340" end="00:24:26.890" style="s2">later anyways it goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.160" end="00:24:28.150" style="s2">creation of existence through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.890" end="00:24:29.530" style="s2">alphabet that&#39;s where the tree of life</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.150" end="00:24:32.290" style="s2">the key to space and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.530" end="00:24:34.350" style="s2">comes then but yeah Lord of Hosts</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.290" end="00:24:36.850" style="s2">creates the world through three divine</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.350" end="00:24:39.780" style="s2">Serafim or feminine angelic figures</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.850" end="00:24:42.190" style="s2">number letter and sound so right at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.780" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">foundation of it there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.190" end="00:24:46.059" style="s2">intertwining of the masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:49.390" style="s2">feminine well that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.059" end="00:24:51.280" style="s2">like that counter counter to the Trinity</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.390" end="00:24:52.630" style="s2">because the Trinity is all male isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.280" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2">you just mentioned that there were three</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.630" end="00:24:57.970" style="s2">three female principles yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:25:01.110" style="s2">part of what not an expert in this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.970" end="00:25:04.870" style="s2">so I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.110" end="00:25:09.220" style="s2">flailing around here but I think in</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.870" end="00:25:11.290" style="s2">terms of the Christian context you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.220" end="00:25:13.300" style="s2">got the development of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.290" end="00:25:14.950" style="s2">tradition you got all the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.300" end="00:25:18.280" style="s2">going on with the Roman Empire and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.950" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">basically as the state of Rome is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.280" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">collapsing and this power structure is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">2pi to the land physically well if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:27.100" style="s2">can&#39;t control that land anymore in power</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:30.070" style="s2">structure you get on put that power</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.100" end="00:25:32.740" style="s2">structure up in the air unassailable to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:35.620" style="s2">the common people and then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.740" end="00:25:37.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve got dominion over everything so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.620" end="00:25:39.429" style="s2">think it&#39;s kind of a corruption of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.030" end="00:25:41.950" style="s2">philosophy an intentional corruption you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.429" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">know order to exert power I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.950" end="00:25:44.730" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:46.620" style="s2">criticism I ever had a crisis that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.730" end="00:25:49.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t do a very good job on error</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.620" end="00:25:51.630" style="s2">correction or making sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.290" end="00:25:53.550" style="s2">transmission wouldn&#39;t be corrupted but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.630" end="00:25:55.350" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.550" end="00:25:57.750" style="s2">because that&#39;s what this that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.350" end="00:26:01.740" style="s2">Jakob Jakob Lee but with his his whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.750" end="00:26:04.380" style="s2">theory was that this whole theory was</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.740" end="00:26:06.570" style="s2">that the Christian the Christian the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.380" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">Messiah the Christian revelation it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.570" end="00:26:11.690" style="s2">incomplete in some kind of a way and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">that Jesus wasn&#39;t was not liberated yet</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.690" end="00:26:18.060" style="s2">and that you had to go into you had to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:20.340" style="s2">go and liberate Jesus and this was a no</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.060" end="00:26:23.910" style="s2">that was his sort of thing that Jesus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.340" end="00:26:25.470" style="s2">soul in some sense was trapped and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.910" end="00:26:28.820" style="s2">and and that&#39;s why there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.470" end="00:26:28.820" style="s2">suffering around Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.070" end="00:26:33.750" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting psychological</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.050" end="00:26:35.850" style="s2">read on it it&#39;s one read and the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.750" end="00:26:38.520" style="s2">read he had was that the tradition broke</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.850" end="00:26:40.500" style="s2">you know Brooke in half so his idea was</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.520" end="00:26:41.970" style="s2">the Jews need need to embrace the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.500" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">Messiah I need to embrace the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.970" end="00:26:46.170" style="s2">and the Christians need to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:48.060" style="s2">the Jews to bring the tradition together</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.170" end="00:26:51.990" style="s2">like the tradition had been broken at</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.060" end="00:26:52.910" style="s2">the point of Jesus which was you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.990" end="00:26:55.140" style="s2">there&#39;s all these different</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.910" end="00:26:56.700" style="s2">interpretations right he also was they</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.140" end="00:26:58.980" style="s2">also you know the Jewish some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.700" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">Jewish mysticism says that that you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.980" end="00:27:04.800" style="s2">we that God was this that the human</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.950" style="s2">needs to heal God is not the other way</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.800" end="00:27:10.710" style="s2">around right the job&#39;s job in this was</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.950" end="00:27:13.110" style="s2">part of Julie&#39;s idea that job jobs jobs</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.710" end="00:27:16.140" style="s2">mission was within the sense to to heal</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.110" end="00:27:18.780" style="s2">God and human because God was was that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.140" end="00:27:20.250" style="s2">God principle was was you know God</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.780" end="00:27:22.170" style="s2">because God created the world and God</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.250" end="00:27:25.320" style="s2">created duality right God created</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.170" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">suffering yeah and that the human beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.320" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">job I guess it&#39;s like a bet what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">saying about creating values human being</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:35.150" style="s2">job is to is to is to is to heal the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">divine rather than the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.150" end="00:27:40.670" style="s2">unity so there&#39;s a one aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:45.320" style="s2">cosmology that says that the universe</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.670" end="00:27:47.580" style="s2">was created by the numinous</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.320" end="00:27:49.020" style="s2">differentiating itself or shattering</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.580" end="00:27:51.690" style="s2">itself into a million pieces</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.020" end="00:27:53.220" style="s2">yeah so that it could become</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.690" end="00:27:54.870" style="s2">differentiated you know order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.220" end="00:27:57.810" style="s2">understand and know itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.870" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">and then yeah our job is to basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.810" end="00:28:09.180" style="s2">figure out the meaning you know it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:11.940" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a segue for me for</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.180" end="00:28:15.300" style="s2">Peterson and Harris which I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.940" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">chatted a bit about in text but Harris</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.300" end="00:28:20.940" style="s2">always comes off to me like a tourist</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:22.770" style="s2">like I don&#39;t he doesn&#39;t read for me like</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.940" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">someone who&#39;s really experienced in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.770" end="00:28:27.540" style="s2">Europe or that kind of trembling feared</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:30.030" style="s2">divine piety like he&#39;s never really well</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.540" end="00:28:32.850" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t presume to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.030" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">his experiences particularly but I do</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.850" end="00:28:38.040" style="s2">think that I do think that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.780" style="s2">he&#39;s done these Buddhists retreat and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.040" end="00:28:44.070" style="s2">then he&#39;s trying to invent the secular</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.780" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">religion is problematic you know so he</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.070" end="00:28:50.310" style="s2">sought it wants it like he studied with</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">this great ocean teacher and and yet he</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.310" end="00:28:55.230" style="s2">wants to interpret the whole thing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:58.440" style="s2">his own in his own way and and and in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.230" end="00:29:03.060" style="s2">secular materialistic you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.440" end="00:29:06.810" style="s2">way which is is is you know I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.060" end="00:29:08.580" style="s2">if if he was really operating within the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.810" end="00:29:12.030" style="s2">dough I think in that within the domain</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.580" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">of truth in terms of his relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.030" end="00:29:16.740" style="s2">with with whatever this particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">teacher was was trying to pass on to him</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.740" end="00:29:25.350" style="s2">so I think well yeah and I think he I</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">think he has this very sharp kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.350" end="00:29:30.270" style="s2">analytical intellect but he just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:32.820" style="s2">seem to grass symbology in the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.270" end="00:29:35.490" style="s2">world in any in any way he just he just</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.820" end="00:29:38.820" style="s2">he just he just he just reduces that to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.490" end="00:29:41.310" style="s2">its you know it&#39;s just he just reduces</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.820" end="00:29:43.230" style="s2">that to its lowest denominator over and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.310" end="00:29:45.060" style="s2">over again and you know really he just</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.230" end="00:29:46.650" style="s2">it&#39;s funny that I was listening to his</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.060" end="00:29:48.630" style="s2">discussion and all the people all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.650" end="00:29:52.620" style="s2">all the religions he was criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.630" end="00:29:55.170" style="s2">were were Isis and Scientology all is</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.620" end="00:29:57.270" style="s2">like modern you know that&#39;s that little</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.170" end="00:30:00.570" style="s2">he was criticizing and and that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.270" end="00:30:04.130" style="s2">those religions are as a result of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.570" end="00:30:08.150" style="s2">this I think materialistic reduction is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.130" end="00:30:08.150" style="s2">pointed point of view trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.210" end="00:30:14.420" style="s2">just take the techniques out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.520" end="00:30:18.050" style="s2">living body of the of the tradition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.420" end="00:30:19.880" style="s2">the idea of art a technique says that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.050" end="00:30:21.770" style="s2">this is the technical competence</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.880" end="00:30:23.900" style="s2">required to exercise the art but you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.770" end="00:30:27.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have the art together then it it</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:29.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the like yeah or even in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.380" end="00:30:31.970" style="s2">left-brain right-brain it&#39;s like he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.420" end="00:30:34.430" style="s2">completely left brain or yeah left brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.970" end="00:30:36.140" style="s2">character in the senses yeah some</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.430" end="00:30:38.780" style="s2">computers and talks about transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.140" end="00:30:41.180" style="s2">or tragedy like he can see he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.780" end="00:30:42.890" style="s2">there like yeah he embodies it it</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.180" end="00:30:44.870" style="s2">possesses him when he talks about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.890" end="00:30:47.870" style="s2">not some abstract concept where with</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.870" end="00:30:50.330" style="s2">Paris it also he&#39;s kind of in a smart</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.870" end="00:30:55.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s all pretty abstract and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.330" end="00:30:57.350" style="s2">very elevated yeah at the I&#39;m waiting</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.670" end="00:30:58.520" style="s2">for the Pangburn talks to come out</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.350" end="00:31:00.560" style="s2">officially so I can actually go through</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.520" end="00:31:04.930" style="s2">that and see how that discussion went</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.560" end="00:31:09.530" style="s2">but watching Jonathan as Joe&#39;s reactions</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.930" end="00:31:12.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound like it went too far well</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.530" end="00:31:15.530" style="s2">you know well you know so Peterson put</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.350" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">forward this very elaborate definition</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.530" end="00:31:20.450" style="s2">of what he means by God you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:21.710" style="s2">like 20 different things and and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.450" end="00:31:23.300" style="s2">know he couldn&#39;t even just say it he had</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.710" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">to actually read it because because he</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.300" end="00:31:27.940" style="s2">thought about this stuff for 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:31.160" style="s2">you know and and then and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.940" end="00:31:33.470" style="s2">and then sam harris interrupts him and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.160" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">said excuse me you know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.470" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">is this the same God that says you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:40.820" style="s2">you can&#39;t masturbate it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:44.510" style="s2">are you guys talking about the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.820" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">thing in any sense it&#39;s like no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.510" end="00:31:49.490" style="s2">like a little high school job like come</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:52.370" style="s2">on seriously to have a real conversation</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.490" end="00:31:53.680" style="s2">here and you got to play this like</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.370" end="00:31:56.900" style="s2">what&#39;s this all about</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.680" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">yeah and also it was a fellas yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.900" end="00:32:02.050" style="s2">exactly it was an adolescent response</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:04.550" style="s2">like okay you don&#39;t like the rules right</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.050" end="00:32:07.490" style="s2">so you you want you want to do it all</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.550" end="00:32:09.650" style="s2">yourself right but I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.490" end="00:32:13.610" style="s2">works that way I just I just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.650" end="00:32:15.080" style="s2">it works that way well I did we need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.610" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">have more robust conversations around</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.080" end="00:32:19.100" style="s2">that too so I think if you go through a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:20.400" style="s2">lot of that biblical quotes like in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.100" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">beginning us work</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.400" end="00:32:25.020" style="s2">and the word was with the logos and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:28.050" style="s2">word was the logos well that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.020" end="00:32:29.790" style="s2">take on a meaningful depth and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.050" end="00:32:35.580" style="s2">have to be religious in order to got</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.790" end="00:32:37.560" style="s2">that so I think so the logos as I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.580" end="00:32:40.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like your own personal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.560" end="00:32:44.340" style="s2">with the Newman&#39;s so beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.530" end="00:32:47.240" style="s2">tetragrammaton of the logos is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.340" end="00:32:50.250" style="s2">numinous so I in I in so for himself out</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.240" end="00:32:53.450" style="s2">but nothingness limitless nothing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.250" end="00:32:58.050" style="s2">limitless light so that is the high</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.450" end="00:33:00.450" style="s2">unity but your or our human mediation</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.050" end="00:33:03.690" style="s2">point to do that is through the logos</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:05.910" style="s2">literally through the logos so the old</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.690" end="00:33:10.200" style="s2">is the representation of the rabbi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.910" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">hand pointing to divinity hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.200" end="00:33:15.900" style="s2">frame of reference above is a nail</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">finding the next hey another frame of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.900" end="00:33:22.260" style="s2">reference so you have the highest ideal</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:24.390" style="s2">framed against the residense the future</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.260" end="00:33:31.170" style="s2">in a coherent frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.390" end="00:33:33.000" style="s2">I mean conceptually it was something</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.170" end="00:33:37.530" style="s2">that I clicked for me with that a while</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.000" end="00:33:39.300" style="s2">ago yeah I&#39;ve thought about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.530" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">Tetragrammaton quite a bit I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.300" end="00:33:45.780" style="s2">that&#39;s important that visualization for</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:48.420" style="s2">separated serie that I did posted on</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.780" end="00:33:52.740" style="s2">I personally YouTube channel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.420" end="00:33:58.050" style="s2">going back 20 years now back when flash</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.740" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">for was the thing so I think we start</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.050" end="00:34:06.360" style="s2">reframing some of these discussions</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:08.460" style="s2">later where is this appropriate where is</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.360" end="00:34:11.310" style="s2">the logo specification I think most</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.460" end="00:34:14.730" style="s2">cases the logos is where we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.310" end="00:34:19.620" style="s2">actually addressing this stuff okay like</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.730" end="00:34:21.360" style="s2">like I&#39;m not very versed in this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.620" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">so so you have to explain it to me a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.360" end="00:34:26.850" style="s2">little bit more in layman&#39;s terms you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">know because I because again it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.850" end="00:34:33.149" style="s2">tradition so the logos the logos is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:33.780" style="s2">is the point of entry the point of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.149" end="00:34:35.669" style="s2">contact</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.780" end="00:34:38.490" style="s2">to the numinous that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.669" end="00:34:41.820" style="s2">saying yeah that&#39;s how that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.490" end="00:34:44.370" style="s2">visualize it so in that speech according</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.820" end="00:34:47.690" style="s2">speech or divine thus a divine sacred</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.370" end="00:34:51.470" style="s2">sacred speech or like in some capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.690" end="00:34:58.200" style="s2">language okay yeah so Hebrew has no</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.470" end="00:35:01.380" style="s2">vowels in it it&#39;s all consonants yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.200" end="00:35:03.960" style="s2">there&#39;s an an idea within magic that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.380" end="00:35:05.340" style="s2">have the fundamental represents of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.960" end="00:35:07.830" style="s2">everything that&#39;s just kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.340" end="00:35:11.180" style="s2">undifferentiated white noise and the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.830" end="00:35:13.800" style="s2">a generative process is by adding</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.180" end="00:35:15.060" style="s2">signification or punctuation into that</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.800" end="00:35:19.080" style="s2">white noise and you need to start</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.060" end="00:35:22.200" style="s2">creating structure so the language means</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.080" end="00:35:23.940" style="s2">doing that with sound but go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.200" end="00:35:28.170" style="s2">Cepheid syria it&#39;s number letter and</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.819" end="00:53:31.630" style="s2">would have to I would have to really</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.890" style="s2">think through them together or maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.630" end="00:53:34.990" style="s2">not supposed to understand that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.890" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">they&#39;re just some sort of a transmission</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.990" end="00:53:38.380" style="s2">that I&#39;m not supposed to understand I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:40.150" style="s2">was supposed to just I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.380" end="00:53:46.359" style="s2">register on them them on some subliminal</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.150" end="00:53:50.289" style="s2">level and absorb them that way so that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.359" end="00:53:54.400" style="s2">whole roll back of it it&#39;s gotta be</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.289" end="00:53:58.839" style="s2">close to 20 years ago now doing some</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.400" end="00:54:02.289" style="s2">visionary work on psilocybin and just oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.839" end="00:54:03.910" style="s2">I hit with this vision again the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.289" end="00:54:11.049" style="s2">triangle that&#39;s coming out so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.910" end="00:54:15.880" style="s2">triangle he appeared to me in a flash</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.049" end="00:54:17.960" style="s2">and thunder I am but a stone before that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.880" end="00:54:20.660" style="s2">she that&#39;s your graphic</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.960" end="00:54:22.089" style="s2">that&#39;s the yeah that&#39;s the graphic I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.660" end="00:54:26.260" style="s2">been working on it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.089" end="00:54:29.690" style="s2">generative if you reload it quick it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.260" end="00:54:31.430" style="s2">it was like a lightning bolt aha I see</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.690" end="00:54:35.690" style="s2">yeah yeah when you reloaded it okay so</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.430" end="00:54:38.300" style="s2">you go through and it just kind of blew</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.690" end="00:54:41.240" style="s2">up and those words and then left to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.300" end="00:54:47.210" style="s2">figure it out that was about 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.240" end="00:54:49.670" style="s2">ago that was I was involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.210" end="00:54:51.530" style="s2">pronounced work at that point so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.670" end="00:54:53.660" style="s2">the Paul foster casework but this was</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.530" end="00:54:56.260" style="s2">before I got got involved in mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.660" end="00:54:59.480" style="s2">Freemasonry this vision was part of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.260" end="00:55:02.900" style="s2">led me in that direction was that go</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.480" end="00:55:05.480" style="s2">through paleo the Paleolithic shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.900" end="00:55:07.460" style="s2">follow that forward and then basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.480" end="00:55:11.569" style="s2">go back so most of the modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.460" end="00:55:12.589" style="s2">history traditions live heavily whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.569" end="00:55:16.329" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about any of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.589" end="00:55:19.910" style="s2">charlatans and do like a dilemma or</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.329" end="00:55:20.839" style="s2">ordinary and like most of their most</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.910" end="00:55:23.089" style="s2">these people who started these</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.839" end="00:55:25.240" style="s2">traditions lifted a lot of ritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.089" end="00:55:28.369" style="s2">structure at Freemasons</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.240" end="00:55:31.400" style="s2">so from the rainiest I went into</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.369" end="00:55:33.950" style="s2">traditional brief mastering under the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.400" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">Grand Lodge of Canada reporting under</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.950" end="00:55:40.910" style="s2">the Grand Lodge of England and from</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:43.010" style="s2">there I started poking around with this</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.910" end="00:55:46.700" style="s2">idea like what in human condition is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.010" end="00:55:50.750" style="s2">worthy of being written in stone like</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.700" end="00:55:54.349" style="s2">what survives that test and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.750" end="00:55:58.280" style="s2">taken that on a personal level and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.349" end="00:56:00.170" style="s2">a couple two months ago watching a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.280" end="00:56:01.730" style="s2">YouTube lecture with James Flynn</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.170" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">the guy from the Flynn effect cuts the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.730" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">IQ so Glenn calls himself a moral</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:13.339" style="s2">philosopher who dabbles in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">but the Flynn effect was looking at my</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.339" end="00:56:18.589" style="s2">key studies and basically the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">we&#39;re showing 30 points higher across</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.589" end="00:56:26.119" style="s2">the population that would work years ago</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:28.970" style="s2">mm-hmm up until 1970 and then the Flynn</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.119" end="00:56:32.699" style="s2">effect seems to a theater game and not</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.970" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">just Plateau but started to drop</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.699" end="00:56:39.130" style="s2">Flynn&#39;s premise on this was based off of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:43.149" style="s2">the work of a Russian psychologist named</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.130" end="00:56:44.919" style="s2">Alexander Luria and you know laureate</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.149" end="00:56:46.899" style="s2">went around and asked people different</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.919" end="00:56:50.679" style="s2">types of questions how are efficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.899" end="00:56:53.529" style="s2">across similar they&#39;re not remotely at</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.679" end="00:56:56.819" style="s2">all that&#39;s you know fish swims of water</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.529" end="00:56:56.819" style="s2">crow flies croaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.439" end="00:57:05.919" style="s2">so the end run of Lurie and his stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.289" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">was that he looked three cognitive tool</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.919" end="00:57:11.319" style="s2">sets abstraction with the application of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:15.809" style="s2">logical reasoning treating the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.319" end="00:57:20.409" style="s2">hypothetical as potentially possible and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.809" end="00:57:25.269" style="s2">classification so I something just</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.409" end="00:57:27.669" style="s2">clicked with that I know I can be an</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.269" end="00:57:30.099" style="s2">arrogant prick so sometimes I think I</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.669" end="00:57:35.409" style="s2">hear he calls himself up being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.099" end="00:57:39.009" style="s2">arrogant I&#39;ll just say straight up</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.409" end="00:57:41.109" style="s2"> stupid people especially in</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.009" end="00:57:42.459" style="s2">positions of business or power it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.109" end="00:57:45.729" style="s2">mind boggling like how do you get here</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.459" end="00:57:47.739" style="s2">when you get tired she used but instead</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.729" end="00:57:50.289" style="s2">of sitting in that kind of arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.739" end="00:57:52.509" style="s2">like rolled down what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.289" end="00:57:56.949" style="s2">actually going on in the broken thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.509" end="00:57:58.179" style="s2">and really mmm these tool sets I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.949" end="00:58:01.959" style="s2">nothing&#39;s changed in the biological</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.179" end="00:58:04.089" style="s2">substrate in 100 years but the market so</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.959" end="00:58:05.259" style="s2">I see it tie here between what Pearson</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.089" end="00:58:07.089" style="s2">was talking about the head start program</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.259" end="00:58:10.059" style="s2">in the 60s where they&#39;re trying to raise</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.089" end="00:58:10.449" style="s2">people up school program things like</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.059" end="00:58:13.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.449" end="00:58:16.239" style="s2">mmm-hmm you know the end run was that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.719" end="00:58:18.669" style="s2">didn&#39;t really work other than the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.239" end="00:58:22.239" style="s2">the kids who were better socialized it</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.669" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">did better but I think in certain in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.239" end="00:58:28.149" style="s2">same context on a social remediation</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:31.269" style="s2">having access to effective cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.149" end="00:58:32.199" style="s2">tool sets that mean once all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.269" end="00:58:36.459" style="s2">difference in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.199" end="00:58:39.369" style="s2">like I&#39;m cuz I learn all the on my</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.459" end="00:58:41.739" style="s2">own and dig pretty hard to find it out</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.369" end="00:58:43.509" style="s2">whereas you know some these tools should</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.739" end="00:58:44.810" style="s2">be available for people like take</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.509" end="00:58:47.840" style="s2">something like the John Howard</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.810" end="00:58:49.340" style="s2">xiety and their conflict resolution or</p>

<p begin="00:58:57.290" end="00:59:05.810" style="s2">through high school yeah it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.630" end="00:59:08.540" style="s2">staggering how how education is stagnant</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.810" end="00:59:11.150" style="s2">I think like yeah I mean it ties into</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.540" end="00:59:13.670" style="s2">the what the resentments I had in terms</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.150" end="00:59:16.520" style="s2">is Christianity in terms of its kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.670" end="00:59:19.490" style="s2">look down your nose holier-than-thou</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.520" end="00:59:21.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s useless it</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.490" end="00:59:24.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t remediate anything you need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.530" end="00:59:26.030" style="s2">give people meaningful tools and space</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.350" end="00:59:31.310" style="s2">to learn how to use them if you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.030" end="00:59:33.260" style="s2">see actual change mm-hmm so I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.310" end="00:59:36.080" style="s2">degree that&#39;s where I think the free</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.260" end="00:59:40.900" style="s2">Minister comes in to at least out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.080" end="00:59:42.890" style="s2">pattern levels so sets of working tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.900" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">like cognitive working tools so</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.890" end="00:59:49.010" style="s2">cognitive working chose chose to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:52.070" style="s2">people more intelligent in a sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.010" end="00:59:53.330" style="s2">just it&#39;s a better toolkit that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.070" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">carrying around with them and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.330" end="00:59:56.900" style="s2">again the biological substrate has not</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="00:59:58.940" style="s2">changed but if you give to people better</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.900" end="01:00:01.670" style="s2">tools after the start I&#39;m gonna do a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.940" end="01:00:04.370" style="s2">hell of a lot better and so that was</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.670" end="01:00:06.470" style="s2">kind of the old separation between you</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.370" end="01:00:09.590" style="s2">know upstairs and downstairs was the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.470" end="01:00:11.090" style="s2">Downton Abbey model upstairs always</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.590" end="01:00:12.890" style="s2">figured you know it was better because</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.090" end="01:00:15.230" style="s2">you know he can see the difference in</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.890" end="01:00:17.480" style="s2">these people because they didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.230" end="01:00:21.590" style="s2">have all those things there and we start</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.480" end="01:00:24.110" style="s2">to do a moralistic like no four</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.590" end="01:00:27.830" style="s2">forks and knives and spoons on the table</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.110" end="01:00:29.330" style="s2">just to show or humiliate the people you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.830" end="01:00:30.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to pick them up in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.330" end="01:00:34.310" style="s2">right order like that&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.800" end="01:00:36.340" style="s2">meaningful differentiation at a social</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.310" end="01:00:36.340" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.290" end="01:00:47.240" style="s2">it was the fling the idea of those three</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.450" end="01:00:50.360" style="s2">domains of cognitive development so</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.240" end="01:00:53.030" style="s2">abstraction great useless if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.360" end="01:00:54.440" style="s2">apply logical reasoning logical</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.030" end="01:00:55.760" style="s2">reasoning isn&#39;t very good without the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.440" end="01:00:57.290" style="s2">abstraction either to start to get you</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.760" end="01:00:58.170" style="s2">into accretion and bureaucracy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.290" end="01:01:02.190" style="s2">sweet side</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.170" end="01:01:04.200" style="s2">a hypothetical well people are either</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.190" end="01:01:06.150" style="s2">Chicken Little the sky is falling or</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.200" end="01:01:12.450" style="s2">just like nothing to see here</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.150" end="01:01:15.870" style="s2">I don&#39;t see anything and classification</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.450" end="01:01:17.990" style="s2">I mean again that&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.870" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">resolution issue that Petersons looks</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.990" end="01:01:22.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s okay to have these short forms</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.150" style="s2">but you need to understand when the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.440" end="01:01:27.000" style="s2">short form is just the short form and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.150" end="01:01:32.610" style="s2">this is actually a whole domain of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.000" end="01:01:36.560" style="s2">behind it short form meaning just</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.610" end="01:01:40.440" style="s2">abstraction right like or you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.560" end="01:01:44.340" style="s2">map not being the territory yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.440" end="01:01:46.560" style="s2">exactly yeah that&#39;s what I find about</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.340" end="01:01:48.300" style="s2">you know Harris&#39;s like okay she&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.560" end="01:01:57.300" style="s2">to make the entire East right okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.300" end="01:01:59.730" style="s2">yeah rational abstraction being you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.300" end="01:02:02.550" style="s2">the answer to all human human you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.730" end="01:02:03.960" style="s2">problems it doesn&#39;t cut it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.550" end="01:02:07.620" style="s2">you&#39;re making a map as big as the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.960" end="01:02:14.700" style="s2">all right it&#39;s just it doesn&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.620" end="01:02:16.650" style="s2">the depth the depth right yeah and what</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.700" end="01:02:21.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to do with Safra been I</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.650" end="01:02:23.250" style="s2">guess is take all his personal journey</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.060" end="01:02:25.040" style="s2">stuff and turned it into an open-source</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.250" end="01:02:28.250" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.040" end="01:02:31.460" style="s2">good no bird search monologue so he said</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.250" end="01:02:34.700" style="s2">an open source model so I don&#39;t beside</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.460" end="01:02:39.750" style="s2">besides the texts that I&#39;m running as</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.700" end="01:02:42.390" style="s2">the you know the 1.0 version for</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.750" end="01:02:44.280" style="s2">feedback and criticism so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.390" end="01:02:47.400" style="s2">texts aspect of it that&#39;s broken down</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.280" end="01:02:49.620" style="s2">into box and very bus so the box would</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.400" end="01:02:51.420" style="s2">be you know this he appeared to me in</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.620" end="01:02:54.300" style="s2">flash and thunder that was actually like</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.420" end="01:02:57.470" style="s2">a personal transmission to use the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.300" end="01:03:00.300" style="s2">phrase address in action mystical space</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.470" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">where everything else is the verbo or</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.300" end="01:03:05.840" style="s2">like the commentary the the literal</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:09.320" style="s2">voice versus speaking in the voice of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.840" end="01:03:09.320" style="s2">christian tradition</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.680" end="01:03:15.840" style="s2">the second part of that is to build some</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.470" end="01:03:17.940" style="s2">visualization tools of around the Big</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.840" end="01:03:19.740" style="s2">Five personality stuff so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.940" end="01:03:23.250" style="s2">couple of sites like open psychometrics</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.740" end="01:03:25.350" style="s2">org that have datasets I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.250" end="01:03:29.090" style="s2">interesting at the big five and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.350" end="01:03:31.650" style="s2">population great five what Big Bite</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.090" end="01:03:33.210" style="s2">population data I&#39;m looking at the big</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.650" end="01:03:36.869" style="s2">five and a context in poverty you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.210" end="01:03:37.500" style="s2">I&#39;m more of the subgroups breakout and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.869" end="01:03:42.270" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.500" end="01:03:44.490" style="s2">no so part of its this you know trans</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.270" end="01:03:45.780" style="s2">with trans me mention around mystical</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.490" end="01:03:48.570" style="s2">experience and then the other part is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.780" end="01:03:52.350" style="s2">set of tools being able to actually dig</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.570" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">into some of the stuff and look at</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.350" end="01:03:57.570" style="s2">yourself over time like Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:04:00.530" style="s2">about the micro skills develop a little</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.570" end="01:04:04.080" style="s2">bit and I don&#39;t think people are as</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.530" end="01:04:06.600" style="s2">fixed as we project I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.080" end="01:04:09.000" style="s2">lot of room for growth across all of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.600" end="01:04:13.170" style="s2">personality dimensions yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.000" end="01:04:17.280" style="s2">that was that was my initial misgiving</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.170" end="01:04:20.520" style="s2">about this this is like okay how fixed</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.280" end="01:04:21.990" style="s2">is the human personality and it depends</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.520" end="01:04:23.820" style="s2">on how much you want to work apparently</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.990" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">you just you just you to eat a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.820" end="01:04:29.670" style="s2">cell a7 suicide then psilocybin</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:31.560" style="s2">mushrooms and then you can you can you</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.670" end="01:04:35.369" style="s2">can increase openness one standard</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.560" end="01:04:38.520" style="s2">deviation or or whatever so so so</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.369" end="01:04:41.700" style="s2">obviously there are methods to seriously</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.520" end="01:04:42.900" style="s2">change the personality although it seems</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.700" end="01:04:45.780" style="s2">quite rare</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.900" end="01:04:48.930" style="s2">the people are in contact with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.780" end="01:04:50.010" style="s2">these methods if people have liked some</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.930" end="01:04:51.450" style="s2">of the some of the likes things</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.010" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">sometimes some of the practices I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.450" end="01:04:57.060" style="s2">done in Buddhism are extremely physical</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:59.790" style="s2">right it&#39;s like yeah and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.060" end="01:05:02.040" style="s2">people are aware that how that these</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.790" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">practices exist and they can change you</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.040" end="01:05:07.560" style="s2">to a radical extent you know maybe if I</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:09.630" style="s2">did and I could do some other kind of I</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.560" end="01:05:11.160" style="s2">could go in a cave somewhere and do it</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.630" end="01:05:13.619" style="s2">some other kind of practice for a year</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.160" end="01:05:17.100" style="s2">and I could develop this other you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.619" end="01:05:19.410" style="s2">I could develop this other visionary</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.100" end="01:05:21.370" style="s2">ability but you know which would change</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.410" end="01:05:23.860" style="s2">my personality but</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.370" end="01:05:28.530" style="s2">but then again most most of us kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.860" end="01:05:31.270" style="s2">remain sort of we don&#39;t change that much</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.530" end="01:05:34.180" style="s2">well people get fairly static in their</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.270" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">habituation and they don&#39;t its ticularly</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.180" end="01:05:38.830" style="s2">comfort zone they don&#39;t push it as much</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s it&#39;s very rare to find</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.830" end="01:05:44.080" style="s2">people who engage with that innately</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:46.510" style="s2">most people won&#39;t dig into that</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.080" end="01:05:48.760" style="s2">transformative space until trauma forces</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.510" end="01:05:50.670" style="s2">them to right it&#39;s a drama until crisis</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.760" end="01:05:57.400" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s certainly my case I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.670" end="01:05:59.950" style="s2">crisis is it&#39;s just you know craft being</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.400" end="01:06:01.840" style="s2">becoming dissembled becoming destroyed</p>

<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:33.970" style="s2">on the world you know they might they</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.530" end="01:07:34.600" style="s2">might be having an enormous effect in</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.970" end="01:07:37.810" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.600" end="01:07:43.960" style="s2">in some subtle way that you know we</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.810" end="01:07:47.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know but but but I couldn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.960" end="01:07:50.260" style="s2">about them in a public space and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.580" end="01:07:51.850" style="s2">couldn&#39;t talk about I couldn&#39;t talk</p>

<p begin="01:07:53.560" end="01:07:57.640" style="s2">deep because those people first of all</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.140" end="01:08:01.540" style="s2">are not interested in being public</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.640" end="01:08:03.100" style="s2">figures probably and and second of all</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.540" end="01:08:07.810" style="s2">that nobody would know what the hell I</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.100" end="01:08:10.300" style="s2">was talking about I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.810" end="01:08:13.990" style="s2">the problem with Peterson he covers so</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.300" end="01:08:15.940" style="s2">much material in breath that you know a</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.990" end="01:08:18.520" style="s2">lot of people are picking up two three</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.940" end="01:08:21.670" style="s2">out of ten and there aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.520" end="01:08:23.320" style="s2">seeing the whole picture so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.670" end="01:08:26.100" style="s2">making it really grossly misinformed</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.320" end="01:08:30.190" style="s2">assumptions of what it is exactly saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.100" end="01:08:32.710" style="s2">yeah yeah a real lack of willingness</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.190" end="01:08:35.020" style="s2">yeah and I guess it&#39;s just human nature</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.710" end="01:08:39.190" style="s2">right to me to make a cult of something</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.020" end="01:08:41.830" style="s2">right like yeah I mean there&#39;s a hole to</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.190" end="01:08:43.660" style="s2">make it to make a to make a cult of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.830" end="01:08:46.480" style="s2">most superficial aspects of the thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.660" end="01:08:49.300" style="s2">right yeah instead of reading maps of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.480" end="01:08:51.130" style="s2">meaning and you know and getting going</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.300" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">into the depth of that people are</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.130" end="01:08:56.830" style="s2">getting it the most superficial</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:59.290" style="s2">political stuff which is the least</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.830" end="01:09:00.910" style="s2">interesting and if you see then while</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.290" end="01:09:02.830" style="s2">you see that from the Facebook groups</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.910" end="01:09:05.880" style="s2">that stuff as well like I was in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.830" end="01:09:08.170" style="s2">boat party fairly early upon it like</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.880" end="01:09:11.470" style="s2">it&#39;s the worst of the worst of all</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.170" end="01:09:13.540" style="s2">low-risk conversations oh well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.470" end="01:09:15.580" style="s2">really have I don&#39;t really have Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.540" end="01:09:17.620" style="s2">conversations anymore I&#39;ve just stopped</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.580" end="01:09:20.890" style="s2">doing it because I found that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.620" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">people even like you know I can almost</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.890" end="01:09:23.830" style="s2">apologize to you because you wrote me a</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:27.070" style="s2">bunch of stuff in that and I just I</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.830" end="01:09:30.130" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t respond to Facebook to</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.070" end="01:09:31.270" style="s2">chatting anymore I don&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.130" end="01:09:33.790" style="s2">I want to do this kind of thing right</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.270" end="01:09:34.440" style="s2">because this is so much this is this</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.790" end="01:09:37.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.440" end="01:09:38.790" style="s2">is such a it&#39;s so much of a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.440" end="01:09:41.910" style="s2">dimension having a real conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.790" end="01:09:43.980" style="s2">than having a text conversation and all</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.910" end="01:09:47.250" style="s2">these text conversations leaves the</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.980" end="01:09:50.400" style="s2">misunderstanding and animosity and gross</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.250" end="01:09:52.529" style="s2">you know reactive react so I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:55.440" style="s2">I become allergic to chatting you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.529" end="01:09:58.710" style="s2">in text and I think chatting in text is</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.440" end="01:10:01.110" style="s2">almost a it&#39;s it&#39;s like a the reason all</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.710" end="01:10:02.880" style="s2">this long-form conversation is suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.110" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">becoming appealing and people are into</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:10.410" style="s2">that is because this chatting in text</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:14.040" style="s2">has become so toxic and that people</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.410" end="01:10:16.199" style="s2">people you know or like you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.040" end="01:10:19.770" style="s2">been having them Curt buy that in some</p>
