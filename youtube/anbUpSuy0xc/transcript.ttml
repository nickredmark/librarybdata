<p begin="00:02:57.320" end="00:03:04.910" style="s2">podcasting you have to say stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.900" end="00:03:06.410" style="s2">the lady in New Mexico she told me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.910" end="00:03:07.930" style="s2">she had met with the head of the law</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.410" end="00:03:10.160" style="s2">school and then she had met with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.930" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">security there and they were told that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.160" end="00:03:14.900" style="s2">there was like gonna be a security</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:16.760" style="s2">threats some sort of danger or risk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.900" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">the people who may be attending my talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.760" end="00:03:21.140" style="s2">which is crazy isn&#39;t well like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:23.630" style="s2">we know people that are far more</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.140" end="00:03:27.080" style="s2">outrageous and provocative than I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.630" end="00:03:28.730" style="s2">right I mean part of how the lift</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.080" end="00:03:31.220" style="s2">operates I guess now is that they just</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.730" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">come out they threaten you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.220" end="00:03:34.220" style="s2">how they bully these administration&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.230" style="s2">which probably didn&#39;t want to host you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:38.120" style="s2">in the beginning from hosting you they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.230" end="00:03:40.160" style="s2">give you they create a pretext right</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.120" end="00:03:42.440" style="s2">because if you know if a popular</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.160" end="00:03:44.600" style="s2">left-wing speaker was coming to speak at</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.440" end="00:03:47.269" style="s2">the at the University of New Mexico law</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.600" end="00:03:48.980" style="s2">school and some right winger came out</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.269" end="00:03:51.019" style="s2">and threatened them do you really think</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.980" end="00:03:53.540" style="s2">that New Mexico would ban that speaker</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.019" end="00:03:54.860" style="s2">no odds are extremely low right no they</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.540" end="00:03:57.050" style="s2">would just tell that protester just to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.860" end="00:03:59.780" style="s2">go home and be quiet about it because</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.050" end="00:04:02.750" style="s2">hey free speech right so we would go out</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.780" end="00:04:04.820" style="s2">there anyway right the head of security</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.750" end="00:04:06.920" style="s2">says no the head of the law school says</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.820" end="00:04:09.470" style="s2">no they canceled the event one day</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.920" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">before and they cite because it was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.470" end="00:04:13.459" style="s2">the day before midterm elections and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:15.500" style="s2">they cite oh it&#39;s too dangerous to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.459" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">these conversations right before midterm</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:18.389" style="s2">elections does that right that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:19.799" style="s2">like I&#39;m in America</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.389" end="00:04:21.560" style="s2">I know it sounds like you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.799" end="00:04:23.610" style="s2">engaging an election meddling Jack</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.560" end="00:04:26.249" style="s2">sounds like we need a special counsel</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.610" end="00:04:27.779" style="s2">investigation just for you right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.249" end="00:04:29.550" style="s2">I know you know the truth is is that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.779" end="00:04:31.319" style="s2">think that my subject matter isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.550" end="00:04:32.909" style="s2">really that provocative definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.319" end="00:04:34.229" style="s2">definitely not what&#39;s in the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.909" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">Democrat to the pleura ball I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.229" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem provocative to me but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:40.289" style="s2">some of the older stuff you know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">happens they start googling right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.289" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">there are hit pieces out there on me</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2">that just won&#39;t go away the search</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">engine optimization is pretty good and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a good platform power so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.199" style="s2">people will start googling and then all</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:53.969" style="s2">of a sudden it&#39;s like oh this guy can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.199" end="00:04:57.689" style="s2">come and then free speech is in jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.969" end="00:05:01.949" style="s2">and that&#39;s that but the Google problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.689" end="00:05:04.740" style="s2">is one that essentially it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.949" end="00:05:06.779" style="s2">part of it&#39;s part of the broader warfare</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.740" end="00:05:08.699" style="s2">right it only works because the left has</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.779" end="00:05:10.589" style="s2">so much dominant cultural power I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.699" end="00:05:13.229" style="s2">thinking about this the other day we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.589" end="00:05:15.150" style="s2">really just this morning that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.229" end="00:05:16.650" style="s2">people who support Trump and support the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.150" end="00:05:18.839" style="s2">president they&#39;re the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.650" end="00:05:20.909" style="s2">vulnerable to being deep platformed</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.839" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">people who oppose the president are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.909" end="00:05:24.900" style="s2">vulnerable to being deep platformed now</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:27.689" style="s2">in a world where Republicans were as</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:29.099" style="s2">powerful as left often to thinks of them</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.599" end="00:05:52.469" style="s2">power asymmetry and it also made me</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.399" end="00:05:53.879" style="s2">think that if the right actually had</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.879" end="00:05:59.189" style="s2">does the left would never win an</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.189" end="00:06:03.300" style="s2">well and they they act like the exact</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">opposite is true right right like</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.300" end="00:06:06.870" style="s2">Republicans and people that that support</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.229" end="00:06:18.750" style="s2">may be but the truth is is that from</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.459" end="00:06:36.599" style="s2">it differently because part of their</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.959" end="00:06:57.690" style="s2">no money for Trump and there really</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.099" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a lot of money for Republican</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.690" end="00:07:03.060" style="s2">candidates this cycle there was tons of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:04.589" style="s2">money for Democratic candidates and the</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.589" end="00:07:10.229" style="s2">2016 moved a lot of delete coastal</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.190" end="00:07:11.699" style="s2">Republicans to Democrats to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.229" end="00:07:13.589" style="s2">Democratic side and the trade-off is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.699" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">that we now have a chance of a fighting</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.589" end="00:07:16.229" style="s2">chance of winning the Rust Belt and a</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.229" end="00:07:19.769" style="s2">presidency but the downside is we have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.330" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">lot less money to do it with than we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.769" end="00:07:24.149" style="s2">used to us are as like a Republican</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:26.069" style="s2">Party and it also means that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.149" end="00:07:28.769" style="s2">power is much more consolidated with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.069" end="00:07:30.449" style="s2">Democrats because they not only have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.769" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">cultural power that comes from Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.449" end="00:07:34.949" style="s2">in academia David they now have the</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.870" end="00:07:40.979" style="s2">and their periodicals things like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.819" end="00:07:42.779" style="s2">Weekly Standard and you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.979" end="00:07:44.569" style="s2">people who were on CNN and being really</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.779" end="00:07:47.370" style="s2">annoying</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.569" end="00:07:49.889" style="s2">well one thing that it struck me in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.370" end="00:07:51.060" style="s2">less of the midterms with the Texas</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.889" end="00:07:54.060" style="s2">campaign for Senate</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.060" end="00:07:55.830" style="s2">apparently some unheard of amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.060" end="00:07:58.289" style="s2">money out of state money flowed into</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.830" end="00:08:00.719" style="s2">Texas to try to influence the Senate the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.289" end="00:08:03.959" style="s2">Senate campaign right and I started to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.719" end="00:08:06.779" style="s2">think when we&#39;re talking about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.959" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">of Russian influence and outside</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.779" end="00:08:12.569" style="s2">meddling on the national politicking</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:14.849" style="s2">scene how is that not analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.569" end="00:08:17.189" style="s2">outside money from us outside of a state</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.849" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">flowing into a state to try to sway</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.360" style="s2">live in that state and who don&#39;t vote in</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.379" end="00:08:26.669" style="s2">that state and our domiciled in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.360" end="00:08:28.490" style="s2">state there it&#39;s like literal actual out</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.669" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">of jurisdiction metal</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.490" end="00:08:32.570" style="s2">in an election I&#39;m sure and mean as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:35.450" style="s2">as the media&#39;s decision to just drown</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.570" end="00:08:38.300" style="s2">everybody in coverage of beta or orc and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.450" end="00:08:40.580" style="s2">ignore his flaws which are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.300" end="00:08:43.669" style="s2">profound I mean the dude had a DUI and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.580" end="00:08:47.240" style="s2">not just any DUI like a DUI and hit run</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.669" end="00:08:48.589" style="s2">you know in his late 20s I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.240" end="00:08:50.270" style="s2">the time period that&#39;s not that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.589" end="00:08:53.390" style="s2">you know that for him for him he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.270" end="00:08:55.690" style="s2">younger guy and then you had people like</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:07.520" style="s2">in a rough cycle for Republicans into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.899" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">state that&#39;s generally been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.520" end="00:09:11.690" style="s2">democratic you cently you know we lost</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:15.020" style="s2">by like five zero coverage from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.690" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">mainstream media and that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.020" end="00:09:21.290" style="s2">gives you and and so from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:23.029" style="s2">like you getting D platformed</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.290" end="00:09:24.649" style="s2">at New Mexico and it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.029" end="00:09:27.620" style="s2">broader theme of conservatives finding</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.649" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">themselves D platformed in academia is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.620" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">part of the broader theme of the media</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.610" end="00:09:35.750" style="s2">completely differently which is all a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:38.120" style="s2">part of this broad cultural power the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.750" end="00:09:40.610" style="s2">Democrats can bring to bear and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.120" end="00:09:43.270" style="s2">Republicans currently can&#39;t well and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.610" end="00:09:45.589" style="s2">what strikes me as being particularly</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.270" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">nefarious is that I&#39;m actually out here</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.589" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">trying to build bridges like I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.020" end="00:09:53.149" style="s2">to help people understand how you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:55.339" style="s2">have a political realignment or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.149" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">culture awakening but also trying to use</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:01.100" style="s2">sides to try to bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">can&#39;t do that that&#39;s still a fad right I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">think that&#39;s you buddy if you bring</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:05.149" style="s2">everyone together then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:07.430" style="s2">victims there&#39;s no oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.149" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">they have no mission right so I&#39;m out</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.430" end="00:10:10.670" style="s2">here building bridges and people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">trying to tear me down and that should</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.670" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">tell you a lot about where we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:15.889" style="s2">in this our current</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.889" end="00:10:19.699" style="s2">it&#39;s possible in the next two years we</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:21.529" style="s2">will be because maybe Pelosi and trumps</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.699" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">start working together like oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.529" end="00:10:25.910" style="s2">I after Pelosi speech in the aftermath</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">of the midterms I was like I hope she&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.629" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">which would be unbelievably good for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.459" end="00:10:34.370" style="s2">overall social climate right if</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.139" style="s2">Democrats in Congress work together with</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.370" end="00:10:37.310" style="s2">Republicans in the Senate and Trump and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.139" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2">actually passed a few pieces of</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.110" end="00:12:53.310" style="s2">Vikings coming ok so here are some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.019" end="00:12:55.470" style="s2">the topics that we&#39;re gonna try to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.310" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">to today we&#39;re gonna get to nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.470" end="00:13:01.769" style="s2">versus globalism and patriotism where</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:04.740" style="s2">that all fits in there and what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.769" end="00:13:07.560" style="s2">is there such a thing as nationalism or</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.740" end="00:13:08.670" style="s2">libertarian nationalists that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.560" end="00:13:11.430" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve been thinking quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.670" end="00:13:14.100" style="s2">a lot a lot about actually I went to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.430" end="00:13:16.769" style="s2">George Mason for economics undergrad so</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.100" end="00:13:18.810" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty well steeped in libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.769" end="00:13:22.250" style="s2">market-based thinking but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.810" end="00:13:26.449" style="s2">toying with this idea like how what if</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.250" end="00:13:29.910" style="s2">do these values end at a border and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.449" end="00:13:32.250" style="s2">borders real or abstract and should they</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.910" end="00:13:34.769" style="s2">impact the the way that markets work and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.250" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">the way your morality is applied to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.769" end="00:13:38.189" style="s2">other human beings so we&#39;re gonna get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.230" end="00:13:40.889" style="s2">that but the first thing I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.189" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">about is this this nationalism versus</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.889" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">global or something that&#39;s in the news</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:45.720" style="s2">right now so why don&#39;t you sort of get</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">us all up to speed and describe what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.720" end="00:13:49.380" style="s2">been what&#39;s been happening so I think it</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:53.029" style="s2">was either yesterday or the day before</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.380" end="00:13:56.579" style="s2">probably yesterday where Emmanuel macron</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.029" end="00:13:58.500" style="s2">the Prime Minister of France got up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.579" end="00:14:00.569" style="s2">said that nationalism was treason that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:02.490" style="s2">it was the opposite of patriotism and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.569" end="00:14:03.930" style="s2">said that while Trump was sitting right</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.490" end="00:14:05.699" style="s2">there at the audience and Trump had</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.930" end="00:14:07.889" style="s2">famously declared himself to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.699" end="00:14:11.670" style="s2">nationalist about three weeks ago at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.889" end="00:14:14.220" style="s2">rally and this this criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.670" end="00:14:15.720" style="s2">nationalism feeds off of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.220" end="00:14:17.490" style="s2">American criticisms people like Bill</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.720" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">Kristol but a whole bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:36.920" style="s2">but at the same time you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.779" end="00:15:39.829" style="s2">interesting to think how many people do</p>

<p begin="00:15:45.620" end="00:15:49.790" style="s2">population in general so I&#39;m oh I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.510" end="00:15:51.410" style="s2">making a sexist comment or even a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.790" end="00:15:53.149" style="s2">class&#39;s comment it was really a just</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.410" end="00:15:54.440" style="s2">because I&#39;m really an ageist and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.149" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">fair most of the time I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.440" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">pretty frustrated by like kids in their</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:15:59.899" style="s2">early 20s because I know what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">in my early 20s it&#39;s totally different</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.899" end="00:16:04.550" style="s2">from what I think today ten years later</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:06.500" style="s2">right it was really stupid right and but</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.550" end="00:16:07.760" style="s2">with much more competence oh yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.500" end="00:16:10.040" style="s2">super confident that I had figured out</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.760" end="00:16:11.959" style="s2">role politics just completely figured it</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.040" end="00:16:14.060" style="s2">out I like anybody just listened to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.959" end="00:16:15.560" style="s2">right like we should have ceased heads</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.060" end="00:16:18.589" style="s2">in the middle of the ocean to compete</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.560" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">with governments so that they can so</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.589" end="00:16:21.410" style="s2">that they can put competitive pressure</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.410" end="00:16:25.490" style="s2">citizens better I genuinely thought that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.029" end="00:16:27.560" style="s2">was like the solution to politics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.490" end="00:16:30.020" style="s2">so simple you guys you mean just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.560" end="00:16:31.220" style="s2">living on an abandoned oil platform yeah</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.039" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">soulish yeah you know and just something</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.140" end="00:19:55.649" style="s2">immoral and unethical we have to help</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:05.580" style="s2">also just a sort of like why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.779" end="00:20:07.230" style="s2">care about your own family you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.580" end="00:20:08.549" style="s2">even on a basic level I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.230" end="00:20:10.289" style="s2">probably had this experience I&#39;ve had it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.549" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">with you know personal issues to my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.289" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">family where I&#39;ve had very close</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:16.380" style="s2">relations kind of distanced themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">from me as a result of just being</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.380" end="00:20:20.070" style="s2">involved in right-wing politics and I in</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.070" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">this appalling mhm and it&#39;s like why do</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.110" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">we find that so intuitively appalling</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:27.330" style="s2">because well obviously you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:29.130" style="s2">to care most about your family they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.330" end="00:20:31.110" style="s2">most about you know that&#39;s that&#39;s blood</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.110" end="00:20:35.549" style="s2">supposed to care so presumably these</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.330" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">globalists have their own tribe right</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.549" end="00:20:39.960" style="s2">their own family that they&#39;re presuming</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">to care about who&#39;s that I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.960" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">they I&#39;m not sure I mean they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:45.690" style="s2">the difference between their explicit</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:47.610" style="s2">remarks and their implicit behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.690" end="00:20:49.559" style="s2">right so the explicit remarks are their</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.610" end="00:20:51.809" style="s2">family there isn&#39;t they&#39;re not caring</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.559" end="00:20:54.390" style="s2">more about the citizens and non-citizens</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.809" end="00:20:55.890" style="s2">right there but they are very very</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.390" end="00:20:58.500" style="s2">deeply caring about the rights of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.890" end="00:21:00.090" style="s2">other and that&#39;s part of signaling about</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.500" end="00:21:04.890" style="s2">their is that&#39;s a way of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.090" end="00:21:08.190" style="s2">virtue implicitly they end up caring</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.890" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">most about the people who agree with</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.190" end="00:21:13.080" style="s2">them politically right and so that ends</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:14.730" style="s2">up being the core in-group that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.080" end="00:21:16.919" style="s2">truly defend and hold to a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.730" end="00:21:17.880" style="s2">standard than everybody else right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.919" end="00:21:19.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like are there</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.880" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">financial interest power interest</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.650" end="00:21:23.310" style="s2">control things like that that bind those</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.170" style="s2">people together and it&#39;s out why no I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.310" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">I&#39;m not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nearly that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.170" end="00:21:31.410" style="s2">pragmatic or or sort of like hard-headed</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:33.660" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s why people</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.410" end="00:21:35.430" style="s2">like why the left kind of stays together</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.660" end="00:21:37.140" style="s2">in that way they&#39;re not there&#39;s not some</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.140" end="00:21:40.830" style="s2">kind of like we want the money we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.760" end="00:21:43.050" style="s2">the oil motivation I I genuinely think</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.830" end="00:21:44.340" style="s2">these people are you know how about what</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.050" end="00:21:46.380" style="s2">they definitely see as a higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.340" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">motivation than that which is you know</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.170" end="00:21:59.880" style="s2">person who signals properly that you do</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.240" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">those things then you end up being part</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.880" end="00:22:03.570" style="s2">of the in-group that does effectively</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:05.490" style="s2">get treated that way because I guess</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.570" end="00:22:07.140" style="s2">another point to be made is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.490" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">always going to be some sort of in-group</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.140" end="00:22:12.390" style="s2">whose interests you prioritize over the</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.580" end="00:22:23.580" style="s2">me where does that come from I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.050" end="00:22:25.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s because we&#39;re tribal</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.580" end="00:22:27.480" style="s2">tribal and animals that are used to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.170" end="00:22:29.370" style="s2">living in small groups right and here we</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.480" end="00:22:31.230" style="s2">are now interfacing you know instead of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.370" end="00:22:33.270" style="s2">with 30 to 50 people we&#39;re interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.230" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">with like seven billion people right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.270" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">so it&#39;s good natural tendency to find</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:39.240" style="s2">you find your own tribe and find your</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:40.920" style="s2">own group and you have your own end</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.240" end="00:22:43.350" style="s2">group and I think that&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.920" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2">instinct that plays itself out on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.350" end="00:22:48.360" style="s2">political spectrum on all sides it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:50.130" style="s2">just that I guess in this question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.360" end="00:22:51.900" style="s2">you know is your in-group gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.130" end="00:22:53.220" style="s2">people that live next door to you or is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.900" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">your in-group couldn&#39;t be people that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.220" end="00:22:56.460" style="s2">are living on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:22:58.050" style="s2">planet right and then I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:22:59.190" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be the people who live on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.050" end="00:23:00.780" style="s2">other side of the planet and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.190" end="00:23:02.940" style="s2">that it&#39;s just it&#39;s not moral to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.780" end="00:23:05.370" style="s2">your to ignore those closest to you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.940" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">then and then it&#39;s probably like think</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.370" end="00:23:08.430" style="s2">all the time that your moral because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.170" style="s2">care about the interests of those in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.430" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">sub-saharan Africa I just don&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.170" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">saying that you shouldn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">people in southern certain it&#39;s here in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.930" style="s2">Africa yeah I think if you should but</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:17.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like having concentric circles of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.930" end="00:23:20.280" style="s2">caring in these as they expand outward</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.790" end="00:23:22.560" style="s2">they be those bonds become less strong</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.280" end="00:23:24.510" style="s2">right well and you know that that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.560" end="00:23:25.890" style="s2">of my model for self-improvement and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.510" end="00:23:27.330" style="s2">development to which is take care of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.890" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">yourself first that&#39;s your number one</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.330" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">priority</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.250" style="s2">take care of your body take care of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:34.679" style="s2">mind get enough sleep get enough food</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.250" end="00:23:37.049" style="s2">get enough to eat and it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.679" end="00:23:38.460" style="s2">of a selfish reason we&#39;re like I love</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.049" end="00:23:40.049" style="s2">myself the most so I&#39;m gonna take care</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:42.029" style="s2">of myself that way no it&#39;s so that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.049" end="00:23:43.740" style="s2">can be a better utility to the people</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.029" end="00:23:45.330" style="s2">who are around you so you can be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.740" end="00:23:47.159" style="s2">better and higher greater used to your</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.330" end="00:23:48.659" style="s2">media family and then if you get that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.159" end="00:23:50.789" style="s2">taken care of then your community a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.659" end="00:23:52.200" style="s2">little bit broader maybe your nation</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.789" end="00:23:54.120" style="s2">maybe the world but if you spend your</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.200" end="00:23:57.510" style="s2">time worrying about the nation and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.120" end="00:23:59.789" style="s2">world first then your internal you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.510" end="00:24:02.460" style="s2">yourself your individual self is going</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.789" end="00:24:05.330" style="s2">to suffer for it and I think that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.460" end="00:24:09.720" style="s2">of where the nationalism globalism</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.330" end="00:24:11.490" style="s2">debate is really falling right now is is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.720" end="00:24:13.470" style="s2">it possible to be concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.490" end="00:24:15.899" style="s2">welfare of people outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.470" end="00:24:18.120" style="s2">in-group outside of your nation-state as</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.899" end="00:24:21.299" style="s2">a priority and then still maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.120" end="00:24:23.549" style="s2">independent inherent value and strength</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.299" end="00:24:25.799" style="s2">of yourself as individual or your</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.549" end="00:24:27.360" style="s2">nation-state as an individual and to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.799" end="00:24:29.429" style="s2">it&#39;s insane that this is even like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:32.700" style="s2">real question how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.429" end="00:24:35.669" style="s2">think that this idea of taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.700" end="00:24:38.610" style="s2">your your own citizens with your own</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.669" end="00:24:41.250" style="s2">national interests first how did that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.610" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">become a pejorative and where where and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.250" end="00:24:45.840" style="s2">when do you know I mean maybe we&#39;d none</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:47.159" style="s2">of us know but how did this how did this</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.840" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">really happen so I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.159" end="00:24:51.330" style="s2">combination of two big sort of one big</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:54.029" style="s2">historical event and then one big</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.330" end="00:24:55.860" style="s2">academic intellectual trend right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.029" end="00:24:59.580" style="s2">first the historical event is world war</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.860" end="00:25:01.260" style="s2">ii which while people like you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.580" end="00:25:03.230" style="s2">Mazzoni who&#39;s a really really good</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.260" end="00:25:06.299" style="s2">thinker on nationalism he he he views</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.230" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">germans ideology as imperialistic right</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.299" end="00:25:09.179" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t nationalists in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:10.409" style="s2">respecting individual nation states it</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.179" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">was imperialistic it was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.409" end="00:25:15.389" style="s2">impose a german empire german dominion</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:17.549" style="s2">over other states which is and he draws</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.389" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">that distinction i do too</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.549" end="00:25:22.519" style="s2">but the way that the general world</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:25.470" style="s2">treated world war ii is an outbreak of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.519" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">is an outbreak of nationalism it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">too much and that we need to shut it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:33.510" style="s2">down oddly enough replacing it with like</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">this european union which is yet another</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.510" end="00:25:37.539" style="s2">sort of distinct but in another</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:39.820" style="s2">imperialist idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.539" end="00:25:41.590" style="s2">a liberal imperialist idea instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.820" end="00:25:44.229" style="s2">racist imperialism yeah but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.590" end="00:25:47.139" style="s2">still imperialist mm-hmm so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.229" end="00:25:48.580" style="s2">trend the sort of World War two making</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.139" end="00:25:51.070" style="s2">national is on a dirty word because</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.580" end="00:25:52.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what the intellectuals associated</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.070" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">with Hitler was strong with others and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.600" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">then the second is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:02.759" style="s2">resurgence of I think Marxism on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:05.979" style="s2">left in academia because underlying</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.759" end="00:26:08.889" style="s2">Marxism especially classical Marxism is</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.979" end="00:26:10.869" style="s2">the idea that classes cross national you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.889" end="00:26:13.599" style="s2">know internationally will unify to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.869" end="00:26:14.289" style="s2">revolt against higher classes workers of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.599" end="00:26:16.269" style="s2">the world unite</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.289" end="00:26:19.179" style="s2">right and so so there&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.269" end="00:26:23.429" style="s2">tendency to very find the nationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.179" end="00:26:27.970" style="s2">impulse somewhat reactionary somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.429" end="00:26:29.619" style="s2">like retrograde so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.970" end="00:26:31.239" style="s2">interesting to see some of the the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.619" end="00:26:32.619" style="s2">sophisticated Marxist thinkers a guy</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.239" end="00:26:33.879" style="s2">like Benedict Anderson who wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.619" end="00:26:34.929" style="s2">called imagined communities when they</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.879" end="00:26:37.239" style="s2">come to actually grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.929" end="00:26:38.950" style="s2">nationalism because they&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.239" end="00:26:40.359" style="s2">situations where two Marxist countries</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.950" end="00:26:41.799" style="s2">invaded one another right go into</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.359" end="00:26:43.869" style="s2">Southeast Asia in the 70s and 80s you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.799" end="00:26:45.460" style="s2">had like Vietnam and Cambodia attacking</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.869" end="00:26:46.869" style="s2">each other in wars they&#39;re both these</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.460" end="00:26:48.789" style="s2">are both Marxist nations and good</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.869" end="00:26:51.009" style="s2">standing among the International</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.789" end="00:26:52.809" style="s2">communist movement but they&#39;re attacking</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.009" end="00:26:54.429" style="s2">each other due to these strong</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.809" end="00:26:55.629" style="s2">nationalistic impulses so they&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.429" end="00:26:57.639" style="s2">grapple with it in their own way but</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.629" end="00:27:01.239" style="s2">overall I think the fact that academia</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.639" end="00:27:03.519" style="s2">leads so leftwards is this really force</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.239" end="00:27:06.129" style="s2">against nationalism because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.519" end="00:27:08.470" style="s2">Pro this kind of you know one world</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.129" end="00:27:10.210" style="s2">humanity Pro Cholet area and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.470" end="00:27:12.190" style="s2">classical sense or just Pro the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.210" end="00:27:15.369" style="s2">unification of marginalized oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.190" end="00:27:18.249" style="s2">peoples nationalism doesn&#39;t really fit</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.369" end="00:27:20.470" style="s2">into that matrix at all right and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.249" end="00:27:23.799" style="s2">people that were in charge of and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.470" end="00:27:26.259" style="s2">running nationalistic countries also</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.799" end="00:27:27.970" style="s2">tended to be the property owners and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.259" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">entrepreneurs and the people of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.970" end="00:27:33.429" style="s2">and the landed people and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:35.259" style="s2">that is the natural enemy to Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.429" end="00:27:36.850" style="s2">obviously you know it all starts with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.259" end="00:27:38.770" style="s2">property rights and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.850" end="00:27:40.270" style="s2">that&#39;s a interestingly enough if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.770" end="00:27:42.010" style="s2">take a very specific approach to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.270" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">nationalism it&#39;s really about defending</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.010" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">defending personal property rights kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:48.310" style="s2">of I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s something more than</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:50.620" style="s2">that right like what is so this helps to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.310" end="00:27:55.300" style="s2">understand like what is a nation right</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.620" end="00:27:57.220" style="s2">like what is so a nation is an imagined</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.300" end="00:27:58.780" style="s2">community right that&#39;s the key line out</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.220" end="00:28:00.250" style="s2">of Benedict Anderson the idea is that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.780" end="00:28:06.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know all 300 million people in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.250" end="00:28:08.380" style="s2">United States but we like collectively</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.420" end="00:28:10.870" style="s2">conceptualize ourselves as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.380" end="00:28:13.420" style="s2">nation with them it&#39;s in a mat it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.870" end="00:28:16.060" style="s2">we all jointly have this imagination</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.420" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">together again by saying it&#39;s imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.060" end="00:28:19.810" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.340" end="00:28:22.210" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s just not tangible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.810" end="00:28:23.860" style="s2">just not tangible exactly yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.210" end="00:28:25.540" style="s2">key point that was made in the sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.860" end="00:28:27.010" style="s2">book as well yeah right yeah I remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.540" end="00:28:28.420" style="s2">reading sapiens and he made the exact</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.010" end="00:28:30.010" style="s2">same argument I&#39;m pretty sure he also</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.420" end="00:28:32.290" style="s2">ready anderson himself right being able</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.010" end="00:28:35.650" style="s2">to organize around an imaginary concept</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.290" end="00:28:37.630" style="s2">right but what what roots that imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.650" end="00:28:39.190" style="s2">can&#39;t do you know concept and makes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.630" end="00:28:42.040" style="s2">things that people go out and fight and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.190" end="00:28:44.920" style="s2">die for you know culture language</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.040" end="00:28:46.870" style="s2">history shared myths shared values all</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.920" end="00:28:48.580" style="s2">those things are really tangible to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.870" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">people it&#39;s you know we we joke about</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.580" end="00:28:51.610" style="s2">you know we for one thing that we do on</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:54.010" style="s2">Twitter we fly the flag right I have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.610" end="00:28:55.780" style="s2">flag and my name is bio we put flags</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.010" end="00:28:57.820" style="s2">when it&#39;s close to election time the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.780" end="00:28:59.260" style="s2">reason we do that is because the flag is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.820" end="00:29:00.550" style="s2">arson this incredibly powerful symbol</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.260" end="00:29:03.730" style="s2">that makes people more think more about</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.550" end="00:29:06.190" style="s2">their nation and more conservative so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.730" end="00:29:07.750" style="s2">we want people in the up run up to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.190" end="00:29:11.290" style="s2">election to see flags lots of them lots</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.750" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">of American flags it has it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.290" end="00:29:14.680" style="s2">incredibly powerful motivating force for</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:15.940" style="s2">people you know motivates people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.680" end="00:29:17.620" style="s2">fight and die it&#39;s motivated them to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.940" end="00:29:20.470" style="s2">fight and die for hundreds of years this</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.620" end="00:29:22.920" style="s2">national identity protection of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.470" end="00:29:26.050" style="s2">nation as opposed to merely their tribe</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.920" end="00:29:29.530" style="s2">and so that isn&#39;t that isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.050" end="00:29:33.220" style="s2">going anywhere the question is do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.530" end="00:29:35.740" style="s2">harness that and do you use you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.220" end="00:29:37.480" style="s2">ramp up the positive benefits of it or</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.740" end="00:29:40.330" style="s2">do you try and squelch it and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.480" end="00:29:42.040" style="s2">like the left and micron and all these</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.330" end="00:29:43.270" style="s2">people are like nationalism is this evil</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.040" end="00:29:45.190" style="s2">dirty thing we need to try and squelch</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:48.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like well one it&#39;s not and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.190" end="00:29:50.169" style="s2">slandering your own countrymen and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.220" end="00:29:52.989" style="s2">countrywomen by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.169" end="00:29:54.279" style="s2">but to you can&#39;t you can&#39;t squelch it if</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.989" end="00:29:55.720" style="s2">you try and squelch it you&#39;ll lose</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.279" end="00:29:57.399" style="s2">because you don&#39;t prioritize the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.720" end="00:29:59.109" style="s2">interests of the people that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.399" end="00:30:02.529" style="s2">else thinks he probably should be</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.109" end="00:30:05.499" style="s2">prioritizing I think what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.529" end="00:30:07.659" style="s2">is that if you put it in a historical</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.499" end="00:30:10.509" style="s2">perspective nationalism is a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.659" end="00:30:12.970" style="s2">recent concept right I mean even the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.509" end="00:30:14.619" style="s2">nation-state itself well exactly and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.970" end="00:30:17.259" style="s2">know the American Revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.619" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">French Revolution 18th century is really</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.259" end="00:30:21.999" style="s2">the first manifestation of any type of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:24.249" style="s2">nationalism and I think many people</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.999" end="00:30:27.249" style="s2">would see that as a positive right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.249" end="00:30:29.109" style="s2">then it grew it grew and like in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.249" end="00:30:31.029" style="s2">the 19th century is considered to be the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.109" end="00:30:33.519" style="s2">Europe the peak of European nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.029" end="00:30:36.309" style="s2">that is something that defines the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.519" end="00:30:37.869" style="s2">century in Europe and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.309" end="00:30:40.749" style="s2">beginning of the 20th century the United</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.869" end="00:30:43.419" style="s2">States super nationalism were closed off</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.749" end="00:30:45.669" style="s2">we&#39;re not participating we&#39;re caring</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.419" end="00:30:47.529" style="s2">about America and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.669" end="00:30:49.929" style="s2">transitioning all the way to the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.529" end="00:30:52.149" style="s2">side we&#39;re now nationalism is in its</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.929" end="00:30:54.850" style="s2">other extreme right so now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.149" end="00:30:56.470" style="s2">globalism it&#39;s not nationalism and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.850" end="00:30:59.830" style="s2">having these conversations about what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.470" end="00:31:02.249" style="s2">it you know because it&#39;s such a recent</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.830" end="00:31:04.659" style="s2">concept essentially if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.249" end="00:31:06.549" style="s2">human history right of human history I</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.659" end="00:31:08.379" style="s2">mean think about how long people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.549" end="00:31:10.059" style="s2">discussed you know what is democracy now</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.379" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about what is nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.059" end="00:31:14.109" style="s2">and if you could do away with</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:16.779" style="s2">nationalism what is left because before</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.109" end="00:31:18.220" style="s2">nationalism it was divided into like all</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.779" end="00:31:20.169" style="s2">the Christians were together and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.220" end="00:31:21.909" style="s2">there&#39;s this Muslim world and then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.169" end="00:31:25.119" style="s2">know we&#39;ve divided ourselves into tribes</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.909" end="00:31:28.570" style="s2">always and so the way we&#39;ve organized</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.119" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">the world now is based on nations and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.570" end="00:31:32.769" style="s2">if we get rid of that concept what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:35.499" style="s2">the world I mean the one extreme would</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.769" end="00:31:37.389" style="s2">be like it&#39;s going to dissolve something</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.499" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">else has to bind assault I still can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.389" end="00:31:40.749" style="s2">still can&#39;t get past this question of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:42.249" style="s2">you know if Donald Trump hadn&#39;t said</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.749" end="00:31:44.950" style="s2">that he was a nationalist what Marcone</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.249" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">be saying nationalism is bad no no</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.950" end="00:31:49.869" style="s2">probably not no right and so how much of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:51.429" style="s2">this sort of anti nationalistic I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.869" end="00:31:53.529" style="s2">making air quotes that you guys can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.429" end="00:31:56.950" style="s2">see how much of this anti nationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.529" end="00:31:59.529" style="s2">rhetoric is just politically motivated</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.950" end="00:32:03.130" style="s2">out of spite and anger and fear and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.529" end="00:32:05.140" style="s2">hatred of Donald Trump and legitimately</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.130" end="00:32:08.110" style="s2">you know a legitimate critique of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.140" end="00:32:10.600" style="s2">of nationalism I mean what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.110" end="00:32:12.910" style="s2">there I think it&#39;s like 90% you know tea</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.600" end="00:32:15.640" style="s2">Trump animus oh yeah actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.910" end="00:32:17.410" style="s2">assign the Trump just makes people angry</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.640" end="00:32:19.060" style="s2">so when Trump&#39;s associates himself with</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.410" end="00:32:21.430" style="s2">an idea you can be uncharitable to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.060" end="00:32:23.290" style="s2">idea people do it absolutely so I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.430" end="00:32:25.030" style="s2">it has to be I mean maybe there&#39;s 10% a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.290" end="00:32:26.920" style="s2">legitimate critique of nationalism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.030" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure people like Bill Kristol on</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.920" end="00:32:30.190" style="s2">the weekly stay but what does what those</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:31.390" style="s2">critiques be like talking talk that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.190" end="00:32:33.160" style="s2">through because you know on this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.390" end="00:32:35.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t want anybody to ever accuse us</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.160" end="00:32:37.090" style="s2">of just being you know one-sided and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.620" end="00:32:38.380" style="s2">just hammering things homeless we want</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.090" end="00:32:40.810" style="s2">to talk about it from both sides I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.380" end="00:32:43.180" style="s2">are there legitimate critiques of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.810" end="00:32:44.890" style="s2">nationalistic perspective well when the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.180" end="00:32:47.350" style="s2">nation takes priority over the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.890" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">individual to an extreme right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.350" end="00:32:50.650" style="s2">anything in extreme</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:53.230" style="s2">so--that&#39;s but that sounds like fascism</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.650" end="00:32:55.240" style="s2">exactly right so that&#39;s like it morphs</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.230" end="00:32:58.510" style="s2">right when you go into the extreme if</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.240" end="00:33:01.240" style="s2">you prioritize the nation and the air</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.510" end="00:33:02.500" style="s2">quotes the good of the nation right over</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.240" end="00:33:04.390" style="s2">the individual and they end up</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.500" end="00:33:06.790" style="s2">sacrificing the individual rather than</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.390" end="00:33:09.310" style="s2">lifting up all individuals right it can</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.790" end="00:33:11.530" style="s2">also be too much prioritization of of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.310" end="00:33:14.380" style="s2">national interest and in disregard of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.530" end="00:33:18.130" style="s2">the rights and in terms of City you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.380" end="00:33:19.480" style="s2">foreign people right non-citizens so if</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.130" end="00:33:20.980" style="s2">you know you get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.480" end="00:33:21.910" style="s2">you&#39;re purely national interest focused</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.980" end="00:33:23.500" style="s2">then maybe you think it&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.910" end="00:33:25.690" style="s2">national interest to conquer a country</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.500" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">and subject subjugate them right right</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.690" end="00:33:29.170" style="s2">now you can again hezonia would make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:32.230" style="s2">argument that once you start doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.170" end="00:33:33.580" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re outside of nationalism as</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.230" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">a foreign policy question because</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.580" end="00:33:37.420" style="s2">nationalism is a foreign policy theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:39.880" style="s2">is one that respects individual nation</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.420" end="00:33:41.350" style="s2">state sovereignty and one thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.880" end="00:33:43.590" style="s2">the ideal world is one where you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.350" end="00:33:47.320" style="s2">plenty of individual nation states</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.590" end="00:33:50.050" style="s2">pursuing their own objectives but is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.320" end="00:33:51.820" style="s2">idea sort of that in the same way that a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.050" end="00:33:54.750" style="s2">libertarian would expect that two</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.820" end="00:33:57.580" style="s2">individuals would make unique decisions</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.750" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">with themselves as the priority and then</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.490" end="00:34:07.660" style="s2">large is that sort of the same thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.410" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">when it comes to nation states being</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.030" end="00:34:18.169" style="s2">way to work sort of together</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.169" end="00:34:21.260" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a little I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:22.760" style="s2">little bit of that in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.260" end="00:34:24.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of idealized</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.760" end="00:34:27.350" style="s2">thinking about what happens when nations</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.919" end="00:34:29.150" style="s2">are individually pursuing their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.350" end="00:34:31.400" style="s2">interests does that necessarily lead to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.150" end="00:34:33.020" style="s2">good things right like that&#39;s the sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.400" end="00:34:35.179" style="s2">of no actually the you know the world is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.020" end="00:34:36.830" style="s2">a state of anarchy and if you have all</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.179" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">these individual nation states better</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:40.850" style="s2">actually competing for power then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:44.390" style="s2">get you know world wars you get right</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.850" end="00:34:46.550" style="s2">because on an individual level with</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.390" end="00:34:47.750" style="s2">humans and inside your markets and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.550" end="00:34:49.370" style="s2">you&#39;re in your country you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.750" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">constrained by you can straight by the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.370" end="00:34:52.310" style="s2">law right</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:53.570" style="s2">you know nation states aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.310" end="00:34:55.429" style="s2">necessarily I mean sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.570" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">international orders and international</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.429" end="00:34:59.270" style="s2">trade agreements and you know the UN and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:00.860" style="s2">whatever but really at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.270" end="00:35:02.990" style="s2">day like there&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.860" end="00:35:04.190" style="s2">international law constraining people</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.990" end="00:35:05.690" style="s2">from doing things if they wanted to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.190" end="00:35:06.830" style="s2">out there and invade the country next</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.690" end="00:35:08.330" style="s2">door to them they&#39;re just gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.830" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">when is that ever been sanctioned I</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.330" end="00:35:12.140" style="s2">guess the UN does a little bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">but really you know the UN&#39;s acting</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.140" end="00:35:16.820" style="s2">basically like as the u.s. is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:18.350" style="s2">surrogate in that regard when it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.820" end="00:35:21.470" style="s2">mean the u.s. is maintaining the global</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.350" end="00:35:23.750" style="s2">World Order and in many ways we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.470" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">actually a functional Empire even though</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.750" end="00:35:28.370" style="s2">I&#39;m anti imperialist in that sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:30.020" style="s2">a functional environ T the safety of the</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:38.390" style="s2">operate kind of as a world&#39;s policeman</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.440" end="00:35:40.370" style="s2">telling people like don&#39;t invade right</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.390" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">like we are the big either you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.370" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2">gonna mess with us and we that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:45.650" style="s2">against our interests so don&#39;t do it are</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:47.570" style="s2">you familiar with this independent</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.650" end="00:35:49.850" style="s2">journalist as a Caitlyn Johnstone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.570" end="00:35:51.710" style="s2">yeah she&#39;s been writing a lot lately</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.850" end="00:35:53.030" style="s2">about how the US military is like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.710" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">worst thing that ever happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.030" end="00:35:58.130" style="s2">planet Earth and that we need to pull</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:00.620" style="s2">back immediately exclusively with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.130" end="00:36:02.600" style="s2">exclusive goal of just defending our</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.620" end="00:36:04.520" style="s2">borders and that&#39;s the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.600" end="00:36:06.770" style="s2">the US military should be used for and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.520" end="00:36:10.010" style="s2">tried to try to talk to her she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.770" end="00:36:11.690" style="s2">well no one has been trying to invade</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.010" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">the United States forever why do we need</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.690" end="00:36:14.630" style="s2">to be force projecting all over the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.130" style="s2">country and no this is like a woman that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.630" end="00:36:17.780" style="s2">gets pretty good traction right she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.130" end="00:36:19.470" style="s2">got now since Allen&#39;s readers and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.780" end="00:36:21.900" style="s2">pretty well regarded</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.470" end="00:36:23.400" style="s2">I tried to remind her a one by force</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.900" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">projection other people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.400" end="00:36:27.690" style="s2">projecting their force right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.790" style="s2">the absence of an invading army is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.690" end="00:36:31.740" style="s2">going it&#39;s not a guarantee that there</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.790" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">won&#39;t be invading armies it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.740" end="00:36:35.130" style="s2">testament to the strength of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:36.660" style="s2">military but be I brought up this very</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.130" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">same question about the shipping lanes</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.660" end="00:36:41.160" style="s2">like we have other interests like</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:43.290" style="s2">nations and this is a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.160" end="00:36:47.190" style="s2">question between nationalism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.290" end="00:36:50.250" style="s2">globalism nation-states defend their</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.190" end="00:36:53.160" style="s2">interests right not just necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.250" end="00:36:54.900" style="s2">their borders right right and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.160" end="00:36:56.520" style="s2">our interest to have the shipping lanes</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.900" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">open all around the world and it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.520" end="00:37:00.330" style="s2">interest to have certain things be</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:03.150" style="s2">stable and under our Dominion and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.330" end="00:37:05.000" style="s2">whatnot that&#39;s not necessarily about</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:07.349" style="s2">Empire and it&#39;s not necessarily about</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.000" end="00:37:09.810" style="s2">globalism but specifically about our</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.349" end="00:37:11.880" style="s2">national interests and to what extent is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.810" end="00:37:14.280" style="s2">that conversation being had in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.880" end="00:37:16.260" style="s2">globalists versus nationalist debate</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.280" end="00:37:19.050" style="s2">well I think you know that almost isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.260" end="00:37:20.940" style="s2">really I wouldn&#39;t say necessarily fits</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.050" end="00:37:22.320" style="s2">on the either side of it it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.940" end="00:37:24.510" style="s2">more Liberty it&#39;s kind of both</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:27.140" style="s2">libertarianism and left libertarianism</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.510" end="00:37:29.220" style="s2">which devolves to this like pacifism</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.140" end="00:37:31.619" style="s2">almost isolationism I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.220" end="00:37:33.630" style="s2">too unfair to you know the Rand Paul</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.619" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">types but like there&#39;s that little</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.630" end="00:37:36.510" style="s2">strain of that that&#39;s just like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:38.940" style="s2">should just not do any of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.510" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">period right it&#39;s wrong we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.940" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">in any wars period we shouldn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:45.930" style="s2">military overseas period they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:47.310" style="s2">be stationed in South Korea say right</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.930" end="00:37:49.320" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s like South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.310" end="00:37:50.970" style="s2">just as a quick side notice is one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.320" end="00:37:52.890" style="s2">those things that I really flipped my</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.970" end="00:37:54.150" style="s2">mind on you know I would think when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.890" end="00:37:55.710" style="s2">was a libertarian I was like why are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.150" end="00:37:57.780" style="s2">why do we have 50,000 troops in South</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.710" end="00:37:59.339" style="s2">Korea and then once I became a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.780" end="00:38:01.050" style="s2">conservator I was like because that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.339" end="00:38:03.390" style="s2">it&#39;s North Korea knows that if they drop</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.050" end="00:38:05.310" style="s2">a bomb unsold that the United States has</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.390" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">populated that we are not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.310" end="00:38:10.140" style="s2">that we will have lost a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.670" style="s2">men and that we will you know we will</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.140" end="00:38:13.740" style="s2">retaliate with overwhelming force rape</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.670" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">are committed is a as a term borrowed</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.740" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">from poker which means that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:19.619" style="s2">enough money in the pot relative to in</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.619" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">in the hand you have no choice no no</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.150" end="00:38:26.820" style="s2">rational choice but to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">right so that&#39;s what so that serves to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.820" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">deter North Korea from doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">silly and that&#39;s that is one of our</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:36.820" style="s2">trysts right it&#39;s not in our it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.290" end="00:38:37.990" style="s2">the United States national interests to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.820" end="00:38:40.570" style="s2">have a war between North and South Korea</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.570" end="00:38:44.530" style="s2">like South Korea they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.610" end="00:38:46.750" style="s2">they&#39;re a bulwark against potential</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.820" end="00:38:56.200" style="s2">so if you are a Caitlyn Johnstone type</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">you might say well that&#39;s too bad like</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.200" end="00:39:00.220" style="s2">so what if North Korea and South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:02.590" style="s2">good war and to me that&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.220" end="00:39:03.700" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s just one it&#39;s clearly not in</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.700" end="00:39:06.910" style="s2">happen but to it&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.410" end="00:39:08.830" style="s2">appalling to just be indifferent to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.910" end="00:39:10.630" style="s2">outcome from a from a human perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.830" end="00:39:12.430" style="s2">right like and that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.630" end="00:39:14.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the potential for nationalism to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.430" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">go too far where you say I simply do not</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.320" end="00:39:17.590" style="s2">care about what happens to people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.390" style="s2">other countries right and that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.590" end="00:39:20.830" style="s2">right because like again if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.390" end="00:39:22.540" style="s2">talking about concentric circles of care</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.830" end="00:39:24.820" style="s2">there still is some amount of care that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.540" end="00:39:26.290" style="s2">you some duty of some ethical amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.820" end="00:39:27.550" style="s2">duty that you owe to people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.290" end="00:39:29.620" style="s2">citizens of your country and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.550" end="00:39:31.210" style="s2">has probably not be utterly indifferent</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.620" end="00:39:33.190" style="s2">to whether or not they go to war and die</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.210" end="00:39:34.450" style="s2">yeah but there is it there is a line</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.190" end="00:39:35.980" style="s2">that we have to draw because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.450" end="00:39:38.350" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to get involved in</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.980" end="00:39:40.570" style="s2">every manatorian issue around the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.350" end="00:39:43.360" style="s2">so it is it&#39;s not really that code of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.570" end="00:39:45.790" style="s2">ethics that&#39;s our duty that&#39;s motivating</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.360" end="00:39:47.320" style="s2">us it&#39;s it&#39;s money right sure I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.790" end="00:39:50.860" style="s2">they&#39;re you know much of that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.320" end="00:39:51.970" style="s2">certainly national interest but again</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.860" end="00:39:53.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just a question of part I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.970" end="00:39:56.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of prioritization like</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.860" end="00:39:57.820" style="s2">the globalists would say that this kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.650" end="00:39:59.260" style="s2">of prioritization is immoral like</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.820" end="00:40:01.090" style="s2">Emmanuel macron just said that he just</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.260" end="00:40:02.380" style="s2">said it&#39;s immoral to prioritize the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.090" end="00:40:04.510" style="s2">interests of your own citizens over the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.380" end="00:40:06.700" style="s2">citizens of other countries so what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.510" end="00:40:07.900" style="s2">his prioritization system then it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.700" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">one at least having a 20 percent</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.900" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">approval that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.700" end="00:40:16.320" style="s2">question for me it&#39;s like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">gonna replace this system of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.320" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">prioritizing yourself in your community</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:25.360" style="s2">than your nation first with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:27.180" style="s2">interests of people globally well now</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.360" end="00:40:29.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve got an even bigger pool of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.180" end="00:40:31.330" style="s2">competing priorities that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.290" end="00:40:33.630" style="s2">need to start to prioritize and how the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.330" end="00:40:37.480" style="s2">hell what what is the system for</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.630" end="00:40:40.420" style="s2">prioritizing the demands needs crisis</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.480" end="00:40:41.410" style="s2">ease whatever of seven are we up to 7</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.420" end="00:40:42.970" style="s2">billion I feel like we all just</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.410" end="00:40:44.950" style="s2">exaggerated the number it was like 5</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.970" end="00:40:48.339" style="s2">billion yesterday 6 billion today 7 bill</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.950" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">today whatever but all those good I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.339" end="00:40:51.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not growing that fast is it but</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:53.369" style="s2">like seven billion seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.400" end="00:40:55.180" style="s2">accepted number these days doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.369" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">but you know how do you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.180" end="00:40:59.380" style="s2">prioritize that kind of stuff and by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:01.990" style="s2">way like whose money are you gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.380" end="00:41:04.270" style="s2">using to do all that with oh you can use</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.990" end="00:41:05.800" style="s2">my money right you use my money in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.270" end="00:41:07.630" style="s2">nation in this nation-state through our</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.800" end="00:41:10.119" style="s2">taxes and such - what dude the all</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.630" end="00:41:12.540" style="s2">sudden prioritize other people around</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.119" end="00:41:15.250" style="s2">the world now how much of this is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.540" end="00:41:18.250" style="s2">rhetoric and how much of it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.250" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">real like on the ground terms of policy</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.250" end="00:41:24.490" style="s2">you know I think we&#39;ve made an argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:26.859" style="s2">here that things that look globalist or</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.490" end="00:41:28.869" style="s2">I could actually be nationalist in terms</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.859" end="00:41:31.210" style="s2">of really just defending our national</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.869" end="00:41:34.270" style="s2">interests it just happens to be that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.210" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">includes building a global structure to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.270" end="00:41:39.310" style="s2">you know monitor and control trade or</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:40.750" style="s2">you know building a system of laws and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.310" end="00:41:42.609" style="s2">treaties that are going to enable</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.750" end="00:41:45.010" style="s2">functioning shipping lanes and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.609" end="00:41:47.050" style="s2">whatnot these these are these are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.010" end="00:41:48.579" style="s2">items that people include in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.050" end="00:41:51.099" style="s2">globalist agenda right these</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.579" end="00:41:54.310" style="s2">transnational organizations and-and-and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.099" end="00:41:56.200" style="s2">multi multi-party agreements and force</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.310" end="00:42:01.240" style="s2">projection and militarily and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.200" end="00:42:04.030" style="s2">but how much of it is really serving a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.240" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">globalist goal versus serving a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.030" end="00:42:10.510" style="s2">nationalistic goal and I wonder like</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">what policy Marcone would implement that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.510" end="00:42:15.400" style="s2">would be different you know if he if he</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">had versus Trump let&#39;s say or just</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.400" end="00:42:19.510" style="s2">versus the Nationalists let&#39;s say like</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">how much of this is just dick</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.510" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">waving and saber rattling and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:27.069" style="s2">then an actual real-life difference on</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">the ground in terms of policy I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.069" end="00:42:31.750" style="s2">example is I think Obama though you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:34.630" style="s2">the web registry institution like we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.750" end="00:42:36.339" style="s2">controlled I don&#39;t know oh yeah I can I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:38.500" style="s2">can&#39;t right we controlled that right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.339" end="00:42:40.690" style="s2">then we gave it to the UN why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.500" end="00:42:41.740" style="s2">know right right for from a nationalist</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.690" end="00:42:43.390" style="s2">perspective that doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.740" end="00:42:44.619" style="s2">right our national interest is best</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.390" end="00:42:45.970" style="s2">served by controlling this thing all</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.619" end="00:42:47.710" style="s2">right why would we not want to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.970" end="00:42:50.230" style="s2">globalist recession would say well we</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.710" end="00:42:51.430" style="s2">don&#39;t have a moral right to own it like</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.230" end="00:42:54.460" style="s2">it belongs to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.430" end="00:42:55.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like but no actually we we do own</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.460" end="00:42:57.550" style="s2">it though and we don&#39;t have to give it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.660" end="00:42:58.730" style="s2">up and our national interest is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.550" end="00:43:01.010" style="s2">served by giving up right</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.730" end="00:43:02.270" style="s2">the the globalists logic is the only one</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.010" end="00:43:03.980" style="s2">that could say we have an ethical duty</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.270" end="00:43:06.380" style="s2">to humanity to give up things to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.980" end="00:43:08.770" style="s2">humanity it&#39;s like no our interest come</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.380" end="00:43:11.950" style="s2">first were nationalists mm-hmm you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.770" end="00:43:14.810" style="s2">like we have an ethical duty to consider</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.950" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">people in other countries and we too to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.810" end="00:43:18.829" style="s2">not rent they&#39;re not an ethical zero but</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:20.920" style="s2">their interests do not come before ours</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.829" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">choose the option that has the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.920" end="00:43:26.869" style="s2">fewest least consequences right on like</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:29.030" style="s2">do what reminds me Jack of what you used</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.869" end="00:43:31.730" style="s2">to say doing what I want while doing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.030" end="00:43:33.619" style="s2">most good right yeah make us most make</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.730" end="00:43:34.910" style="s2">as much money as I can walk while doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.619" end="00:43:37.790" style="s2">as much good as I can the same time</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.910" end="00:43:40.099" style="s2">right yeah well this brings up another</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.790" end="00:43:42.050" style="s2">conversation that I had again the guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.099" end="00:43:44.750" style="s2">name is escaping me but his name&#39;s Alex</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.050" end="00:43:47.990" style="s2">and he is the the head immigration guy</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.750" end="00:43:51.020" style="s2">Cato I think nono rasca a Rasta yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.990" end="00:43:53.240" style="s2">to his credit he&#39;s been really cool in</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.020" end="00:43:54.770" style="s2">terms of engagement on Twitter I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.240" end="00:43:56.380" style="s2">reached out to him a number of times to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.770" end="00:44:00.140" style="s2">have these conversations on immigration</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.380" end="00:44:03.380" style="s2">he is a completely wide open no fences</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.140" end="00:44:06.500" style="s2">like no no border no passport control</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:08.930" style="s2">like come one come on early immigration</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.500" end="00:44:11.000" style="s2">control is unconstitutional like I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.930" end="00:44:13.190" style="s2">and immoral yeah that&#39;s the argument</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.000" end="00:44:14.359" style="s2">that he would make I think right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.190" end="00:44:17.030" style="s2">he&#39;s been really cool in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.359" end="00:44:20.740" style="s2">engaging with me on that and I what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.030" end="00:44:23.270" style="s2">what I&#39;m struggling with is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.740" end="00:44:27.859" style="s2">create like a mental model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.270" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">that where your morality for like your</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.859" end="00:44:33.770" style="s2">fellow man like does it extend globally</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:36.380" style="s2">or does it like is there an actual end</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.770" end="00:44:37.730" style="s2">to it because sometimes sometimes your</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.380" end="00:44:38.810" style="s2">self interests you know are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.730" end="00:44:42.050" style="s2">compete with other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.810" end="00:44:46.210" style="s2">self-interest and you know how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.050" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">square like being good people and with</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.210" end="00:44:53.180" style="s2">you know your the border of your nation</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:55.310" style="s2">being the end of your morality is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.180" end="00:44:57.079" style="s2">if that makes I guess I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.310" end="00:44:59.089" style="s2">little trouble explaining this concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.079" end="00:45:00.980" style="s2">but you know if you believe that like</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.089" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">the United States is a great economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.980" end="00:45:04.069" style="s2">driver and a way to bring people out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:06.230" style="s2">poverty in a place for a great</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.069" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">opportunity then I think that there can</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.230" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">be a pretty solid argument made that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:10.760" style="s2">like hey you know if you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">your life better come to United States</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.760" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">cuz it will it will expand human</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:17.840" style="s2">happiness and and and reduce human</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:20.210" style="s2">suffering but at the same time you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.840" end="00:45:22.190" style="s2">we have to also focus on our own our own</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.210" end="00:45:24.050" style="s2">priorities here at home and to what</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.190" end="00:45:25.730" style="s2">extent that that&#39;s going to impact us so</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.050" end="00:45:27.950" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the trade-off I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.730" end="00:45:29.750" style="s2">thinking us like I can help these people</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.950" end="00:45:31.190" style="s2">in this other country by a giving the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.750" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2">money having them come to United States</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.190" end="00:45:35.570" style="s2">and work here whatnot but it all comes</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.530" end="00:45:38.360" style="s2">at a cost and I&#39;m trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.570" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">how to square those costs and in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.360" end="00:45:41.750" style="s2">same sort of moral framework that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:43.460" style="s2">apply to your neighbors and to your</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.750" end="00:45:45.800" style="s2">family and to people living in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.460" end="00:45:47.720" style="s2">community are we supposed to or expect</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.800" end="00:45:49.160" style="s2">it to apply that same moral framework to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.720" end="00:45:51.830" style="s2">people that live outside of our country</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.160" end="00:45:54.140" style="s2">and then how do we do that and if we do</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.830" end="00:45:56.660" style="s2">do that do we have do we even have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.140" end="00:46:00.110" style="s2">nation like what what is really dividing</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.660" end="00:46:02.090" style="s2">us as a nation state versus other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.110" end="00:46:03.470" style="s2">aside from obviously the Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.090" end="00:46:06.500" style="s2">and whatever living United States but</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.470" end="00:46:09.470" style="s2">but Wow like how does that impact our</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.500" end="00:46:10.820" style="s2">moral systems it&#39;s I think so what</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.470" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">divides us there&#39;s a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.820" end="00:46:15.980" style="s2">questions in that that come what divides</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">us to start there is you know language</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.980" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">culture you know common history common</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:23.750" style="s2">myths common understanding and common</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:27.710" style="s2">loyalty to whatever that you know all</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.750" end="00:46:29.090" style="s2">those things that we can rightly expect</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.710" end="00:46:30.950" style="s2">people within the country to be more</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.090" end="00:46:32.600" style="s2">likely to have and that&#39;s why you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.950" end="00:46:33.890" style="s2">when we go you know feel like you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.600" end="00:46:36.350" style="s2">that different country when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.890" end="00:46:38.210" style="s2">Albuquerque for Seattle I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.350" end="00:46:41.000" style="s2">different than DC but it&#39;s still America</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.210" end="00:46:43.580" style="s2">like you same restaurants same language</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.000" end="00:46:45.710" style="s2">same concerns we&#39;re all in the same news</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.580" end="00:46:47.000" style="s2">like well that&#39;s same news for all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.710" end="00:46:49.340" style="s2">same news like it&#39;s not that different</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.000" end="00:46:51.620" style="s2">so because we&#39;re all in that boat we</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.340" end="00:46:53.570" style="s2">have I think arch each other more you</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.620" end="00:46:55.550" style="s2">know more care and concern than we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.570" end="00:46:57.020" style="s2">people in other countries that we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.550" end="00:46:58.430" style="s2">potential immigrants but is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.020" end="00:47:00.170" style="s2">unique to the United States those</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.430" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">defining characteristics of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.170" end="00:47:05.180" style="s2">up your nation-state I think even that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:07.190" style="s2">perspective sure the American distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.180" end="00:47:10.010" style="s2">American sure I mean that perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.190" end="00:47:12.230" style="s2">distinctly American but in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.010" end="00:47:14.330" style="s2">perspective is also then part of what</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.230" end="00:47:16.370" style="s2">binds us right if you look up the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.330" end="00:47:18.440" style="s2">definition of nationalism one phrase</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.370" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">that comes up is the idea of a national</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.440" end="00:47:23.120" style="s2">consciousness so I think that idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">that you know you go to Alburquerque or</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.120" end="00:47:27.880" style="s2">Seattle and you know you&#39;re in America</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:31.340" style="s2">right because we all kind of share this</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.880" end="00:47:32.810" style="s2">unspoken unconscious feeling together</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.340" end="00:47:34.010" style="s2">and you can go to France you can go to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.810" end="00:47:37.070" style="s2">and you can go to any other country and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.010" end="00:47:38.570" style="s2">they there&#39;s a similar feeling right if</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.070" end="00:47:40.450" style="s2">you are an outsider because they all</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.570" end="00:47:42.590" style="s2">share this one kind of national</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.450" end="00:47:43.820" style="s2">consciousness yeah you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.590" end="00:47:45.860" style="s2">an expat you know when you&#39;re not an</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.820" end="00:47:47.600" style="s2">extra as an American like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.860" end="00:47:49.250" style="s2">really powerful difference yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.600" end="00:47:50.840" style="s2">you&#39;re in a foreign country like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.250" end="00:47:52.940" style="s2">just not you&#39;re you&#39;re not part of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.840" end="00:47:54.920" style="s2">right and that&#39;s and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.940" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">ethnically driven that oh no the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.920" end="00:47:59.090" style="s2">consciousness right you don&#39;t speak the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:01.760" style="s2">language you don&#39;t get whatever their</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.090" end="00:48:03.890" style="s2">concerns are you don&#39;t write because I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.760" end="00:48:05.720" style="s2">mean even go into like Anglo countries I</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.890" end="00:48:07.130" style="s2">guess as a white American go to niggle</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.720" end="00:48:09.560" style="s2">country and you&#39;re like oh yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.130" end="00:48:12.860" style="s2">this is I am not English I&#39;m not come</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.560" end="00:48:14.930" style="s2">here I am NOT you know I may have like</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.860" end="00:48:17.030" style="s2">you go to my ancestry of my DNA test and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.930" end="00:48:19.250" style="s2">you&#39;ll end up like yes I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.030" end="00:48:20.660" style="s2">English DNA but I am NOT English right</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.250" end="00:48:23.900" style="s2">right I&#39;m American</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.660" end="00:48:25.960" style="s2">so our nationalistic consciousness is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.900" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">made up of what shared experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.960" end="00:48:32.660" style="s2">culture values attitudes you know all</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:36.740" style="s2">the things I make money in Italy yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.660" end="00:48:38.810" style="s2">yeah and to what extent are those</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.740" end="00:48:41.230" style="s2">malleable and then if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.810" end="00:48:43.850" style="s2">that changing and then you know are like</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.230" end="00:48:46.100" style="s2">organizational documents are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.850" end="00:48:50.780" style="s2">fixed depending on your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.100" end="00:48:52.940" style="s2">right hey I wonder you know as as things</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.780" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">shift and change and you know I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.940" end="00:48:57.380" style="s2">trying to understand what people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:59.450" style="s2">perspective of nationalism is and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.380" end="00:49:00.830" style="s2">the negative critiques are here and this</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.450" end="00:49:05.960" style="s2">is sort of from one of those rounds I</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.830" end="00:49:08.690" style="s2">think is are the American binds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.960" end="00:49:10.940" style="s2">nationalism stronger or weaker than</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.690" end="00:49:12.980" style="s2">other cases globally that may have</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.940" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">different foundations for their their</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.980" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">binding landing nation so I think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:19.580" style="s2">I think we&#39;re weaker in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:20.750" style="s2">actual by things that bind 300 million</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.580" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">people together they&#39;re gonna be weaker</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.750" end="00:49:25.130" style="s2">than a place like Poland you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:29.030" style="s2">right right yeah which has a much more</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.130" end="00:49:30.200" style="s2">dramatic history it&#39;s like Poland</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.030" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">especially the Red Pony saw their</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.200" end="00:49:33.260" style="s2">Independence Day 200,000 people in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:34.220" style="s2">streets of Warsaw&#39;s is not a big country</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.260" end="00:49:35.900" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.220" end="00:49:38.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a very strong nationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.900" end="00:49:41.330" style="s2">feeling in Poland well they have they</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.750" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">have the extra binding component of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.330" end="00:49:46.820" style="s2">ethnic at the I command home at jetan</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:49.550" style="s2">homogeny thank you imagine aunty</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.820" end="00:49:52.670" style="s2">homogeneity three of us we finally I</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.550" end="00:49:54.530" style="s2">think the u.s. is stronger and weaker</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.670" end="00:49:56.869" style="s2">right one one thing that makes us unique</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.530" end="00:49:59.240" style="s2">is that we were kind of one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.869" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">countries to decide that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.240" end="00:50:03.260" style="s2">going to be bound by principles and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.840" style="s2">philosophy and a documents and things</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.260" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">like the Enlightenment ideals and not</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.840" end="00:50:10.760" style="s2">ethnic heritage right because you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:13.820" style="s2">say that the United States is a country</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.760" end="00:50:15.530" style="s2">of immigrants right I know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.820" end="00:50:17.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot in there there is a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.530" end="00:50:20.119" style="s2">there I know so in a way we were like we</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.750" end="00:50:22.250" style="s2">were the first we leave pioneers and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.119" end="00:50:23.810" style="s2">this these Enlightenment ideals and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.250" end="00:50:25.490" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what I was always told</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.810" end="00:50:27.020" style="s2">growing up right what does it mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.490" end="00:50:28.010" style="s2">American doesn&#39;t matter what color you</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.020" end="00:50:30.500" style="s2">are it matters that you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.010" end="00:50:32.990" style="s2">freedom and democracy and free speech</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.500" end="00:50:34.730" style="s2">and all these things I think that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.990" end="00:50:36.710" style="s2">the very defining characteristic like</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.730" end="00:50:38.570" style="s2">civic nationalism right right right but</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.710" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">at the same time you you go to Poland</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.570" end="00:50:42.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve been to Poland and I was in awe of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:45.980" style="s2">this feeling that they have of their</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.920" end="00:50:48.380" style="s2">nationalism and how they are so United</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.980" end="00:50:51.550" style="s2">and they&#39;re united very specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.380" end="00:50:54.020" style="s2">like deep cultural heritage history for</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.869" end="00:51:19.160" style="s2">shared you know that level of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.570" end="00:51:21.530" style="s2">especially something like shared</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.160" end="00:51:22.940" style="s2">ethnicity I mean impossible you know the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.530" end="00:51:25.070" style="s2">United States was multi-ethnic from</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.940" end="00:51:26.839" style="s2">founding and it&#39;s a core part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.070" end="00:51:28.369" style="s2">history that binds us together is things</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.839" end="00:51:31.190" style="s2">like the Civil War fought to liberate</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.369" end="00:51:32.300" style="s2">the slaves World War two the Civil</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.190" end="00:51:34.910" style="s2">Rights Act and the civil rights struggle</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.300" end="00:51:37.160" style="s2">right like these things are if history</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.910" end="00:51:40.520" style="s2">is what unites a people or a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.160" end="00:51:41.810" style="s2">it then you can&#39;t create an ethnos State</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.520" end="00:51:43.580" style="s2">in the United States that would be in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.810" end="00:51:45.230" style="s2">any sense American right that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.580" end="00:51:46.670" style="s2">connect to any of that type of American</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.230" end="00:51:47.180" style="s2">nationalism unless you skipped three</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.670" end="00:51:49.940" style="s2">hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.180" end="00:51:51.380" style="s2">of history I started like yesterday my</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.940" end="00:51:53.329" style="s2">back like pre founding that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.380" end="00:51:54.859" style="s2">right so this is dry this is getting me</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.329" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">to the point that I was trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.859" end="00:52:01.700" style="s2">know on on elitist to which is we lack</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:04.819" style="s2">the pleura ethnic racial you you not</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.700" end="00:52:07.220" style="s2">unification and the American</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.819" end="00:52:09.170" style="s2">consciousness and our founding documents</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.220" end="00:52:12.890" style="s2">but our this consciousness that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.170" end="00:52:16.220" style="s2">spoke of is what really defines what it</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.890" end="00:52:18.140" style="s2">means to be an American so to what</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.220" end="00:52:20.569" style="s2">extent does that consciousness require</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.140" end="00:52:23.270" style="s2">handling to what extent does that</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.569" end="00:52:27.550" style="s2">consciousness require some level of care</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.270" end="00:52:31.309" style="s2">and application and intentionality and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.550" end="00:52:34.190" style="s2">you know proactive engagement with it</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.309" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">how do we foster it can we can we guide</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.190" end="00:52:38.030" style="s2">at certain places is that it has that</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:40.339" style="s2">happened in history is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.030" end="00:52:43.819" style="s2">problematic is it something that we just</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.339" end="00:52:45.170" style="s2">leave to evolve on its own or is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.819" end="00:52:47.270" style="s2">something that we need to be cognizant</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.170" end="00:52:49.550" style="s2">of and conscious of and and something</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.270" end="00:52:53.420" style="s2">that we need to to really put our hands</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.550" end="00:52:56.900" style="s2">on to sort of control because it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.420" end="00:52:59.089" style="s2">ethereal mm-hmm and it could go away</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.900" end="00:53:00.829" style="s2">right yeah and you kind of feel it going</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.089" end="00:53:04.280" style="s2">away okay I think it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.829" end="00:53:06.230" style="s2">been fostered in the past I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.280" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">look at pictures and images and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.230" end="00:53:11.450" style="s2">traditions and you you missed school to</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.770" style="s2">go to parades right to celebrate your</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.450" end="00:53:14.359" style="s2">country you said the Pledge of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.770" end="00:53:16.250" style="s2">Allegiance every single day in school</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.359" end="00:53:18.109" style="s2">and remember that we were told that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.250" end="00:53:21.049" style="s2">America was the best country and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.109" end="00:53:23.990" style="s2">so lucky to be here and now if you were</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.049" end="00:53:25.970" style="s2">to tell your child that or a teacher in</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.990" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">a public school were to say that America</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.970" end="00:53:30.410" style="s2">is the best country and we should all be</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:32.450" style="s2">so grateful to be here I mean they would</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.410" end="00:53:34.819" style="s2">lose their job yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.450" end="00:53:36.109" style="s2">blasphemous you know what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.819" end="00:53:37.190" style="s2">handling do you have to put on something</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.109" end="00:53:39.980" style="s2">like this well I mean I think you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.190" end="00:53:42.260" style="s2">to do significant product effective</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.980" end="00:53:43.670" style="s2">propaganda work on behalf of like</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.260" end="00:53:46.069" style="s2">American nationalism because if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.670" end="00:53:48.230" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like an ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.069" end="00:53:51.260" style="s2">nationalism that just it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.230" end="00:53:53.260" style="s2">entrenched in the place right like if if</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.260" end="00:53:55.849" style="s2">you&#39;re in an ethnically homogenous place</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.260" end="00:53:57.740" style="s2">you know the extent to which you all</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.849" end="00:53:59.359" style="s2">feel bound or unified together is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.740" end="00:54:00.200" style="s2">probably a lot more robust than if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:02.060" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.200" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">you are members of different cultural</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.060" end="00:54:07.099" style="s2">tribes but unified by the civic</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">commitment so would you say that the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.099" end="00:54:11.060" style="s2">binds are weaker I&#39;d say that the binds</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:12.950" style="s2">are weaker binding Americans together</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.060" end="00:54:14.780" style="s2">than binding poles together for instance</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.950" end="00:54:16.010" style="s2">I think that&#39;s it&#39;s just hard not to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.780" end="00:54:17.450" style="s2">look at Poland oh yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.010" end="00:54:19.400" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.450" end="00:54:23.089" style="s2">that said Poland is at a disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.400" end="00:54:25.400" style="s2">because it can only be poles right like</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.089" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">they can&#39;t they can&#39;t just form a you</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.400" end="00:54:28.970" style="s2">know try to make a European super-state</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:30.349" style="s2">to compete a great power level with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.970" end="00:54:32.540" style="s2">United States and with China and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.349" end="00:54:34.010" style="s2">the Russia they can&#39;t doesn&#39;t work you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.540" end="00:54:35.780" style="s2">know like they&#39;re they&#39;re desperately</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.010" end="00:54:36.950" style="s2">trying and it doesn&#39;t work because they</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.780" end="00:54:38.210" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t have the same national</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.950" end="00:54:41.000" style="s2">history or national identity and as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.210" end="00:54:43.369" style="s2">result they are limited to having strong</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.000" end="00:54:45.290" style="s2">nationalisms within very small</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.369" end="00:54:47.150" style="s2">geographic places whereas because our</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.290" end="00:54:49.910" style="s2">nationalism is inherently more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.150" end="00:54:51.410" style="s2">it&#39;s inherently more tolerant we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.910" end="00:54:52.730" style="s2">integrate a lot more people easily and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.410" end="00:54:54.829" style="s2">it also means we have an advantage when</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.730" end="00:54:57.079" style="s2">it comes to integrating new talent right</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.829" end="00:54:59.480" style="s2">like say we want to we want access to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.079" end="00:55:02.200" style="s2">the best entrepreneurs in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.480" end="00:55:05.420" style="s2">best technologists in the world well</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.200" end="00:55:07.430" style="s2">English is the lingua franca America as</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.420" end="00:55:09.339" style="s2">a history of accepting immigrants and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.430" end="00:55:12.470" style="s2">making it easy for immigrants to become</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.339" end="00:55:15.380" style="s2">American when they get here so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.470" end="00:55:17.270" style="s2">real power and now there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.380" end="00:55:20.030" style="s2">national interest in making American</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.270" end="00:55:21.500" style="s2">nationalism accessible that said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.030" end="00:55:22.970" style="s2">not just you snap your fingers you</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.500" end="00:55:26.060" style="s2">become an American I mean if you if</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.970" end="00:55:28.069" style="s2">somebody comes here as Omaha be a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.060" end="00:55:30.230" style="s2">committed wahat believer in Wahhabi</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.069" end="00:55:32.060" style="s2">Islam in what sense are they</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.230" end="00:55:33.890" style="s2">meaningfully becoming American by moving</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.060" end="00:55:35.750" style="s2">here if they if their fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.890" end="00:55:37.310" style="s2">ideology conflicts with everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.750" end="00:55:42.740" style="s2">anything that would be a unifying</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.310" end="00:55:44.750" style="s2">American ideal yeah and is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.740" end="00:55:48.109" style="s2">not a fatal flaw of an open system they</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.750" end="00:55:51.230" style="s2">it can and will attract and permit those</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.109" end="00:55:53.839" style="s2">in its myths that are actively working</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.230" end="00:55:54.740" style="s2">against them or fatally oriented I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.839" end="00:55:57.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a flaw I just don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.740" end="00:55:59.390" style="s2">think it&#39;s fatal right it&#39;s the downside</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.140" end="00:56:02.450" style="s2">of being tolerant is that sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.390" end="00:56:04.700" style="s2">tolerate things you shouldn&#39;t and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.450" end="00:56:06.500" style="s2">on net we&#39;re better off in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.700" end="00:56:08.390" style="s2">we have a lot of tolerance and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.500" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">occasionally tolerate too much I think</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.330" end="00:56:59.120" style="s2">a straight-up fascist like saying I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.810" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">a fascist because I thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.120" end="00:57:06.280" style="s2">government should work to build an</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.280" end="00:57:12.290" style="s2">fascism now I can see if your goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.370" end="00:57:14.900" style="s2">build this American consciousness and to</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.290" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">you know one that supports the state at</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.900" end="00:57:18.620" style="s2">all costs and then you know it exports</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:21.410" style="s2">hate and violence and starts invading</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.620" end="00:57:24.680" style="s2">other countries and whatnot but to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.410" end="00:57:27.980" style="s2">that any effort towards building a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.680" end="00:57:30.380" style="s2">national identity is is a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.980" end="00:57:33.560" style="s2">tendency I think is really gonna limit</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.380" end="00:57:36.880" style="s2">us and it seems to me that one of our</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.560" end="00:57:40.070" style="s2">political parties today is anti-american</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.880" end="00:57:43.070" style="s2">consciousness and you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.070" end="00:57:44.930" style="s2">Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign in the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.070" end="00:57:46.250" style="s2">that she adopted and I&#39;m bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.930" end="00:57:47.540" style="s2">another subject real quick here but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.250" end="00:57:49.990" style="s2">way she adopted the language of</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.990" end="00:57:55.490" style="s2">and all these concepts that are an</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.670" end="00:57:58.550" style="s2">anthem to Western civilization and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.490" end="00:58:01.340" style="s2">primacy of the individual I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.550" end="00:58:02.690" style="s2">why she wanted to become president like</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.690" end="00:58:07.520" style="s2">of the United States the leader of</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.340" end="00:58:18.590" style="s2">anti America why I don&#39;t I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.090" end="00:58:20.150" style="s2">that do you understand that I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.590" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">Hillary Clinton it&#39;s just power right</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.150" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">like if you&#39;re trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.010" style="s2">Hillary Clinton&#39;s motivations right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:26.460" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty simple she wants power I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.010" end="00:58:29.820" style="s2">was giving her a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.460" end="00:58:31.650" style="s2">yes she deserved there that mean the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.820" end="00:58:34.320" style="s2">general problem of I think the left not</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.650" end="00:58:36.359" style="s2">having a unifying ideology for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.320" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">country I mean other than sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.359" end="00:58:40.680" style="s2">unifying against white people in my</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:44.790" style="s2">judgment like I don&#39;t yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.680" end="00:58:46.500" style="s2">white men white men right like I call</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.500" end="00:58:49.410" style="s2">bigoted now cuz I don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.849" end="00:58:50.520" style="s2">institutionally racist because the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.410" end="00:58:53.010" style="s2">debate about whether or not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.520" end="00:58:54.930" style="s2">racist I want to avoid it all right</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.010" end="00:58:56.430" style="s2">because they stole the word racism away</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.930" end="00:58:58.109" style="s2">from being actually prejudiced and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.430" end="00:58:59.730" style="s2">acting on those prejudices and now</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.109" end="00:59:01.770" style="s2">they&#39;ve incorporated you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.730" end="00:59:03.270" style="s2">this sense of power right exactly so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.770" end="00:59:04.680" style="s2">sidestepped at a that debate because</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.270" end="00:59:07.109" style="s2">they haven&#39;t redefined bigotry yet and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.680" end="00:59:09.510" style="s2">they certainly are bigoted certainly</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.109" end="00:59:11.460" style="s2">bigoted and not only not only the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.510" end="00:59:13.320" style="s2">Democratic Party but then the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.460" end="00:59:14.460" style="s2">institution&#39;s support the Democratic</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.990" end="01:00:39.990" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of like what</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.280" end="01:00:42.210" style="s2">the big ideological project for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.990" end="01:00:44.060" style="s2">right it&#39;s to defeat that right it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.210" end="01:00:46.260" style="s2">say that doesn&#39;t get to win we you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.060" end="01:00:48.150" style="s2">institutional bigotry against a portion</p>

<p begin="01:00:48.150" end="01:00:52.650" style="s2">okay right we don&#39;t think racism is okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:55.110" style="s2">well this isn&#39;t okay either right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.650" end="01:00:57.660" style="s2">yes racism was a more profound evil</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.110" end="01:00:59.790" style="s2">especially at the time it was right but</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.660" end="01:01:01.080" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you suddenly that open</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.790" end="01:01:03.870" style="s2">institutional bigotry against white</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.080" end="01:01:07.290" style="s2">people is okay it&#39;s not and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.870" end="01:01:09.710" style="s2">it&#39;s dis unifying one right it&#39;s pitting</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.290" end="01:01:12.990" style="s2">citizens against other citizens not okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.710" end="01:01:14.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s just something that just</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.990" end="01:01:18.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sit right with me personally</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.070" end="01:01:20.220" style="s2">right right like the you know the I ya</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.300" end="01:01:21.840" style="s2">know it&#39;s not just just not okay and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.220" end="01:01:24.270" style="s2">that&#39;s like the Enel you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.840" end="01:01:25.950" style="s2">ideological project of the right is what</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.270" end="01:01:28.140" style="s2">winning this cold civil war looks like</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.950" end="01:01:30.090" style="s2">is defeating the left electoral enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.140" end="01:01:31.740" style="s2">to the point that they&#39;re like hey you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.090" end="01:01:32.430" style="s2">know this intersectionality stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.740" end="01:01:34.260" style="s2">was dumb</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.430" end="01:01:36.780" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go back to Bill Clinton and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.260" end="01:01:38.730" style="s2">well yeah being a moderate eating almost</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.780" end="01:01:40.410" style="s2">an interpretive yeah right and then back</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.730" end="01:01:42.150" style="s2">to like hey maybe we should unify as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.410" end="01:01:43.650" style="s2">country together around American ideals</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.150" end="01:01:46.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like once you have that and like</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.650" end="01:01:47.730" style="s2">debates about health care or and all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.500" end="01:01:50.010" style="s2">other stuff that&#39;s all just technocracy</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.730" end="01:01:51.540" style="s2">that&#39;s fine you know however that comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.010" end="01:01:53.310" style="s2">down America is still gonna be America</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.540" end="01:01:55.290" style="s2">at the end of the day but if we lose the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.310" end="01:01:58.200" style="s2">debate about like this major cultural</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.290" end="01:02:01.020" style="s2">ideological issue you know big trouble</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.200" end="01:02:02.790" style="s2">well I think that the midterm results</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.020" end="01:02:05.670" style="s2">showed that that divide is becoming even</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.790" end="01:02:08.190" style="s2">more profound you know I think I saw the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.670" end="01:02:10.080" style="s2">voting voting breakdowns from some exit</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.190" end="01:02:13.410" style="s2">polls that showed you know something</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.080" end="01:02:16.350" style="s2">like 98 percent of black women voted</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.410" end="01:02:17.760" style="s2">Democrat and you know 70 some percent of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.350" end="01:02:19.980" style="s2">white women I may have these numbers</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.760" end="01:02:21.870" style="s2">wrong but it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty clear that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.980" end="01:02:25.950" style="s2">the way the the voting is breaking down</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.870" end="01:02:29.940" style="s2">across the racial and gender divides Wow</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.950" end="01:02:33.090" style="s2">how do how do we how do we stop that</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.940" end="01:02:35.220" style="s2">from happening or how do what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.090" end="01:02:39.050" style="s2">conversation do we have with people in</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.220" end="01:02:42.810" style="s2">order to you know look I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.050" end="01:02:45.930" style="s2">polarization inevitably is bad for bad</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.810" end="01:02:48.390" style="s2">for us right we don&#39;t we don&#39;t want one</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.930" end="01:02:49.230" style="s2">party to be the party of like minorities</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.390" end="01:02:51.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.230" end="01:02:52.590" style="s2">but do you say people color and one</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.240" end="01:02:54.780" style="s2">party to be the party of white people</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.590" end="01:02:56.460" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not good that&#39;s not good but</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.780" end="01:02:58.200" style="s2">that&#39;s in a way that mean I think the</p>

<p begin="01:02:58.200" end="01:03:03.150" style="s2">right right and I think part of it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.920" end="01:03:04.440" style="s2">you know the Republican Party doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:03:19.020" end="01:03:22.410" style="s2">Republicans are meaningfully committed</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.609" end="01:03:23.880" style="s2">to those issues right that maybe they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.410" end="01:03:25.710" style="s2">got any skin in the game on those issues</p>

<p begin="01:05:31.500" end="01:05:35.880" style="s2">that&#39;s right I think that&#39;s true you got</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:39.390" style="s2">Donald Trump saying that the the gay</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.880" end="01:05:42.240" style="s2">marriage is settled law mmm and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.390" end="01:05:44.130" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of social</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.240" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">issues that have sort of fallen to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.130" end="01:05:47.310" style="s2">side now because they become settled</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:49.470" style="s2">like gay marriage has been settled and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.310" end="01:05:52.140" style="s2">that was one thing gay marriage and pot</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.470" end="01:05:54.329" style="s2">and like the drug war it was like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.140" end="01:05:56.670" style="s2">like two issues that really kept me</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.329" end="01:06:00.180" style="s2">solidly on the left for a note for a</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.670" end="01:06:02.130" style="s2">long time yeah and once those have been</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.180" end="01:06:05.460" style="s2">you know the gay marriage is resolved</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.130" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">and pot decriminalization seems imminent</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.460" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">right it could it could be now it could</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:10.859" style="s2">be in five years but the trends seem to</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:13.740" style="s2">be solidly in place that that to me</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.859" end="01:06:15.990" style="s2">opened up the ability for me to make a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.740" end="01:06:17.599" style="s2">transition and of course you couple it</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.990" end="01:06:19.530" style="s2">with like the craziness</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.599" end="01:06:21.900" style="s2">coming out of the Democrats I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.530" end="01:06:27.030" style="s2">Democrats themselves are making it</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.900" end="01:06:29.010" style="s2">impossible for a white masculine male to</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.030" end="01:06:32.460" style="s2">remain a part of their coalition there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.010" end="01:06:36.030" style="s2">like absolutely no no self honestly no</p>

<p begin="01:06:42.420" end="01:06:47.280" style="s2">and spreads a message of hate and anti</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.940" end="01:06:49.859" style="s2">masculinity and anti white guy right I</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.280" end="01:06:52.109" style="s2">agree yeah and it sounds crazy to say</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.859" end="01:06:53.640" style="s2">that but have there been recent events</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.109" end="01:06:55.589" style="s2">or have you always sort of felt like</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.640" end="01:06:57.450" style="s2">that or what&#39;s driven you to come to</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.589" end="01:06:58.619" style="s2">that conclusion because I know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.450" end="01:07:00.960" style="s2">been for me I mean it&#39;s just sort like</p>

<p begin="01:07:00.960" end="01:07:04.650" style="s2">that I had that lived experience in</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.190" end="01:07:06.900" style="s2">college debate where like I was a soul</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.650" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">alone kind of libertarian moderate</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.900" end="01:07:10.079" style="s2">conservative around nothing but hyper</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:11.730" style="s2">liberals and you know there was a time</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.079" end="01:07:12.960" style="s2">where it was fine it was really policy</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.730" end="01:07:14.040" style="s2">centric debate and we were having</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.960" end="01:07:15.720" style="s2">disagreements about health care</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.040" end="01:07:17.370" style="s2">and gun reform and so whatever you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.720" end="01:07:20.100" style="s2">those are just technocratic issues but</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.370" end="01:07:21.930" style="s2">at a certain point things changed and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.100" end="01:07:23.340" style="s2">they got to a point where I was</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.930" end="01:07:25.110" style="s2">routinely being called racist and</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.340" end="01:07:27.180" style="s2">debates without justification</p>

<p begin="01:07:31.830" end="01:07:34.770" style="s2">saying and I was being very careful with</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.970" end="01:07:37.470" style="s2">it like if you call those things racist</p>

<p begin="01:07:41.490" end="01:07:46.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a can of worms</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.600" end="01:07:48.690" style="s2">yeah like that&#39;s one example and also</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.590" end="01:07:51.060" style="s2">just sort of a move in debate towards</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.690" end="01:07:54.210" style="s2">this I&#39;d just kind of lyin ization of</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.060" end="01:07:56.190" style="s2">victimhood and the arguments that were</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.210" end="01:07:59.100" style="s2">unbeatable because they were so woke</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.190" end="01:08:01.380" style="s2">right like the idea you know topic might</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.100" end="01:08:03.000" style="s2">be a policy debate about prosecutorial</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.380" end="01:08:06.390" style="s2">authority deferring to get up and say</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.000" end="01:08:08.130" style="s2">debate is racist it is anti black here</p>

<p begin="01:15:37.220" end="01:15:42.770" style="s2">mildly ignorant and I&#39;ll use in a</p>

<p begin="01:15:48.820" end="01:15:53.090" style="s2">propaganda campaigns to make us all</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.050" end="01:15:56.450" style="s2">believe we&#39;re Americans it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.090" end="01:15:58.150" style="s2">ethnic erasure and racism and all this</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.450" end="01:16:00.120" style="s2">horrible stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.150" end="01:16:04.570" style="s2">you know talk talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.120" end="01:16:06.250" style="s2">your experiences with with alright what</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.380" end="01:16:15.850" style="s2">like the alt-right is an umbrella group</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I think almost nobody</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.850" end="01:16:19.300" style="s2">identifies with the name anymore even</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:21.640" style="s2">the white nationalists are like you</p>

<p begin="01:16:27.969" end="01:16:31.840" style="s2">cool name right it&#39;s too bad that they</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.040" end="01:16:33.580" style="s2">you know Richard Spencer decided no I</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.840" end="01:16:35.590" style="s2">own this cool name and here let me get a</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.580" end="01:16:37.210" style="s2">Nazi goop all over alright like</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.590" end="01:16:38.500" style="s2">understanding the phenomena of Nazi goop</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.210" end="01:16:40.239" style="s2">is actually quite useful right like</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.500" end="01:16:42.989" style="s2">these people getting these people get</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.239" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">Nazi goop over things it&#39;s pretty bad</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.989" end="01:16:49.600" style="s2">the white nationalists won&#39;t won&#39;t hang</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:51.580" style="s2">out with you all right now won&#39;t hang</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.600" end="01:16:53.350" style="s2">out with the nail let&#39;s yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.580" end="01:16:55.150" style="s2">such a it&#39;s such a fine fine line to</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.350" end="01:16:58.659" style="s2">walk so yeah so I mean basically I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.150" end="01:17:00.730" style="s2">the alright has come to mean people that</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.659" end="01:17:03.190" style="s2">are very specifically oriented around</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.730" end="01:17:04.179" style="s2">some sort of ethnicity or wishing and</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.190" end="01:17:07.270" style="s2">this is time back our original</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.179" end="01:17:09.250" style="s2">conversation here it wishing that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.270" end="01:17:13.770" style="s2">binds that held their nation together</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.250" end="01:17:17.140" style="s2">were of ethnic origin rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.770" end="01:17:19.090" style="s2">cultural consciousness I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.140" end="01:17:20.800" style="s2">actually the most charitable way anybody</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.090" end="01:17:22.750" style="s2">ever defined right right they think I</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.800" end="01:17:27.340" style="s2">mean they believe that most real and</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.750" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">central and that essential to national</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.340" end="01:17:31.630" style="s2">identity like they reject the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:34.060" style="s2">distinction I think between the nation</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.630" end="01:17:35.500" style="s2">and the race that makes up the nation</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.060" end="01:17:37.000" style="s2">whereas I think that distinction is</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.500" end="01:17:39.130" style="s2">exceedingly important and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.000" end="01:17:40.390" style="s2">also I reject the premise inherent in</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.130" end="01:17:42.820" style="s2">that which is the idea that a nation</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.390" end="01:17:44.140" style="s2">can&#39;t be multi-ethnic right right like I</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.820" end="01:17:45.909" style="s2">think America is very clearly a</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.140" end="01:17:47.650" style="s2">multi-ethnic nation and a multi-ethnic</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.909" end="01:17:50.500" style="s2">country and that an ethnic nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.650" end="01:17:52.570" style="s2">in is America is unamerican right it</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.500" end="01:17:53.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit into our history and into</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.570" end="01:17:55.330" style="s2">our understanding of ourselves well</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.980" end="01:17:57.670" style="s2">right and then if you&#39;re just gonna like</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.330" end="01:18:00.070" style="s2">judge the performance of this American</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.670" end="01:18:01.300" style="s2">consciousness on the global scale I mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.070" end="01:18:03.540" style="s2">how else would you do it besides like</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.300" end="01:18:05.940" style="s2">GDP and the military power so like</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.540" end="01:18:08.170" style="s2">whatever we have living here in America</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.940" end="01:18:09.440" style="s2">remember who&#39;s been who members been</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.170" end="01:18:12.520" style="s2">here for the last however</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.440" end="01:18:14.900" style="s2">200 plus years it&#39;s obviously working</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.520" end="01:18:16.940" style="s2">right so to say that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.900" end="01:18:20.900" style="s2">impractical or non-functional or</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.940" end="01:18:23.830" style="s2">sub-optimal either on a political skill</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.900" end="01:18:26.840" style="s2">on economic skill or even on a</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.830" end="01:18:29.210" style="s2">evolutionary scale would be completely</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.840" end="01:18:30.739" style="s2">false right so so when people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.210" end="01:18:32.150" style="s2">talking about ethno States they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.739" end="01:18:34.550" style="s2">really talking about suboptimal</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.150" end="01:18:35.870" style="s2">suboptimal outcomes right no I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.550" end="01:18:37.370" style="s2">mean it would be disastrous Maranon</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.870" end="01:18:39.860" style="s2">talking suboptimal I mean the breakup of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.370" end="01:18:41.750" style="s2">the United States and two distinct</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.860" end="01:18:44.270" style="s2">ethnic nations would lead to both</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.750" end="01:18:45.860" style="s2">internal war and also a collapse of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.270" end="01:18:47.330" style="s2">world order I mean you know the entire</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.860" end="01:18:49.400" style="s2">world order is routed around the United</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.330" end="01:18:51.350" style="s2">States as the dominant superpower right</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.400" end="01:18:54.140" style="s2">so this nation this notion is</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.350" end="01:18:55.610" style="s2">absurd is the end of this yeah it is and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.140" end="01:18:57.620" style="s2">it was from from the get-go another</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.610" end="01:18:59.180" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of modifying it there their</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.620" end="01:19:01.489" style="s2">argument is more well we need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.180" end="01:19:03.890" style="s2">maintain a white supermajority in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.489" end="01:19:07.460" style="s2">United States and for me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.890" end="01:19:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually a relevant metric in</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.460" end="01:19:12.770" style="s2">my judgment at all right like to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.680" end="01:19:15.380" style="s2">like you know America doesn&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.770" end="01:19:17.600" style="s2">America it&#39;s going to depend on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.380" end="01:19:19.280" style="s2">ideology right it&#39;s going to depend on</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.600" end="01:19:20.960" style="s2">the dominance of particular political</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.280" end="01:19:22.790" style="s2">factions it&#39;s not going to depend on</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.960" end="01:19:24.140" style="s2">whether or not you&#39;re counting members</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.790" end="01:19:25.900" style="s2">of a particular race and seeing that</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.140" end="01:19:29.930" style="s2">they add up to the right number</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.900" end="01:19:34.270" style="s2">especially because like just you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.930" end="01:19:37.219" style="s2">like white people aren&#39;t unified at all</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.270" end="01:19:40.010" style="s2">at all there are completely different</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.219" end="01:19:42.500" style="s2">tribes right but I think what we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.010" end="01:19:45.050" style="s2">though in the voting is that by and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.500" end="01:19:47.480" style="s2">large the minority groups are unified in</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.050" end="01:19:49.880" style="s2">their voting and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.480" end="01:19:51.830" style="s2">characteristics a unified unifies them</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.880" end="01:19:53.870" style="s2">at least there some of their woke up air</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.830" end="01:19:56.060" style="s2">quotes again that&#39;s really effective on</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.870" end="01:20:01.100" style="s2">a podcast using air quotes or facial</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.060" end="01:20:03.530" style="s2">expressions or eye rolls especially is</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.100" end="01:20:08.350" style="s2">that you know sort of an opposition to</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.530" end="01:20:10.460" style="s2">white power or white head roni hegemony</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.350" end="01:20:12.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s bad for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.460" end="01:20:13.820" style="s2">project of American nationalism right</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.199" end="01:20:15.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a censorship competing ethnic</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.820" end="01:20:17.420" style="s2">nationalisms which is it&#39;s almost what</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.830" end="01:20:19.070" style="s2">that reflects a kind of descent into</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.420" end="01:20:21.679" style="s2">competing ethnic nationalism correct</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.070" end="01:20:22.710" style="s2">right so I my point and even bringing</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.679" end="01:20:25.140" style="s2">this up is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.710" end="01:20:27.739" style="s2">the Democrat the Democratic Party has in</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.140" end="01:20:30.570" style="s2">its coalition people who are ethnically</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.739" end="01:20:33.120" style="s2">oriented in their approach to politics</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.570" end="01:20:35.280" style="s2">right and so one of the questions I</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.120" end="01:20:37.140" style="s2">asked in my book and I think this might</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.280" end="01:20:40.590" style="s2">be one of the more dangerous things that</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.140" end="01:20:44.040" style="s2">I did bring up is that if people in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.590" end="01:20:46.890" style="s2">minority parties are gleefully</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.040" end="01:20:51.030" style="s2">anticipating in the moment at which they</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.890" end="01:20:55.050" style="s2">become a majority voting bloc what is</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.030" end="01:20:57.360" style="s2">driving that that Glee and you know what</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.050" end="01:20:59.400" style="s2">what does that mean so like you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.360" end="01:21:01.500" style="s2">said and I&#39;ve said and have thought as</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.400" end="01:21:03.150" style="s2">well to that like maintaining an right</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.500" end="01:21:06.810" style="s2">position which is not our position of</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.150" end="01:21:08.489" style="s2">maintaining a white super majority or</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.810" end="01:21:11.190" style="s2">majority voting power in the United</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.489" end="01:21:12.750" style="s2">States is important and we&#39;re saying no</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.190" end="01:21:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not important this idea is an</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.750" end="01:21:15.989" style="s2">ideology right because white people</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.920" end="01:21:17.850" style="s2">aren&#39;t unified but on the on the other</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.989" end="01:21:19.260" style="s2">side you there&#39;s there&#39;s minority groups</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.850" end="01:21:23.310" style="s2">that are like can&#39;t wait till we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.260" end="01:21:24.600" style="s2">voting power now is that is that is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.310" end="01:21:26.340" style="s2">something to you know when is that gonna</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.600" end="01:21:27.870" style="s2">happen is there is there a negative</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.340" end="01:21:31.560" style="s2">effects to that is that I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.870" end="01:21:33.750" style="s2">elevating ethnic division to a national</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.560" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">level on a policymaking level right and</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.750" end="01:21:39.380" style="s2">so the way I frame it again in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:42.360" style="s2">ideology if your ideology is one of</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.380" end="01:21:43.770" style="s2">ethnic solidarity and waiting to triumph</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.360" end="01:21:45.960" style="s2">over white people then your ideology</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.770" end="01:21:49.020" style="s2">needs to be marginalized you know and</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.960" end="01:21:52.260" style="s2">moreover like if your political strategy</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.020" end="01:21:56.730" style="s2">is to change immigration patterns to to</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.260" end="01:21:58.440" style="s2">increase the essentially to like change</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.730" end="01:22:00.570" style="s2">change the demographic situation so that</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.440" end="01:22:02.850" style="s2">you&#39;re going to win your this ethnic</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.570" end="01:22:06.060" style="s2">battle it&#39;s like no we that can&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.850" end="01:22:08.160" style="s2">not okay right and that&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.060" end="01:22:09.930" style="s2">we want to prevent anything like that</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.160" end="01:22:11.310" style="s2">from it right of course which is why</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.930" end="01:22:13.290" style="s2">which is why I think we both were</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.310" end="01:22:15.390" style="s2">talking earlier and and something we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.290" end="01:22:18.120" style="s2">considered quite a bit which is how do</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.390" end="01:22:20.100" style="s2">we how do we strengthen and fortify the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.120" end="01:22:22.140" style="s2">American consciousness in a unified</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.100" end="01:22:23.910" style="s2">manner mm-hmm and what does that look</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.140" end="01:22:25.200" style="s2">you know these are just rhetorical</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.910" end="01:22:26.850" style="s2">questions but like what does that look</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.200" end="01:22:28.590" style="s2">like how are we gonna do that moving</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.850" end="01:22:30.719" style="s2">forward is it something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.590" end="01:22:32.010" style="s2">coordinated on the federal level is it</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.719" end="01:22:35.150" style="s2">something that people do philanthropic</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.010" end="01:22:36.620" style="s2">lis you know do you do it on Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.150" end="01:22:39.860" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s just a ton of like</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.620" end="01:22:42.110" style="s2">cultural work to be done about changing</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.860" end="01:22:44.300" style="s2">the attitudes of this country and</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.110" end="01:22:48.020" style="s2">basically making everybody American</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.300" end="01:22:51.110" style="s2">right like and and really putting these</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.020" end="01:22:53.929" style="s2">sort of quasi ethnic nationalist</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.110" end="01:22:56.060" style="s2">splinter groups making them marginal</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.929" end="01:22:58.969" style="s2">right making them toxic making it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.060" end="01:23:00.890" style="s2">no that&#39;s yes I realize like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.969" end="01:23:02.300" style="s2">powerful driver is like ah we as a</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.890" end="01:23:04.100" style="s2">voting bloc love power but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.300" end="01:23:06.110" style="s2">that&#39;s just not an American way of</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.100" end="01:23:08.510" style="s2">thinking no you&#39;re just not and it</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.110" end="01:23:10.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sit with our values no you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.510" end="01:23:11.870" style="s2">I find it ironic that the very same</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.280" end="01:23:13.790" style="s2">people that would criticize others for</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.870" end="01:23:15.380" style="s2">having an ethnic perspective or also</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.790" end="01:23:16.940" style="s2">then gonna bring sort of ethnicity to</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.380" end="01:23:18.350" style="s2">their forefront of their conversation as</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.940" end="01:23:21.170" style="s2">well too but yeah that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.350" end="01:23:23.210" style="s2">conversation for another day so I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.170" end="01:23:25.340" style="s2">this is a good place to begin to wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.210" end="01:23:26.929" style="s2">because if anything comes out of this</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.340" end="01:23:28.280" style="s2">conversation what I what I want people</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.929" end="01:23:30.650" style="s2">to take away from and said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.280" end="01:23:32.659" style="s2">important for us to to foster the</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.650" end="01:23:35.060" style="s2">American consciousness that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.659" end="01:23:37.640" style="s2">important for us to have like a unified</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.060" end="01:23:39.800" style="s2">idea of who we are and where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.640" end="01:23:42.949" style="s2">and what we&#39;re doing whether its</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.800" end="01:23:46.070" style="s2">language culture customs attitudes</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.949" end="01:23:46.969" style="s2">expectations norms etc and of course</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.070" end="01:23:48.469" style="s2">along the way we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.969" end="01:23:49.909" style="s2">vigorous and healthy to base when we</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.469" end="01:23:52.070" style="s2">don&#39;t have the vigorous and healthy</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.909" end="01:23:54.020" style="s2">debate when somebody like me gets the</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.070" end="01:23:56.000" style="s2">platformed and banned from just having a</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.020" end="01:23:58.460" style="s2">regular conversation at a federally</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.000" end="01:24:02.800" style="s2">federally funded university you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.460" end="01:24:06.290" style="s2">with law students with laws particularly</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.800" end="01:24:08.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not just some college you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.290" end="01:24:09.890" style="s2">undergrads right and I was looking</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.090" end="01:24:11.420" style="s2">forward to talking to the law students</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.890" end="01:24:13.310" style="s2">too because I wanted to get deeper into</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.420" end="01:24:15.140" style="s2">some federal policy and how it changes</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.310" end="01:24:16.640" style="s2">human behavior like the way title 9</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.140" end="01:24:19.130" style="s2">stretches all the way into college</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.640" end="01:24:20.360" style="s2">relationships and mating and dating</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.130" end="01:24:21.620" style="s2">patterns and whatnot because I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.360" end="01:24:23.210" style="s2">that&#39;s fascinating conversation</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.620" end="01:24:25.250" style="s2">something I&#39;ve actually talked a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.210" end="01:24:27.620" style="s2">about with Jeffrey Miller on episode</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.250" end="01:24:28.880" style="s2">number one so check that out but you</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.620" end="01:24:31.280" style="s2">know the walk away from this the</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.880" end="01:24:35.210" style="s2">takeaway is that you know American</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.280" end="01:24:37.790" style="s2">nationalism is is a good thing to say</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.210" end="01:24:39.800" style="s2">that it is inherently evil or Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.790" end="01:24:43.400" style="s2">asked like those those young young</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.800" end="01:24:44.960" style="s2">bunnies on CNN 26 years old doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.400" end="01:24:45.570" style="s2">anything about anything but knows you</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.960" end="01:24:47.250" style="s2">know thinks you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.570" end="01:24:50.130" style="s2">enough to say that being a nationalist</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.250" end="01:24:51.420" style="s2">is being a Nazi you know we want to we</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.130" end="01:24:53.190" style="s2">want to move away from that type of</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.420" end="01:24:55.920" style="s2">rhetoric and and I think that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.190" end="01:24:59.340" style="s2">a good talk here to really talk to dig</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.920" end="01:25:01.619" style="s2">into what nationalism means what the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.340" end="01:25:04.800" style="s2">American consciousness is and and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.619" end="01:25:07.949" style="s2">importance of it and the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.800" end="01:25:09.659" style="s2">unifying evolutionary perspective of</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.949" end="01:25:11.159" style="s2">like taking care of yourself first so</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.659" end="01:25:12.810" style="s2">that you can then also take care of</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.159" end="01:25:15.480" style="s2">people outside of your outside of your</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.810" end="01:25:17.340" style="s2">circles and you know I know for me</p>

<p begin="01:25:25.320" end="01:25:29.099" style="s2">a sudden sounds super concerned hold</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.210" end="01:25:31.170" style="s2">school right like a strong father or</p>

<p begin="01:25:31.170" end="01:25:35.639" style="s2">community then we can help everybody</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.270" end="01:25:37.530" style="s2">else and and we lead through strength</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.639" end="01:25:38.639" style="s2">and we lead through conviction and we</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.530" end="01:25:41.730" style="s2">lead through having a hearty</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.639" end="01:25:43.829" style="s2">Constitution and you know that notion is</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.730" end="01:25:46.770" style="s2">under attack from all aspects so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.829" end="01:25:50.159" style="s2">no surprise to me or to you that the</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.770" end="01:25:51.869" style="s2">Marxist globalists you unit union that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.159" end="01:25:53.670" style="s2">out there that they would all be on one</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.869" end="01:25:56.090" style="s2">side and on folks on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.670" end="01:25:58.650" style="s2">advocating a positive masculinity</p>

<p begin="01:26:02.880" end="01:26:05.429" style="s2">then in turn you can worry about</p>

<p begin="01:26:05.429" end="01:26:09.060" style="s2">you know those dividing lines are pretty</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.469" end="01:26:11.639" style="s2">clear and when you lay it out like that</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.060" end="01:26:14.369" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s really obvious the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.639" end="01:26:16.560" style="s2">divisions right and and how they seem</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.369" end="01:26:19.079" style="s2">they seem to be very very entrenched and</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.560" end="01:26:20.070" style="s2">so that&#39;s why communication is good and</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.079" end="01:26:22.500" style="s2">that&#39;s why getting out there and talking</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.070" end="01:26:24.570" style="s2">to people is good but that&#39;s gonna be it</p>
