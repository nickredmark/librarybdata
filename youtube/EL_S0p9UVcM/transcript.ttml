<p begin="00:00:08.109" end="00:00:16.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s a vastly more popular sense</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.250" end="00:00:27.730" style="s2">right and the short answer is is because</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.220" end="00:00:30.789" style="s2">the the envelope in which we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.730" end="00:00:33.400" style="s2">held the I will call it the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.789" end="00:00:35.950" style="s2">structure the the institutions that</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.930" end="00:00:48.550" style="s2">you&#39;re agreeing with the interviewers</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:50.770" style="s2">proposition that climate change was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.550" end="00:00:54.790" style="s2">thing or something that like we have it</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">White Walkers is not climate change</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.490" end="00:01:26.680" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of the white walkers is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:28.600" style="s2">when civilization Falls things get</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.680" end="00:01:29.560" style="s2">uncomfortable that&#39;s not a good thing we</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.960" end="00:01:46.659" style="s2">from the point of view of the childish</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.159" end="00:01:48.700" style="s2">things what that means is it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.659" end="00:01:50.680" style="s2">die mmm from the point of view of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.700" end="00:01:51.280" style="s2">South that is continue to go on is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.680" end="00:01:52.810" style="s2">time to grow up</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.280" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">all right that&#39;s just always happened</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.810" end="00:01:56.710" style="s2">that&#39;s just what it means for change to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:59.049" style="s2">occur some things literally just die</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.710" end="00:02:00.070" style="s2">they go away forever in Tunis Hill well</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.049" end="00:02:03.190" style="s2">in this case what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.070" end="00:02:04.690" style="s2">is that gigantic chunks of what we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.190" end="00:02:07.030" style="s2">thought it was kind of being the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.690" end="00:02:08.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve had this weird model that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.030" end="00:02:09.910" style="s2">notion that when you&#39;re six you go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.470" end="00:02:11.260" style="s2">kindergarten then you kind of toil</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.910" end="00:02:12.340" style="s2">through primary school and then you go</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.260" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">to high school and you go to college and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.340" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">they get a job is the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">all right and it&#39;s not and that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">away all right so what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">that people are perceiving because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">becoming increasingly obvious that all</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">of these artifacts of the way that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:27.209" style="s2">gone about doing civilization in all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">different ways like pick your poison is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.209" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">really matter because they&#39;re all kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">of tied together are breaking down and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:35.820" style="s2">failing in a way that is no longer easy</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">to pretend isn&#39;t happening and so as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.820" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">consequence this triggers a deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.489" style="s2">visceral sense and that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.750" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">right because that deep visceral sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.489" end="00:02:45.209" style="s2">is the return to the unlimited the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.410" end="00:02:47.070" style="s2">return to the mystery the return to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.209" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">the state which by the way in folks is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.070" end="00:02:51.030" style="s2">conversation human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">encountered this problem before we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.030" end="00:02:54.510" style="s2">been in living in the valley yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:56.459" style="s2">had a situation where the the drought</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.510" end="00:02:57.830" style="s2">has come and we need to leave well how</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.459" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">we deal with that is first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.830" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">we drop the parts of us that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">stay where we are we allow the sadness</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:08.370" style="s2">of change to occur and we process that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:10.019" style="s2">we feel something bad has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.370" end="00:03:12.090" style="s2">danger is just emerged for sure like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.019" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2">leaving the the old fertile valley and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.090" end="00:03:15.239" style="s2">migrating across the desert is fraught</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.890" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">with danger and some of us may not make</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.239" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">but at the same time it activates in us</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">as well the call to consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">call to gather together the call to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">begin to actually become thinking in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:32.370" style="s2">group and then into an adventure find</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">your heroes find your courage find your</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.370" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">your role by who you are in this place</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">and get deeply good at it find out how</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:39.690" style="s2">to build real relationships with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:41.250" style="s2">people around you have trust and have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.690" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">the power and binding you get across</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.250" end="00:03:45.030" style="s2">that desert no matter what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:46.739" style="s2">then go and on this case did this had is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.030" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">paradise or at least something really</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.739" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">awesome like it may not expect that will</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">in fact be a terminus and then end I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:54.329" style="s2">think it&#39;ll be more in the direction if</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">we get to go to Mars but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.329" end="00:03:57.989" style="s2">God level it&#39;s another it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">other level that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.989" end="00:04:01.380" style="s2">- a whole load of the that we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:02.600" style="s2">just dealing with before because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.380" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">thought that&#39;s just what the world was</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.600" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">yeah and it won&#39;t be there anymore that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:10.739" style="s2">means liquid saying earlier about each</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">sort of level generation less miserable</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.739" end="00:04:16.500" style="s2">crap to deal with you have this huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">space in which you can be mighty yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.500" end="00:04:20.910" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s um what is the metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">that what we haven&#39;t we have a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.910" end="00:04:24.539" style="s2">in biology it is the transition from</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.729" style="s2">caterpillar to butterfly is the</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">you seem to lean more towards a idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.590" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">that we are doomed</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:43.350" style="s2">you mentioned the setting you tell that</p>

<p begin="00:05:29.190" end="00:05:33.540" style="s2">decentralization so we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">like the democratization of media in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.540" end="00:05:36.270" style="s2">very positive sense and of course I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:37.410" style="s2">guess if you&#39;re currently in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.270" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">mass media it&#39;s negative but for</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">everybody else is mostly positive and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">can even talk about like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">democratization of genetic engineering</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:46.680" style="s2">in a positive sense there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:48.060" style="s2">powerful stuff that comes out of it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.680" end="00:05:51.560" style="s2">also there&#39;s a negative sense which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.060" end="00:05:54.690" style="s2">that the things that used to be very</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:57.800" style="s2">rare and used to be easy to control</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.690" end="00:06:01.530" style="s2">because they were so rare as they become</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.800" end="00:06:03.170" style="s2">widely available and still powerful you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.530" end="00:06:05.700" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s the kind of thing where</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.170" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">until and unless we invent some new way</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.700" end="00:06:08.850" style="s2">of dealing with that if we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:11.480" style="s2">trying to manage it with the old</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.850" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">techniques they are very very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.480" end="00:06:17.850" style="s2">and when I guess for me that the real</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">the key inside is just is just this up</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.850" end="00:06:22.070" style="s2">until I think I may we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:24.450" style="s2">this before but up until about 1947</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.070" end="00:06:26.520" style="s2">human beings really couldn&#39;t it up</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.450" end="00:06:28.590" style="s2">and disease could come and kill us or</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">you know family and can wipe us out but</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.590" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">even if we ward like crazy that World</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:34.380" style="s2">War 2 style war just a tiniest blip in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.270" end="00:06:36.150" style="s2">our population even the Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.380" end="00:06:38.700" style="s2">collapse which took out like seven major</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.150" end="00:06:41.470" style="s2">civilizations still effectively non no</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.700" end="00:06:44.590" style="s2">effect at all and the human</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.470" end="00:06:46.480" style="s2">but around 1948 when the u.s. and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.590" end="00:06:47.830" style="s2">Soviets both had H bombs we started</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.480" end="00:06:49.600" style="s2">moving into the zone where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.830" end="00:06:51.100" style="s2">could it up for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.600" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">like we could kill everybody and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.100" end="00:06:56.170" style="s2">just a new state and of course in 1948</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:57.490" style="s2">that consciousness was a big deal like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.170" end="00:06:58.630" style="s2">oh wow this is this is a big deal we</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.490" end="00:07:02.020" style="s2">need to be very careful about it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.630" end="00:07:03.940" style="s2">over the next 50 or so years we got kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.020" end="00:07:05.530" style="s2">of okay at not getting everybody killed</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.940" end="00:07:06.460" style="s2">me remember there&#39;s some dodgy moments</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.530" end="00:07:09.100" style="s2">there in the Middle where it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.460" end="00:07:10.870" style="s2">it might not work out but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.100" end="00:07:12.700" style="s2">was actually relatively small like we</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.870" end="00:07:14.380" style="s2">literally all we had to do was prevent</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.700" end="00:07:16.390" style="s2">in this case five or six people around</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.380" end="00:07:17.980" style="s2">the world who were pretty well known</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.390" end="00:07:20.500" style="s2">like the leaders of Nations and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.980" end="00:07:22.660" style="s2">well monitored from pushing the button</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.500" end="00:07:23.710" style="s2">simultaneously like even if just one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.660" end="00:07:25.030" style="s2">us push the button and we could probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.710" end="00:07:27.580" style="s2">still make it so we didn&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.030" end="00:07:29.700" style="s2">the problem but as technology has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.580" end="00:07:33.100" style="s2">more powerful and more decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.700" end="00:07:34.870" style="s2">things like cyber warfare is a simple</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.100" end="00:07:36.040" style="s2">example 15 years ago cyber warfare</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.870" end="00:07:38.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter that much</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.040" end="00:07:40.900" style="s2">who cares if a hacker shuts down the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.620" end="00:07:42.640" style="s2">computing grid in a major city but as</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.900" end="00:07:43.990" style="s2">things like our electric systems and our</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.640" end="00:07:45.340" style="s2">water systems and maybe even our</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.990" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2">automotive transportation systems are</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.340" end="00:07:49.060" style="s2">all on a computer grid one hacker one</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:51.940" style="s2">unhappy hacker in one location could</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.060" end="00:07:53.740" style="s2">shut down an entire city and that could</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.940" end="00:07:55.090" style="s2">generate actual chaos like the cities</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.740" end="00:07:57.160" style="s2">are large and the ability to rebuilt it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.090" end="00:07:58.600" style="s2">might being very hard and that&#39;s to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.160" end="00:08:01.690" style="s2">nothing of something like say CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.600" end="00:08:03.160" style="s2">where that same group of kids maybe 20</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.690" end="00:08:07.330" style="s2">well-resourced PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.160" end="00:08:09.430" style="s2">could build a super gene virus that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.330" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">could wipe out a billion people and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.430" end="00:08:12.760" style="s2">that&#39;s unprecedented right and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.950" style="s2">happening is is that the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.760" end="00:08:17.260" style="s2">the risk is now existential we can now</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.950" end="00:08:18.820" style="s2">kill everybody and the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.260" end="00:08:21.220" style="s2">that are in that magnitude are</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.820" end="00:08:24.280" style="s2">proliferating and the difficulty getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.220" end="00:08:26.350" style="s2">access to it is going down so that Ark</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.280" end="00:08:28.690" style="s2">is a very bad arc like that that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.350" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">story ends badly in every in every in</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.690" end="00:08:33.280" style="s2">every every way you tell it it ends</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:34.870" style="s2">badly which is not by the way that say</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.280" end="00:08:36.730" style="s2">that&#39;s tight it told many times as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.870" end="00:08:38.710" style="s2">that&#39;s true is the thing yeah we have we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.730" end="00:08:41.590" style="s2">have heard it&#39;s kind of this story we</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.710" end="00:08:43.930" style="s2">heard the most through like the sixties</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.590" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">through to semi recently right was this</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.930" end="00:08:49.210" style="s2">the consciousness of tapping into that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:51.370" style="s2">deep the deepest of mythos of wait a min</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.210" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">we have as humans as a species we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.370" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">witnessed moments that at least to our</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:55.459" style="s2">local try</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:08:59.300" style="s2">we&#39;re apocalyptic we&#39;ve had situations</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.459" end="00:09:00.709" style="s2">where we all starve to death we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.300" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">had a flood where something really</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.709" end="00:09:04.459" style="s2">seriously back something so bad happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.350" style="s2">that we still know about it 2,000 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.459" end="00:09:09.529" style="s2">years later so we have that and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.350" end="00:09:12.500" style="s2">nuclear war raised that energy and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.529" end="00:09:14.510" style="s2">the positive side of the story is we</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.500" end="00:09:16.070" style="s2">have that in us we have in us the notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.510" end="00:09:17.899" style="s2">that that&#39;s the thing that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.070" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">we also have the notion of what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.899" end="00:09:22.220" style="s2">right answer is we know how to respond</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">to it at least mythopoetic Lee and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.220" end="00:09:26.149" style="s2">guess sort of your side of this story</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:27.709" style="s2">which I bother would completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.149" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">with and believe in him that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.709" end="00:09:31.459" style="s2">care about is focusing on going there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">that there&#39;s a mirror image yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.459" end="00:09:36.110" style="s2">these same powers can be used for good</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:38.570" style="s2">yes the difference I think right now is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.110" end="00:09:41.060" style="s2">that up until recently they could be</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.570" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">used for good now they must be used for</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:46.760" style="s2">good yes which is which is I mean kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:48.829" style="s2">of an imperative for us to transcend to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.760" end="00:09:52.579" style="s2">the level we need to get to to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.829" end="00:09:55.639" style="s2">the species that we could be you need</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.579" end="00:09:58.279" style="s2">those kind of stakes mm-hmm I like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.639" end="00:10:00.620" style="s2">in our direction yeah yeah and in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.279" end="00:10:04.180" style="s2">old balance no light without shadow etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.620" end="00:10:07.790" style="s2">and no hero without the balanced villain</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.180" end="00:10:10.790" style="s2">you need that motivation to be greater</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.790" end="00:10:13.160" style="s2">and to go further and to be a better</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.790" end="00:10:14.360" style="s2">version of yourself and you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.160" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">better version of all of us together</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.360" end="00:10:20.779" style="s2">because as you&#39;ve talked about it takes</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:23.750" style="s2">all of us working way harder and making</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.779" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">all of us way better together to be able</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.750" end="00:10:27.500" style="s2">to combat those things nice I like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.350" style="s2">so if you can imagine like taking these</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.500" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">these forces these these places that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.350" end="00:10:35.930" style="s2">could go these poles of Heaven and Hell</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:40.250" style="s2">right these intense moment modes and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.930" end="00:10:42.620" style="s2">then try to turn them into a tool as you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.250" end="00:10:45.589" style="s2">say that because motivation that the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.620" end="00:10:48.139" style="s2">prospect that this hell is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.589" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">that lies in our future unless and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.139" end="00:10:52.490" style="s2">prospect of this thing human is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:54.709" style="s2">that lives in our future if and if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.490" end="00:10:56.360" style="s2">can find a way to build in yourself the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.709" end="00:10:59.449" style="s2">capacity to relate to it in that fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.360" end="00:11:02.269" style="s2">meaning allow the notion of the prospect</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.449" end="00:11:04.760" style="s2">of Hell unless to be a motivator not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.269" end="00:11:04.950" style="s2">demotivator which is what I do have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.760" end="00:11:07.530" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.950" end="00:11:08.690" style="s2">for a long time mm-hmm it kind of and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.530" end="00:11:13.650" style="s2">seems silly not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.690" end="00:11:16.920" style="s2">right yeah the the opposite leads to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.650" end="00:11:20.610" style="s2">what is it lead to misery and tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.920" end="00:11:23.100" style="s2">and sorrowing and cancer and death the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.610" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">opposite is a joyful existence in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.100" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">look around you look at this is glorious</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:28.380" style="s2"> that we exist in that couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:29.880" style="s2">even been dreamed of by people a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.380" end="00:11:31.950" style="s2">generations previous yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.880" end="00:11:33.810" style="s2">astounding isn&#39;t it like the the amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.950" end="00:11:35.310" style="s2">of beauty and joy that we can witness</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.810" end="00:11:38.280" style="s2">yeah just now</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.310" end="00:11:39.870" style="s2">much less that we could witness is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.280" end="00:11:41.520" style="s2">fact actually this town it is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.870" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">of thing that is only written about in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.520" end="00:11:46.200" style="s2">like poetry and mythology and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:47.880" style="s2">actually a present it&#39;s real yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:51.150" style="s2">is a day-to-day light time and what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.880" end="00:11:55.410" style="s2">find particularly encouraging is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.150" end="00:11:57.390" style="s2">someone starting from this position like</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.410" end="00:11:59.390" style="s2">I have a five year old kid I have a five</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.390" end="00:12:02.700" style="s2">year old boy called Hercules who plays</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.420" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">computer he has no limit to his</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.080" end="00:12:14.640" style="s2">imagination for creation he sees no end</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">point of where he can&#39;t sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.640" end="00:12:18.410" style="s2">create what&#39;s in his head and turn that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:21.930" style="s2">into a thing he lives in this lake</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.410" end="00:12:24.210" style="s2">glorious paradise that his ancestors had</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.930" end="00:12:26.250" style="s2">sort of sweated and died same as it gets</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.210" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">to the point of and like the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.250" end="00:12:31.170" style="s2">that would all sort of collapse just at</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:33.870" style="s2">that point of triumph kind of seems</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.170" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">silly like he and all of his little</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.870" end="00:12:37.770" style="s2">brothers and sisters and your kids who</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.930" end="00:13:05.190" style="s2">about these cultural sort of shifts we</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.640" end="00:13:08.010" style="s2">swing on a pendulum every 7 years</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.190" end="00:13:10.050" style="s2">between punk nihilism and psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.010" end="00:13:12.150" style="s2">sort of hippy optimism and then there</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.050" end="00:13:14.400" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen a grander scale the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.150" end="00:13:16.620" style="s2">time that swung was or at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.400" end="00:13:17.139" style="s2">2012 was the end of the last peak thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.620" end="00:13:18.910" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.139" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">people were talking about hey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.910" end="00:13:23.459" style="s2">staged alien invasions at the 2012</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.459" end="00:13:29.049" style="s2">then it all got then everyone sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.170" end="00:13:32.230" style="s2">descended into complaining about you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.049" end="00:13:33.759" style="s2">know invasions of foreigners and things</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.230" end="00:13:36.699" style="s2">of that nature we&#39;re going back into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.759" end="00:13:38.769" style="s2">psychedelic territory the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.699" end="00:13:41.699" style="s2">in this time is we&#39;ve been through many</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.769" end="00:13:45.220" style="s2">many sort of generations of rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.699" end="00:13:47.350" style="s2">against the old order as it reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.220" end="00:13:49.929" style="s2">of a spitting image sketch about Madonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.350" end="00:13:51.489" style="s2">sort of how much more naked could she</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.929" end="00:13:53.350" style="s2">get and then she pulls off all this skin</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.489" end="00:13:55.059" style="s2">but it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been through every</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.350" end="00:13:56.949" style="s2">kind of rebellion the most rebellious</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.059" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">thing you can do right now is take</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.949" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">personal responsibility commit to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:06.999" style="s2">person raise a family with that person</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:08.439" style="s2">invest yourself fully in them being the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.999" end="00:14:11.009" style="s2">best they can possibly be like</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.439" end="00:14:12.879" style="s2">wholesomeness is the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.009" end="00:14:14.859" style="s2">countercultural rebellious thing you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.879" end="00:14:16.179" style="s2">could do right now like wholesome</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.859" end="00:14:20.049" style="s2">earnest therefore wisdom ooh punk rock</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.179" end="00:14:22.839" style="s2">and what&#39;s dope about that is that fixes</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.049" end="00:14:24.549" style="s2">loads of problems if like on a mass sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.839" end="00:14:25.899" style="s2">of scale everyone&#39;s good going okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.549" end="00:14:27.989" style="s2">called the cool things to do right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.899" end="00:14:31.149" style="s2">is to take personal responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.989" end="00:14:33.129" style="s2">invest the time and energy in making</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.149" end="00:14:35.439" style="s2">myself the best version of myself I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.129" end="00:14:37.689" style="s2">possibly be if people are doing that on</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.439" end="00:14:39.189" style="s2">mass you don&#39;t even know what what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.689" end="00:14:41.410" style="s2">effects of that could be it&#39;s because it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.189" end="00:14:43.480" style="s2">hasn&#39;t happened before and because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.410" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">Internet is here you have this on a mass</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.480" end="00:14:49.480" style="s2">scale you have cultural icons like Ethan</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:53.129" style="s2">in healer at age three about to have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.480" end="00:14:56.319" style="s2">child and be the first sort of YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.129" end="00:14:58.329" style="s2">wholesome family this is like this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.319" end="00:15:01.509" style="s2">bigger than Mister Rogers this is way</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.329" end="00:15:03.879" style="s2">bigger than most artists this is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.509" end="00:15:05.709" style="s2">seeing this from this from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.879" end="00:15:07.660" style="s2">you see because these are two kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.709" end="00:15:09.220" style="s2">like Mimi edged lords kind of coming out</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.660" end="00:15:10.749" style="s2">of the counterculture like growing up</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.220" end="00:15:13.119" style="s2">and so we&#39;re in a place where the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.749" end="00:15:15.100" style="s2">like the the tyrannical the rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.119" end="00:15:17.289" style="s2">against the tyrannical king the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.100" end="00:15:19.869" style="s2">tyrannical king is quite obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.289" end="00:15:21.939" style="s2">in charge in a deep way right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.869" end="00:15:23.379" style="s2">was a phrase like Buddha died and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.939" end="00:15:25.269" style="s2">took a thousand years before his shadow</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.379" end="00:15:26.559" style="s2">was still being shown like yeah sure I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.269" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">get it we can we can still sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.559" end="00:15:30.369" style="s2">identify a simulacrum of a tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:30.970" style="s2">King and to be sure there are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.369" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">like powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.970" end="00:15:34.750" style="s2">bad guys out there with with power but</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:39.129" style="s2">the reality of the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.750" end="00:15:42.250" style="s2">people to just choose to enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.129" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">new way of being is well it&#39;s there it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.250" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">is simply there and the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:47.379" style="s2">I was thinking about is this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:50.230" style="s2">wholesomeness is so it&#39;s so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.379" end="00:15:52.110" style="s2">because there&#39;s when two different ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.230" end="00:15:55.149" style="s2">you can go about making a good choice</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.110" end="00:15:56.079" style="s2">like doing the right thing one way is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.149" end="00:15:57.579" style="s2">you can do the right thing because</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.079" end="00:16:00.759" style="s2">you&#39;ve been told it&#39;s the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.579" end="00:16:02.889" style="s2">do mm-hmm that&#39;s hard it sucks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.759" end="00:16:04.089" style="s2">fragile you&#39;re almost like struggling</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.889" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">against it you know it&#39;s like you eat</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.089" end="00:16:07.180" style="s2">your broccoli and what&#39;s gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:08.139" style="s2">happening is eventually you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.180" end="00:16:09.160" style="s2">grow up and you&#39;re not gonna eat your</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.139" end="00:16:10.329" style="s2">broth because the authority figure is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.160" end="00:16:12.040" style="s2">not there tell you which attendee the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.329" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2"> opposite as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.040" end="00:16:17.259" style="s2">right now if you actually folsom you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.060" style="s2">eating your Brocket because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.259" end="00:16:21.069" style="s2">right thing to do and it&#39;s easy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.060" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">just a natural thing and so this builds</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.069" end="00:16:24.040" style="s2">up from the bottom it&#39;s basically just</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.990" style="s2">building it on a solid foundation and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.040" end="00:16:27.790" style="s2">you build it on the base and so okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.990" end="00:16:30.100" style="s2">gonna take responsibility and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.790" end="00:16:31.180" style="s2">gonna enter into a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.100" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">another human being where I&#39;m gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.180" end="00:16:34.629" style="s2">responsibility for the relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">and with human being who&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.629" end="00:16:37.689" style="s2">responsibility for Mike is herself and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">then we&#39;re gonna have a child together</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.689" end="00:16:40.870" style="s2">responsibly and we&#39;re gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:42.069" style="s2">responsibility for that child and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.870" end="00:16:43.180" style="s2">gonna start stepping out and taking more</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.069" end="00:16:44.740" style="s2">responsibility for the place where we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.180" end="00:16:47.170" style="s2">live and where the child&#39;s my perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.740" end="00:16:48.850" style="s2">going schooler is right humanity and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.170" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">not and not with a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.850" end="00:16:55.990" style="s2">powerlessness and therefore the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:57.730" style="s2">either like that lashing out edge of I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">actually I completely agree yeah vastly</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.820" end="00:17:43.240" style="s2">better that notion of being completely</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.240" end="00:17:46.419" style="s2">that context is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.620" end="00:17:49.570" style="s2">abysmal we&#39;ve now witnessed that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.419" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">seen that experiment that happened and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.570" end="00:17:51.940" style="s2">think you&#39;re right I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:58.210" style="s2">deep visceral sense I mean honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.940" end="00:17:59.650" style="s2">feel how did I say this right I feel a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.210" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">sense of like how can we actually help</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.650" end="00:18:04.600" style="s2">the baby boomers get across that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:06.760" style="s2">threshold like how do we know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.600" end="00:18:09.159" style="s2">got to be absolutely terrified by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.760" end="00:18:11.020" style="s2">recognition that the world that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.159" end="00:18:13.270" style="s2">they live in that they&#39;ve helped build</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.020" end="00:18:15.549" style="s2">largely helped build is not one that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.270" end="00:18:20.380" style="s2">they want to be actually truly old and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.549" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">die in and yet you know it&#39;s not yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.380" end="00:18:24.549" style="s2">available we don&#39;t yet have the things</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.940" end="00:18:26.860" style="s2">in place to allow them to have a family</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.549" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">and a community that is rich and can</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.860" end="00:18:30.580" style="s2">meet human beings even as they move into</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:31.480" style="s2">elder hood and then death but that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.580" end="00:18:32.890" style="s2">clearly the thing that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.480" end="00:18:35.230" style="s2">and I think we could all perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.890" end="00:18:37.779" style="s2">all the way down to our you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.230" end="00:18:43.059" style="s2">depths of our bones yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.779" end="00:18:44.860" style="s2">pretty duck the the sort of the baby</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.059" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">boomer thing of oh they run around and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.860" end="00:18:48.429" style="s2">like had all the drugs and had all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.169" style="s2">sex and then we&#39;re like right no more of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.429" end="00:18:51.850" style="s2">that for anyone else and now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.169" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">take over every industry possible and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.850" end="00:18:55.149" style="s2">we&#39;re actually not gonna give up any of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:18:56.620" style="s2">our jobs ever and we&#39;re gonna stay here</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.149" end="00:18:59.529" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna live till we&#39;re like 100</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.620" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">others that the ending isn&#39;t so nice for</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.529" end="00:19:03.190" style="s2">them actually it&#39;s like a Scarface thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:04.899" style="s2">yeah people always forget the ending of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.190" end="00:19:09.159" style="s2">Scarface we&#39;re like you know his sisters</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.899" end="00:19:10.750" style="s2">like he gets she gets killed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.159" end="00:19:11.799" style="s2">his fault and he dies and stuff people</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.750" end="00:19:13.450" style="s2">just think about let the fun bit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.799" end="00:19:15.820" style="s2">Scarface that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.450" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">the ending of Scarface is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.820" end="00:19:20.860" style="s2">idea it&#39;s a moral lesson and the ending</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:22.840" style="s2">of the boom is the potential ending of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.860" end="00:19:25.480" style="s2">the boom as is this is the saddest is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:26.980" style="s2">the sadder standing there is it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.480" end="00:19:29.470" style="s2">interesting because it is actually just</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.980" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">down to a choice yes like as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.470" end="00:19:33.250" style="s2">and as a group they still have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:36.130" style="s2">capacity to change the story so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.250" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">the superpower is when you decide</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.130" end="00:19:40.299" style="s2">because yeah you did the optimism thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:43.149" style="s2">although the wholesomeness thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.299" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">just a decision and you decide it every</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.149" end="00:19:46.690" style="s2">day and you acts on it every day every</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:48.820" style="s2">day you go out and interact with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.690" end="00:19:51.520" style="s2">world you could glare at someone you</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.820" end="00:19:53.020" style="s2">could smile at them just the little</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:55.030" style="s2">small tiny things like that are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.020" end="00:19:58.090" style="s2">things that then ripple out and maneuver</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.030" end="00:19:58.450" style="s2">and you have to be mindful all times</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.090" end="00:19:59.860" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.450" end="00:20:01.990" style="s2">is very easy to get the trucks and</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.860" end="00:20:04.540" style="s2">distracted from that path yeah and fall</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.990" end="00:20:07.720" style="s2">into a rage or something pointless or -</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.540" end="00:20:10.780" style="s2">to be brought down by a potential dark</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.720" end="00:20:14.410" style="s2">possibility or whatever it is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.780" end="00:20:18.220" style="s2">a thing that requires much work and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.410" end="00:20:19.780" style="s2">purpose but purpose brings power without</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.220" end="00:20:21.160" style="s2">purpose you&#39;re powerless something and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.780" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">then it&#39;s depressing you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.160" end="00:20:24.310" style="s2">but if you have purpose that&#39;s powerful</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:25.750" style="s2">thing and if you go out and enact that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.310" end="00:20:28.500" style="s2">in the world and continue to do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.750" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">then it grows it grows exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.500" end="00:20:32.530" style="s2">right and everyone around you is doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">it as well there&#39;s a whole bunch of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.530" end="00:20:35.410" style="s2">doing it right howdy it&#39;s easier and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:38.830" style="s2">easier and more and more powerful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.410" end="00:20:40.230" style="s2">it has the the characteristic that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.830" end="00:20:42.780" style="s2">the technology world they call a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.230" end="00:20:45.250" style="s2">positive feedback loop or an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.780" end="00:20:47.380" style="s2">what&#39;s called a network effect and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.250" end="00:20:49.890" style="s2">happens in you first yeah you make if</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.380" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">you have to just make one choice and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.890" end="00:20:54.310" style="s2">then you can listen to the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.290" style="s2">of how that choice is better than the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.310" end="00:20:58.300" style="s2">other choice and then as the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.290" end="00:21:00.520" style="s2">that okay I&#39;ll make some more in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.300" end="00:21:02.710" style="s2">vein to feel like that and go in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.520" end="00:21:04.120" style="s2">direction then you get more clarity on</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.710" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">what that feels like to make those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.120" end="00:21:07.630" style="s2">of choices and you get more courage</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:09.730" style="s2">because if you have more hope that might</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.630" end="00:21:11.410" style="s2">actually lead to better and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.730" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">see things working and the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.410" end="00:21:15.010" style="s2">that works maybe this will work and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">that does work and then it becomes this</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.010" end="00:21:19.860" style="s2">this practical real-world thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:21.940" style="s2">like I was saying earlier about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.860" end="00:21:25.150" style="s2">minecraft generation just knowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.940" end="00:21:27.130" style="s2">certain things work you know the the</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:35.580" style="s2">experience of disappointment in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.520" end="00:23:37.410" style="s2">storytellers failing to deliver on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.580" end="00:23:38.610" style="s2">promise and by the way the obligation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.410" end="00:23:40.620" style="s2">being the ones who actually create the</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.460" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">that the in the in the telling of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:52.950" style="s2">Fantastic Four stories that have shown</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:54.090" style="s2">up in Hollywood thus far I felt sad and</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.090" end="00:23:57.750" style="s2">should have felt like why do I feel sad</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.750" end="00:24:01.860" style="s2">actually remember as a kid sitting down</p>

<p begin="00:25:53.180" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">earth father Park Kent who was just the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.640" end="00:26:01.070" style="s2"> just distillation of goodness</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:02.870" style="s2">and like you know the past however many</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.070" end="00:26:04.100" style="s2">years you couldn&#39;t tell that story cuz</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.140" end="00:26:24.410" style="s2">probably poor calls and the wrong kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:27.320" style="s2">of energy but this in some sense is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.410" end="00:26:29.660" style="s2">Jordan Pederson story right he is he</p>
