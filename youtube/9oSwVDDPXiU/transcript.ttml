<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">a massive</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.320" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">book list contained within uh the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis series</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">uh which i&#39;ve just finished the series</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s i know it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.600" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">challenging uh thing to engage in so</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.680" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">thank you for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">is there a recommended starting point</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">for exploring these</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve already ordered by harry</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">frankfurt</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">and aspiration by agnes callard due to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">personal interest in this topic</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">and i noticed that a few of the books</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">were either very highly praised such as</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:17.920" style="s2">the sovereignty of the good</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">by iris murdoch or mentioned repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.920" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">such as transformative experiences by</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">l.a paul</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">i do not have a background in western</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">philosophy so i&#39;m wondering if there</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">might be a sort of general</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">order to go in old to new new to old</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">easy to heart certain lineages</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">thank you so rachel first of all let me</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">give you um</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">an order that i would recommend going</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">through the books that you&#39;ve noted here</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">i would recommend starting with uh the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">sovereignty of the good</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">and then moving to frankfurt&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">then moving to l.a paul&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">transformative experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">and then moving to agnes keller&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">aspiration um and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">is because there&#39;s an important sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">some of the books directly presuppose uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">one another so aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">uh presupposes that you&#39;ve read the uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">transformative experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">i think transformative experience is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">very much helped if you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">sovereignty of the good</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">the sovereignty the good and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">also talk to each other in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">contrast</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">um so a general principle though that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">thought that i followed in the advice i</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">gave you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">is i went from old to new</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s generally a good idea when</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">moving through these books</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">um the easy to hard isn&#39;t as good a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">lineages are a little bit more more more</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">uh to work out but a general strategy is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">to move through it uh chronologically</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">because of the way in which uh later</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">and theories build on previous arguments</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">and theories</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">especially uh when i&#39;m using them within</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis um</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">so i would recommend uh pretty strongly</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">that you go</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">in historical order of the books that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">are found</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">in awakening for the meeting crisis um</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">you might want to limit it to certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">uh like genres or sub-genres</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">for example there you know you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">want to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">in a chronological order</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">uh within uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">what you might call a theological uh a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">or chronological uh chronological order</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">within psychological thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">uh things like that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">generally going chronologically is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">best you may be able to subdivide it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">into some subgenres</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">but that&#39;s usually the best strategy for</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">the way i&#39;m making use of the material</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">with an awakening from the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">okay so the next one is from steam</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">a regular patron good to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">tian i would like</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">uh to hear you speak on some</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">psychopathology in general and or</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">confusion and psychosis in particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">that might not be your field of study</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">but i&#39;m curious to hear uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">if not i have another question how is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">going with your chocolate addiction</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">so i my chocolate addiction</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">is going fairly well right now um</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">largely but not keeping very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">in my proximity uh seems to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">effective strategy</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">um so i think i will talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">more time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">your first question so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">coming out that i think is converging on</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">that you can see psychopathology as</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">lying on a continuum and it is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">continuum</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">basically in terms of salient regulation</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">or dysregulation which has ultimately do</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">with ways in which relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">uh can become pathological</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">because it has lost cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">so on so uh there&#39;s there&#39;s vatican</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">crispy</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the work of us and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">work of kapoor</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">i won&#39;t go into a particular the basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">idea is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">um that psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">is when the relevance realization of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">machinery</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">is hyperactive in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">that it is finding too many patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">are not there and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">grabbing too much information as</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">relevant in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">and realizing patterns that are not real</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">part of how this is probably happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:50.479" style="s2">is a decrease in the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">distinguish causal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.479" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">from correlational patterns this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">seems to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">within schizophrenia on the other end of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">would be people who might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:08.160" style="s2">not noticing enough patterns now this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">called the autistic end of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.160" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s a little bit problematic</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">uh because autism is itself a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">disorder</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">but the general idea here is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">family of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">disorders known as autism</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">and one of the features that they share</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">in common</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">is that people are not no they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">if the the psychotic person is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">too many patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">that are not there the autistic person</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">is not seeing enough of the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">that are actually there</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">so they are discounting too many of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">real they&#39;re discounting too many real</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">they&#39;re not finding salient enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">enough of the real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">and so what a lot of people are now</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">is strategies instead of trying to deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">the ideation the ideas that people have</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">strategies that deal with the affect how</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">are effectively aroused or their affect</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">is too intense or too</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">flat people are talking about how can we</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">help modify</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">uh and help people more properly</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">regulate</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">their their their salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">uh so that we can bring people up</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way right word uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">who are not noticing enough uh patterns</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">as relevant</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">and we can regulate down uh people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">are noticing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">too many patterns as relevant so</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">but one of the interesting things about</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">this for me we never wrote it down which</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">unfortunate but what i was originally</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">tim lillacroft and blake richards on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">original</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">uh relevance realization paper</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">in 2007 2008</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">i remember going on a walk with blake</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">and he actually proposed</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">that he thought that the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">realization theory that we were working</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">uh would would uh be the basis for a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">re-understanding uh psychopathology in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">much more coherent</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">and integrated fashion and i wish we had</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">made that an actual formal prediction</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">because it looks like it&#39;s coming to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">and so that would be my answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">question of what&#39;s the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">what do i see the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">ideas around relevant realization</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">and ideas about psychopathology</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">so the next question is from karima</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">who&#39;s a patron and who support</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">both in terms of financial support and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">the continual contributions</p>

<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">this came up on the discord sit today</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">with some of us needing more definition</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">physical sensations and identified</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">emotions held in the body are more</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">easily entertained for examination than</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">our thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">yes so just quickly what are the five</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">factors of inquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">uh the first factor of inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">mindfulness is vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">this is the capacity that gets us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">move away from the familiar</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">um superficial aspects of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">and gets us to try and probe to what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">unfamiliar uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">more profound aspects of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">sensitivity this is the factor that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">tries to set</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">us set our experience back in motion</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">uh an analogy i use is letting your</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">experience unfold as a movie rather than</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">being satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">with snapshots that you take of it with</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">uh with your mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">acuity acuity is to pull apart the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">uh layers and components of an</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">that&#39;s when you&#39;re for example when</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing pain</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">um you can pull apart sort of the felt</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">nastiness the tension</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">the emotional reaction the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">and and then there is noticing</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">noticing is to pay attention to three</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">sort of uh orientation centers</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">how is your body responding to this how</p>

<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">mind doing again not so much not what</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">but is your mind speeding up slowing</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">points out</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">um applying the five the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">inquiring mindfulness to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">is particularly hard um because</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">finding that space between being aware</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">of it and being</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">aware within it is very hard so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s relatively easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not super easy but it&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">easy when i&#39;m in pain</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">notice in pain that i part of me can</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">sort of step back and not be in the pain</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">and look at it it&#39;s much harder to try</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">step back and look at a thought without</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">being within the thinking process</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">typically what happens and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.839" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">for a long time for novices</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">is when you step back and try to look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">you either do one of two things you fall</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">back into the thoughts you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">thinking and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">wrapped up in the content of your</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">thoughts and then you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost uh mindfulness or you stay</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:34.320" style="s2">disconnected from the thinking process</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">and it just sort of disappears away into</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.320" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">okay so one of the things you can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">right is and i did mention this uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">when we talked about this so um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">hoping i&#39;m not just being repetitive i</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">hope i can</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">bring it out in it in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">that&#39;s adjusted to the novelty of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">situation for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">um so one of the things that works</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">one of the tricks of the trade is to try</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">and pay attention to the voice</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">so when i&#39;m applying the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">acquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">what&#39;s unfamiliar to me typically</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">so i&#39;m applying vigilance is i try to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">not to concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">what my thinking is let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">just with sort of inner sentences uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">because uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">um i i can&#39;t do a complete lesson here</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">right so i do the vigilance because i</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">step back</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">and what i normally do is i look at what</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">the content of my thought is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">but in vigilance i try to get below i</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">try to get below that familiar surface</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">i try to get at the voice of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">and the identity bound up with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">is is it my voice um what age</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">is the voice what like is it a whiny</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">is it uh a thrashing voice so</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">i pretend as if i like as if i was on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">a bus and there was somebody sitting</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">beside me and i wasn&#39;t looking at them</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">but i</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">they&#39;re speaking a language i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">and so i&#39;m trying to pick up on their</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">and then i&#39;m trying to pick up on their</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">age of their voice perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">the gender of the voice uh the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">state of the voice</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">and trying to and i try to be right</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">sensitivity to that well i i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">how that is unfolding is it unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">is it unfolding slowly um is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">are there pauses or gaps in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">the uh so so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s i&#39;ve done the vigilance i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">the sensitivity uh the acuity</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">right you but notice i already got some</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">of the acuity going</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">i try to notice different components of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">this like i said i try to notice</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">um the aspects of the voice that has to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">you know is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">voice my voice is it someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">is it a voice from me now is it a voice</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">from someone else now</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">from someone else some other time um</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">are there is there one voice is there</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">multiple voice and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it it is tricky to to do these</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">just in sequence because</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">i go but if i was to try and put it into</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">sequence i shift to looking at the voice</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">i let the voice unfold i pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">to tempo texture</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">i then pull apart these aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:33.199" style="s2">right and then i try to notice how</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">my body my heart and my mind are</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.199" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">responding</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">to that that voice how it&#39;s flowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">and the different parts that i&#39;ve pulled</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">apart with acuity</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">and of course i didn&#39;t do the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">factor uh when i was talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">five factors earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">the fifth factor is reminding which is i</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">try to stay within mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">i try to stay in inquiry through moving</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">observation through soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">rather than inquiry through the posing</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">of questions the uh the offering of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">inferential justification</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">explanation uh etc</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">so i hope that was helpful um that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">very tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">um and it takes a quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">what i can report is that when this gels</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">they often find it a very transformative</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">experience they often find it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">very transformative to realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">voice in their head</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">sometimes isn&#39;t theirs and i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">anything psychotic about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">or even if it&#39;s theirs it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">them as an adult it&#39;s them as a 10 year</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">old or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">so try that and see if that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">rob uh so rob is a great patron great</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">supporter i always enjoy spending</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">uh time with rob so rob writes i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed people sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">self-center the words like have</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">is it extreme to frequently reframe the</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">it is appropriate to be in the having</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">mode is more appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">one of the things i do to try and</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">use uh more being mode expressions and</p>

<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">but notice what i said that isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">across the board</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">trying to replace having mode with being</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s actually a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">of from and a misunderstanding of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve been using from</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">the point is not that the hamming mode</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">is bad or the being mode is good</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">um or that you should at all times in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">all places in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">all ways try to always be in the being</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">mode that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">the mistake right the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">trying to correct</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">is modal confusion sometimes you should</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">in the in the having mode and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">having language is completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">appropriate sometimes you need</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">to be in the being mode and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:45.039" style="s2">you can help to structure that by using</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.039" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">that is more directly appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">the being mode so</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">be sorry</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">i hope this doesn&#39;t sound hack made</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">or cliche it&#39;s important to be wise in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s important not it&#39;s important right</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">be flexibly responsive with the</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">eye to the situation you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">the mode that is appropriate and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">language that is appropriate to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">for me this is part of well you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">promise i make</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">uh when i&#39;m doing the five promises you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">know in reverence and respect</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">for the power and promise of speech i</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">promise</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">not to speak foolishly or falsely but to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">speak wisely in the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">so noting how much speech and humanity</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">are woven together i always try to use</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">my language</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">wisely but wisely doesn&#39;t mean in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">a formulaic fashion it means with</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">reflexible discernment</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">like i just said so i think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">important um</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">to uh to try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">meet that promise you know my it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">the traditional training precepts but</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s important to not meet it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">formulaically but meet it with finesse</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">uh so now a question from alex</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">siminov who&#39;s part of the discord sanger</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">uh welcome alexi it&#39;s always great to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">have you</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">here so this is a fair long question i</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">will try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">go through it i hope at a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">pace so people can follow along</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">after i did a long contemplation of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">is important in my life a few years back</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">i realized that two things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">of crucial importance self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">through work</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">and family i suspect that most people</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">put these two</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">on top as well sometimes in different</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">order yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">but i found it impossible to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">consistent progress on both at the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">so for a few years i had to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">family part and go 100</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:01.679" style="s2">optimizing for self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">through work</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.679" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">i believe this is the right way for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">man to approach this prioritization</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">problem when time</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">attention and resources are not enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">to attack both problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">that bears fruit but it is very it is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">very lopsided way of living that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">ultimately counterproductive what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">be a wise philosophical way to approach</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">this challenge</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">in your experience ps</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">i really like when you show applications</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">of ancient philosophy practices to solve</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">problems like above i can&#39;t quite see</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">all of the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">i do not like some of the latest</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">uh let me see if i can move this a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">little tiny bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">i uh i do not like some of the latest</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">here it is uh discussions would seem to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">towards more theoretical dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">of philosophy yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">so some of that yeah so uh i&#39;ll last</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">that the ps</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">thing first yeah so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">it&#39;s always trying to toggle between and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">between those two concerns um allowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">um a discussion in which the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">is articulating</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">um the terms bringing clarification uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">you know making sure that when things</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">are not confused or we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">equivocating</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">um introducing new conceptual vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">and theoretical grammar</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s also responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">interlocutor uh because where</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">they are particularly put pitched on</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">where they are trying to modulate their</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">cognition and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">in order to try and get a better optimal</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">grip</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">um on situations um</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">so i understand that what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">it is a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">um also to always try and bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">that philosophical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">back into transforming how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">at work in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">and i just want to say how important</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">this is alexis point</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">you need to be doing both um and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">need to be doing them both in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">coordinated manner and that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">greeks actually had two words for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">they had sophia and francis</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">and aristotle particularly talks about</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like the question um of how do i</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">decide between justice and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">so sophia can work out</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">tradeoffs you can do all that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">very very different</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">the phronesis of but what do i do here</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">because the point of the prodigal son is</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">very clear about the principles</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">and then you need to do a lot of work in</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">understand the point you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">right wonder seems like an organic mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">state and can&#39;t really be contrived in</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">can it it can um</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">but i underst but i understand the point</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">to what i think you prescribe here is in</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">uh see bring me the rhinoceros or madame</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">dialogues but those require a foundation</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">of understanding shunyata my question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">is having a temporary mindset of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:52.320" style="s2">enough of a boost to move one who is</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">stuck in looping conceptualizations to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">develop more</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">meta awareness or prajna uh ps saw</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.279" style="s2">evidence that folk also think wonder</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:00.799" style="s2">means regression to childhood</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.279" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">yeah that last one that wonder means</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.799" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">regression to childhood that&#39;s an in</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">that that&#39;s due to decadent romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">um yeah and uh um</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s you know the the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">wonder is something like what we have in</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">childhood woodsworth is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">sort of a classic example of that and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">that needs to be seriously challenged uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">like socrates said that wisdom begins in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">wonder</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">and you you mentioned cohen practice and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">madame dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">things like that i think um and they um</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">and that they require the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">of shunyata</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">um i think that um socratic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">uh also uh has the same thing uh because</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">of especially for its capacity to bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">people into</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">a state of emporia um so i think simply</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">asking i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">i agree with you people uh if they</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">haven&#39;t practiced</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">even if they have a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">distinction i think of just sophia not</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">for lisa</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">even if they have a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">distinction between wonder curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">if they haven&#39;t practiced right if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">have to practice in phronesis the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">they&#39;re just going to fall into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">conflation at a procedural level of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">as you indicated they&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">fall into</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">critique and right and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">so i think what&#39;s needed uh and this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">start of the work</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">a lot of the work that i&#39;m doing with</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">christopher master pietro and also with</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">guys henstock and jordan hall peter</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">lindberg and other people are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">there&#39;s all these things emerging</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">around the process that i call dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">i mean by that is that a practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">of questioning but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">drawing people out amplifying them</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">getting them to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a uh it&#39;s an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">that then fits into a higher order</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">and what it&#39;s designed to do is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">provoke</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">wonder it&#39;s designed to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">uh call into question</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">through a perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">how they&#39;re seeing things and how they</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">are showing up how they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">and how they are being in a coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s why almost all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">socratic dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">centered on topics around virtue because</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">when people</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">start to reflect on virtue they they</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">typically will bring in</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">uh they&#39;ll tend to bring in more</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">uh knowing and so i do think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">um this is something i take very</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">seriously i think there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">of getting people oriented that way</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">that&#39;s one part of it and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">ways of getting people into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">state within distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">and the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">is a cascade of insights and if you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">people in a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">with indestructible cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:59.240" style="s2">they&#39;re doing socratic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">they will you&#39;ll tend to get a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.240" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">self-organization an emergence of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">that starts to happen where people first</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">start wondering but what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">they wonder about other people but then</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">they start wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">right the very process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">intelligibility the very the with</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">the way things are unfolding for them</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">i think when you get that kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">socratic wonder</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">that can be a powerful way of shifting</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">people in the way you&#39;re asking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">um but i think that requires a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">pedagogical program</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">of practices to get people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">on a powerful basis i think simply</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">using the sentence string i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">um would be inadequate i think even</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">having just a deliberate intent i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">going to wonder instead of being curious</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">is insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">you have to engage of course you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">be doing that you should be doing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">sofia</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">you should be doing the theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">reflection but you need the phronesis</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">practice if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">actually engage in wonder as something</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">distinct from curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">and engage in it at a level that&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">enough to engage perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">right in something like a flow state so</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">that deeper transformation</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">is actually possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">okay so now we&#39;re going to get some</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">further questions uh this</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">is from zazian das chenov a patron</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">what are your views on emotions mental</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">states and mental disorders as dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">computational processes guiding</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">rr and the self-organizing system of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">mind and body uh first</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the first part of the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">second do you think there are analogous</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">processes on the level</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">of society or civilization as a whole so</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">first words</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">emotions um i&#39;ve already spoken about</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">mental disorders</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">uh when i answered stean&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">mental states that&#39;s an ambiguous term</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">if it means</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">consciousness um i&#39;ll have to put that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">aside</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">so not quite put it aside that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">the right way what i was thinking what i</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">meant what i was</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">putting it aside in my mind because i</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">was putting it into</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">a sort of category of uh a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">i think about mental states if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">understand them</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">as states of consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">basically perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">perspectival knowing and how it works in</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">terms of salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s how it overlaps with the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve said about</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">mental pathologies and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">salient landscaping will also map onto</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">what i want to talk about with emotions</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">so following on some sort of seminal</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">work uh by</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">uh by ronnie d&#39;souza and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">and also especially by keith odly</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">and then following up on um</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">work by reed montague and others</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">i want to say that emotions are a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">particular way in which we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">to be angry is to uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">be like to be here now</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">to be you know in this state of mind</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">here now</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:23.359" style="s2">uh salience landscaping in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.359" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">and that makes sense because the process</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">of relevance realization is not called</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">calculation</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">uh re this is what i mentioned read</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">montague the difference between you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">a computer</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">is you care about the information you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">why do you care well first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">can&#39;t process it all</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">neither can a computer but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter to the computer</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t process it all and you care</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">about information because you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">to find the information that will help</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">care for yourself because you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">autopoetic thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">yourself because you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">engaged in the project</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">of making yourself making yourself at</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">many levels making yourself as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">identity yourself making yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">as a mind making yourself as a living</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">so emotions are ways in which that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">affect that character look when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">doing relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">i&#39;m spending my very precious and very</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">limited time and resources</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">cognitive and conscious processing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">i&#39;m spending it on trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">what will matter to me most sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">literally matter to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">like what&#39;s important to me take into me</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">what will</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">literally help me keep making</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">myself biologically</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">cognitively consciously and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">existentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">and so emotions are the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">relevance realization the caring that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">an integral part of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">realization comes</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">into working memory as a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">of salience landscaping that then</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">helps me find those affordances given to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">me by participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">that i can make it it makes obvious the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">affordances</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">that should be happening here notice how</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">emotions come</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">with come with this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">amplification of what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">obvious and what is obvious to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">and what is available to you right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">and what the opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">action is so that&#39;s what i think um</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what i think um</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">all uh i could say right now not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">not all that can be said</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">i hope it didn&#39;t sound like it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">saying that that&#39;s all i can say right</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">about the interconnections in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">and related ideas about perspectival and</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">you can see how we can talk about in an</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">emotions mental states</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">uh one of the besetting sins of</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">can get something that looks very</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">much uh like stubbornness</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">very much like a an awakening to it</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">way david is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">um and for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">um i i tend to be by</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.520" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">constitution and because of my own sort</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">and character flaws um i tend to be</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">because the language</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">that people use about this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">language of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">and and you know and i had a really</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">level of phronesis how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.960" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">take th that ephemeral coherence</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">and how do we make it more long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">not in the sense that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">always blissed out but how do these</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:57.040" style="s2">ephemeral coherences</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">uh plug into a cultural disposition</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.040" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">of of awakening in that way</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">so the fact that that&#39;s now becoming a</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">and so i do think it is still a race i</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">do think it is not a foregone conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:33.359" style="s2">um but i find it deeply encouraging and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">so</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">so there&#39;s now a gems jmes</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">to what extent do we need narrative for</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">identity our relation to the world and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:11.119" style="s2">if the deal logos is the way forward man</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">is this a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.119" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">i&#39;m wrestling with right now it was it</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">was that was a question that was at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">of the excellent we all agreed it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">excellent tia logos</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:23.920" style="s2">between paul vander clay jonathan pajot</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">and myself and then i did a follow-up uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.920" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">with jordan hall that was also</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">excellent on dlo goes deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">narrative the point i was making there</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">is um that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">deal logos is deeper than narrative uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">narrative comes later in development it</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">has to be extensively trained</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">deliberately practiced whereas dialogos</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">naturally to human beings and it comes</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">children are into the logos even before</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:54.640" style="s2">right they&#39;re sort of full-fledged</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">cognitive agents i mean you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">the work of tomasello and all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:47:59.760" style="s2">that&#39;s going on now</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">even around language acquisition uh and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">think about what would happen if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">took dialogue dialogue at least even</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:05.839" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">out of narrative if narrative would like</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.839" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">collapse and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">also internal dialogue narrative would</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">collapse to something</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">much more like uh chronology it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">be the same but it would</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">it would lose a lot of what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">distinct from near chronology</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">so i think the logos is deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">and then i&#39;m i&#39;m teaching a course right</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">now on uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">on the uh on the elusive self the nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">and function of the self</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">and uh this question about how much</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">we definitely need narrative to train</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">uh identity to make it temporally</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">extended so that i can identify</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">with the non-logical version so i can</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">engage in non-logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">with myself as a five-year-old or with</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">myself as an 80 year old</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s important for moral</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">responsibility and long-term planning</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">and adaptivity so narrative seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">central to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">but we shouldn&#39;t confuse the language of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">training with the language of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">the fact that narrative helps me to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">train</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:08.800" style="s2">identity doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">it is necessarily constitutive of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.800" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">identity galen strassen in a very famous</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">and he&#39;s done some important work on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">nature of the self</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">argues that he doesn&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">himself in a narrative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">and he&#39;s of course a profound</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">philosopher he&#39;s a moral agent</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">of course he does experience himself</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">dialogically</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">because he writes these articles</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">somewhat monologically but he&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">go enters into dialogue uh with other</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">uh there&#39;s lots of people in for</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">e-cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">who are talking uh about identity</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">being much more an embodied embedded</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">enacted thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">um that is that is occurring</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">before we have full-blown propositional</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">representation in language</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">um so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">narrat and then and then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">other end so i&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">how it proceeds and grounds and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">the the post narrative the mystics</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">consistently telling us</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">we transcend beyond narrative we get to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">uh beyond narrative or you get as i</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">you get you know a figure like jesus of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.839" style="s2">nazareth who</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">and also tremendous also examples from</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.839" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">the sufi tradition</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.319" style="s2">of people using narrative to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">self-destruct narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.319" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">to fling people beyond narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">into a post-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">uh mental state because narrative works</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:44.000" style="s2">in terms of us</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">of stable roles a problem resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">etc um and the whole point again of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">prodigal son is</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">there is no such resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">you&#39;re put back into a dialogical mode</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">that is post-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">because the dialogue is a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">the the the the the the tension points</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">with the tone us i&#39;m constantly i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">constantly dialogically moving in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">post-narrative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">between justice and compassion between</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:14.480" style="s2">individuation</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">and participation so i think we should</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.480" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">think of just</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">i think we should think sorry of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">something that is indispensable at</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">a stage in development kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">you know i&#39;m thinking of piercing stage</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">but that if we lock</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">into that as the final word on</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">we are actually cutting ourselves off</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">from the deepest machinery by which</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">identity is formed and how that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">machinery can propel us beyond</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">a narrative identity an egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">right to what has been some called sign</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">sometimes called the non-self</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">the true self right the self beyond</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">um etc and where people</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">claim to find a fullness of being</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">the next question is from tracy oh i get</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">can be very powerful also the active</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">practices that help you learn how to</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">but because they&#39;re powerful they</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">adaptive they are also powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">biasing</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">and they can be powerful sources of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">and so also learning how to recognize</p>
