<p begin="00:00:06.420" end="00:00:10.530" style="s2">about existential risks and how to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:12.330" style="s2">them we&#39;ve already done several other</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">episodes with Danielle before and they</p>

<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">mind-expanding and inspirational but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:20.580" style="s2">think this one is particularly important</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:22.410" style="s2">because he talks about some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">pressing issues that we face on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.410" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">planet today and proposes some ways that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">we can solve them if you want to check</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">so today we&#39;re talking about existential</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.240" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">risks which is a topic I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">quite familiar with that you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">brought up in past episodes with us so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:24.150" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve actually really</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">been looking forward to getting into</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.150" end="00:02:29.340" style="s2">with you great so why don&#39;t we start</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">with the big questions what are some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.340" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">the biggest existential risks that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:34.470" style="s2">are facing on the planet right now so</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">for those who aren&#39;t familiar the term</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">existential risk means some risk that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">could stop us from existing so a species</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">threatening event there&#39;s also plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">catastrophic risks that would just</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:45.570" style="s2">really suck even though we wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">completely wiped out as a species so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.570" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">their versions of World War three that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">are existential kinds of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">holocaust that nobody makes it through</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">there are kinds of World War three that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">are catastrophic meaning some group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">people in remote areas make it through</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">but the atmosphere holds you rhenium and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:04.019" style="s2">you know most of the people did very</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">poorly so we&#39;re kind of interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.019" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">preventing all of those things right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">what are the categories first there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:13.110" style="s2">different ways of kind of chunking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:15.000" style="s2">different ways of doing taxonomy one</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.110" end="00:03:18.090" style="s2">thing we can look at is start by saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.000" end="00:03:19.230" style="s2">there are kind of human-induced things</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.090" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">and then there&#39;s kind of natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.230" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">phenomena the natural phenomena are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">things that either</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:26.850" style="s2">arise from within our Earth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:28.350" style="s2">biosphere or outside of it so outside of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">it is things like solar flares and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.350" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">Carrington events asteroids that can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:34.290" style="s2">catastrophic or existential and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.269" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.290" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">you know within our atmosphere most of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.269" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">the natural phenomena that would occur</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:43.109" style="s2">would not be existential but there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:46.019" style="s2">some super caldera kinds of scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.109" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">that would be we&#39;re obviously interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.019" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">in any of them because you know if if</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">there was an event that we just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">avoid here then Mars colony moves up on</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">the priority list right mm-hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:03:58.950" style="s2">surprisingly most of these things if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2">have more Intel about them many of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.950" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">can be avoided or at least mitigated</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">against so for instance if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.370" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">something like a Carrington event we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">looking at solar flares or coronal mass</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:15.139" style="s2">ejections that besides the just effect</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">that they would have on biology directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.139" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">would also have effects on electrical</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">circuitry as far as biology goes there</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">might be a impact on one part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">planet people can go underground it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.380" style="s2">not that big a deal but as far as frying</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:29.970" style="s2">the circuitry goes if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.380" end="00:04:32.009" style="s2">about frying the circuitry of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.970" end="00:04:33.479" style="s2">cooling stations on the power plant so</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.009" end="00:04:35.789" style="s2">then they turn into nuclear volcanoes</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.479" end="00:04:38.430" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty big deal now we could of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.789" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">course do things to mitigate against the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.430" end="00:04:43.020" style="s2">sensitivity there like hardening the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">nuclear cooling stations and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.020" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2">other forms of key infrastructure so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:50.190" style="s2">even with regard to things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:51.599" style="s2">call natural phenomena obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:52.620" style="s2">know there are projects that are looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.599" end="00:04:55.380" style="s2">at asteroids and other near-earth</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.620" end="00:04:57.449" style="s2">objects because depending upon what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.380" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">see they might actually be movable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.449" end="00:05:01.139" style="s2">there are a number of projects focused</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:03.240" style="s2">on that then we move our attention to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.139" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">you know human induced things and we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.240" end="00:05:08.520" style="s2">look at the ones that go through</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:10.820" style="s2">environmental pathways basically we</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.520" end="00:05:13.470" style="s2">either through biodiversity loss or</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.820" end="00:05:15.180" style="s2">climate change ocean acidification or</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.470" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">other kinds of effects on our biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.180" end="00:05:18.780" style="s2">we create a biosphere that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">uninhabitable to humans but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.780" end="00:05:24.330" style="s2">even have to get to full uninhabitable</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:26.669" style="s2">&#39;ti for partial uninhabitable &#39;ti to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.330" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">lead to the beginning of cascade effects</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.669" end="00:05:32.370" style="s2">you know when we look at what happened</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:33.810" style="s2">in Syria we see did a major part of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.370" end="00:05:36.150" style="s2">happened in factoring there were many</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:37.889" style="s2">many factors simultaneously but one part</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.150" end="00:05:41.009" style="s2">of it was droughts in an area that had</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.889" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">not had droughts led to subsistence</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.460" end="00:10:06.930" style="s2">then they just all fail scenarios right</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.700" end="00:10:09.210" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know how to prioritize</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.230" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">let&#39;s take that step within capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.030" end="00:10:31.630" style="s2">where we&#39;re playing a competitive game</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:33.970" style="s2">we&#39;re playing a win-lose game usually</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.010" end="00:11:15.880" style="s2">getting towards the tipping point of</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.270" end="00:12:02.440" style="s2">increasing the quality of our choice now</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.270" end="00:12:05.220" style="s2">when you multiply these together</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.440" end="00:12:09.370" style="s2">actually decreased information coherency</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.370" end="00:12:13.390" style="s2">terminating scenario right so what are</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.500" end="00:12:15.580" style="s2">some of the ways of avoiding that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.390" end="00:12:18.730" style="s2">especially I liked what you said about</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.580" end="00:12:21.520" style="s2">our loss of sense making and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.730" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">exponential curve of that also it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.520" end="00:12:25.090" style="s2">really interesting factor that I think a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:27.130" style="s2">lot of people aren&#39;t talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.090" end="00:12:28.960" style="s2">relates to one of the questions I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.130" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">going to ask what do we do about</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.960" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">the sort of institutionalized ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:36.820" style="s2">of people to what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:39.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s you mentioned the corporate</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.820" end="00:12:42.550" style="s2">interests and producing disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.520" end="00:12:45.010" style="s2">but there&#39;s also you know bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.550" end="00:12:47.740" style="s2">educational systems that are outdated or</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.010" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">motivated by different factors that have</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.740" end="00:12:51.399" style="s2">nothing to do with actually giving</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">people good information and then there</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.399" end="00:12:55.959" style="s2">is research that serves corporate needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:57.940" style="s2">and then there&#39;s media propaganda and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.959" end="00:13:00.790" style="s2">politics and all the stuff so what kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.940" end="00:13:03.070" style="s2">of tools do we actually have to change</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.790" end="00:13:05.050" style="s2">these systems in a way that they serve</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.070" end="00:13:07.630" style="s2">the planet rather than serving these</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.050" end="00:13:09.100" style="s2">individual interests we could say well</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.630" end="00:13:10.750" style="s2">when you talk about sense making</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.100" end="00:13:12.760" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t that be science shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.750" end="00:13:14.860" style="s2">science be sense making in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.760" end="00:13:16.899" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t journalism be sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.860" end="00:13:18.550" style="s2">making ray aren&#39;t these shouldn&#39;t the</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.550" end="00:13:23.830" style="s2">sense-making you know we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">scenarios where a scientist publishes a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.830" end="00:13:28.060" style="s2">scientific paper in a prestigious</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:33.730" style="s2">made it up the technical sounding words</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.510" end="00:13:36.339" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually gibberish and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.730" end="00:13:37.510" style="s2">through the publication process because</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.339" end="00:13:39.220" style="s2">they came from the right university or</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.220" end="00:13:44.950" style="s2">to show that the peer review process is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.080" end="00:13:48.310" style="s2">broken we&#39;ve also seen where you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.950" end="00:13:50.589" style="s2">stats like 50% of the articles posted in</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.970" end="00:14:16.750" style="s2">within science if you want to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.010" end="00:14:18.310" style="s2">about what the heart of science is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.750" end="00:14:20.440" style="s2">what the essence of the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.310" end="00:14:23.500" style="s2">Sciences the essence of it is earnest</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.440" end="00:14:26.589" style="s2">inquiry right like earnest desire to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.500" end="00:14:28.779" style="s2">understand the nature of reality and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.589" end="00:14:31.300" style="s2">whatever the speed of sound actually is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.779" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t care if it is different than I</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.300" end="00:14:34.810" style="s2">think it is I want to find out there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:37.060" style="s2">certain reverence for reality and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.810" end="00:14:38.650" style="s2">respect for the nature of what is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:40.660" style="s2">my own ideas about it or how I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.650" end="00:14:42.100" style="s2">benefit from it that is at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.660" end="00:14:45.759" style="s2">the scientific impulse</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.100" end="00:14:48.339" style="s2">but the scientists that need paid and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.759" end="00:14:51.220" style="s2">the equipment has to come from somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.339" end="00:14:53.769" style="s2">and if there are some of the answers</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.220" end="00:14:55.420" style="s2">that are more profitable than other</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.769" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">answers then it&#39;s easier to put money</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.420" end="00:14:58.899" style="s2">into it because I&#39;ll be able to get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.490" style="s2">money back and if an herb or a plant has</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.899" end="00:15:02.680" style="s2">some medicinal property but I will never</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.490" end="00:15:04.930" style="s2">be able to patent it and I won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.680" end="00:15:07.149" style="s2">to recoup the money that I get from you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.930" end="00:15:08.709" style="s2">know the small margins that I would put</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.149" end="00:15:10.839" style="s2">into the research how can we afford to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.709" end="00:15:12.279" style="s2">pay for it but we will with say</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.839" end="00:15:15.490" style="s2">something synthetic thing I can get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.279" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">patent on and etc right so what actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.490" end="00:15:19.990" style="s2">gets researched within that structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:22.779" style="s2">and how it gets researched so you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.990" end="00:15:24.670" style="s2">you have to factor how deep those kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.779" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2">of perverse incentives end up trickling</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.670" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">through the whole thing so then you ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">a good question which is within a system</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:34.329" style="s2">within a fundamentally win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.730" style="s2">game-theoretic system how do you prevent</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.329" end="00:15:39.670" style="s2">these issues and be able to have real</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.730" end="00:15:42.850" style="s2">coherency when we are incented to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.670" end="00:15:44.380" style="s2">withhold information and even you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.850" end="00:15:46.089" style="s2">like you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see in soccer</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.380" end="00:15:47.649" style="s2">football whatever someone will fake left</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.089" end="00:15:49.089" style="s2">to try and get the other person to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.649" end="00:15:50.589" style="s2">left and then they&#39;ll actually go right</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.089" end="00:15:52.839" style="s2">right like that&#39;s disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.589" end="00:15:55.060" style="s2">intentional disinformation so that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.839" end="00:15:57.509" style="s2">can throw the opponent off so you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.060" end="00:16:00.550" style="s2">win this is not different in</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.509" end="00:16:02.230" style="s2">corporations or Nations right and Intel</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.550" end="00:16:04.360" style="s2">and counter Intel and an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.230" end="00:16:07.329" style="s2">dissing firm ation same thing but with</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.360" end="00:16:08.769" style="s2">global level consequence so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.329" end="00:16:12.850" style="s2">another good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.769" end="00:16:14.980" style="s2">think about early tribes as competitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.850" end="00:16:16.779" style="s2">teams almost like a sports team where</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.980" end="00:16:18.850" style="s2">they have to work really well together</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.779" end="00:16:20.769" style="s2">and be very coherent with each other to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.850" end="00:16:22.540" style="s2">be able to compete with other teams and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.769" end="00:16:25.029" style="s2">military conflicts when they occur and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.540" end="00:16:26.920" style="s2">compete with the other teams for scarce</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.029" end="00:16:29.560" style="s2">resources in the shared environment the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.920" end="00:16:30.939" style="s2">shared commons say they they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.560" end="00:16:32.259" style="s2">military right they&#39;re just doing their</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.939" end="00:16:34.389" style="s2">own thing there&#39;s plenty of abundance</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.259" end="00:16:36.519" style="s2">but then if any of them realize that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.389" end="00:16:38.110" style="s2">they can do this military thing go kill</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.519" end="00:16:40.329" style="s2">another tribe take their stuff and get</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.110" end="00:16:41.589" style="s2">the riverfront that they had or get</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.329" end="00:16:43.329" style="s2">whatever kinds of things they had</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.589" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">acquired and developed that actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.329" end="00:16:47.800" style="s2">worked for them work better now everyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:49.480" style="s2">else has to build defensive militaries</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.800" end="00:16:51.880" style="s2">at least otherwise they lose by default</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.480" end="00:16:54.250" style="s2">and so one of the things to get in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.880" end="00:16:55.300" style="s2">history of win lose game theory is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.250" end="00:16:57.730" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.300" end="00:16:59.560" style="s2">it worked you could actually go kill the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.730" end="00:17:01.690" style="s2">other people take their stuff and make</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.560" end="00:17:04.540" style="s2">stuff better for you and you know your</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.690" end="00:17:06.280" style="s2">people and - if you didn&#39;t play win lose</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.540" end="00:17:08.829" style="s2">game theory and someone else did you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:10.929" style="s2">lost by default right which is why most</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.829" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">of the more peaceable less militaristic</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.929" end="00:17:15.880" style="s2">cultures got wiped out so then we say</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:17.290" style="s2">you know one of the tribes is just</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.880" end="00:17:18.309" style="s2">bigger and stronger than us we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.290" end="00:17:20.050" style="s2">going to be able to compete with them</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.309" end="00:17:22.360" style="s2">but if two or three of us smaller tribes</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.050" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">band together we can but then of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.360" end="00:17:25.089" style="s2">the other side has to compete so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:26.920" style="s2">band together and so now we move from</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.089" end="00:17:28.900" style="s2">tribes to villages right and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.920" end="00:17:30.760" style="s2">move up to kingdoms and to nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.900" end="00:17:32.980" style="s2">and to global economic trading bloc&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.760" end="00:17:35.559" style="s2">mean think about those evolutions of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.980" end="00:17:38.170" style="s2">what we think of as like civilization</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.559" end="00:17:40.270" style="s2">structures as evolutions of competitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.170" end="00:17:42.820" style="s2">teams within a win-lose game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.270" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">structure that have more and more power</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.910" end="00:18:04.900" style="s2">where all of the teams are stepping up</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.590" end="00:18:14.919" style="s2">that you have exponential technological</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.440" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">winning pretty much means losing because</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.300" end="00:19:23.380" style="s2">that makes money when that happens where</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.740" end="00:19:43.270" style="s2">at the same time of course not right</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.080" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">like that&#39;s supplied and demand 101 that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.270" end="00:19:47.770" style="s2">if there is a massive capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.770" end="00:19:50.740" style="s2">then you think about where those</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.060" end="00:19:52.930" style="s2">perverse incentives go everywhere right</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.740" end="00:19:55.630" style="s2">health care where if people weren&#39;t sick</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.930" end="00:19:58.330" style="s2">then the system loses all of its</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.630" end="00:20:01.390" style="s2">resource and so how could it ever really</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.330" end="00:20:03.640" style="s2">invest in prevention deeply when its</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.390" end="00:20:04.990" style="s2">profitability depends upon symptom</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.990" end="00:20:09.970" style="s2">quickly that&#39;s not profitable but if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.900" end="00:20:12.340" style="s2">manage symptoms ongoingly its profitable</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.970" end="00:20:13.900" style="s2">and if the symptom management causes</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.340" end="00:20:16.360" style="s2">other issues that need more symptom</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.900" end="00:20:18.490" style="s2">management ie more meds that&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.360" end="00:20:20.500" style="s2">an upsell or cross-sell maximizing the</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:29.110" style="s2">theory within that kind of incentive</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.920" end="00:20:32.560" style="s2">structure where we can&#39;t win at the wars</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.110" end="00:20:35.020" style="s2">anymore and yet we&#39;re moving closer to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.560" end="00:20:37.990" style="s2">the kinds of tensions where war becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.020" end="00:20:40.060" style="s2">more and more probable and we also can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.990" end="00:20:41.860" style="s2">win at competing for extracting the</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.480" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">almost at the biospheres limits right</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.040" end="00:20:49.930" style="s2">we&#39;re almost at the limits of what can</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:53.710" style="s2">be handled in the extraction of oil or</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.930" end="00:20:56.950" style="s2">fish or grazing land for cattle or so</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.710" end="00:20:59.170" style="s2">many things and so either we continue</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.950" end="00:21:03.010" style="s2">with win lose game theory and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.170" end="00:21:04.360" style="s2">Omni lose-lose catastrophic ly or we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.010" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">have to figure out how to have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.360" end="00:21:09.640" style="s2">power not turned against the other power</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">and figure out what does Omni win-win</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.640" end="00:21:14.230" style="s2">mean where no one has incentives that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:16.150" style="s2">are misaligned with the well-being of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.230" end="00:21:18.820" style="s2">others in that system that has that much</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.150" end="00:21:20.560" style="s2">power and that&#39;s really the fork in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.820" end="00:21:22.340" style="s2">road we&#39;re at as a species for the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.560" end="00:21:24.140" style="s2">time ever now is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.340" end="00:21:26.929" style="s2">either figure out what on me win-win</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.140" end="00:21:29.029" style="s2">means economically as a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.929" end="00:21:31.640" style="s2">governance wise we either figure out</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.029" end="00:21:33.350" style="s2">what that means or we continue with</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.640" end="00:21:35.510" style="s2">win-lose and it becomes olney lose-lose</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.350" end="00:21:37.700" style="s2">which pretty much means we either step</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.510" end="00:21:39.500" style="s2">up into a radically higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.700" end="00:21:42.230" style="s2">quality of life existence but the new</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.230" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">have a catastrophic step down</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.669" end="00:21:49.580" style="s2">existential or near existential but like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">in the next not very long time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.580" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">really the fork in the road and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.510" style="s2">evidence do you see of us going down one</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.470" end="00:22:00.169" style="s2">path or the other with more preference</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.510" end="00:22:02.809" style="s2">if we just plot curves it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.169" end="00:22:05.330" style="s2">good right if we just plot the curves of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.809" end="00:22:07.640" style="s2">what has happened so far with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.330" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">how much harm came from new power that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.640" end="00:22:12.230" style="s2">we developed and we look at how fast we</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.230" end="00:22:16.850" style="s2">curves if we look at the population</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.850" end="00:22:21.500" style="s2">issues like it it all looks pretty bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:23.480" style="s2">from that point of view and you can try</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.500" end="00:22:25.429" style="s2">and take the technology mister out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.480" end="00:22:27.620" style="s2">say but look at the rate at which we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.429" end="00:22:29.960" style="s2">developing solutions but here&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.580" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">thinking about it is that when lose game</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.700" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">theory is driving the whole thing right</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.970" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">looking at it is a lack of information</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.309" end="00:22:52.610" style="s2">coherence I mean there&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.950" style="s2">coherence and coherence as beings and</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.659" end="00:23:03.230" style="s2">actually a very deep and essential way</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.130" end="00:23:05.419" style="s2">of thinking about it think about a tree</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.230" end="00:23:06.830" style="s2">in an ecosystem and we say well what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.419" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">the value of that tree</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.830" end="00:23:12.500" style="s2">well it&#39;s providing a home for a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:14.270" style="s2">of pollinators and birds it&#39;s providing</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.440" end="00:26:46.039" style="s2">it right it&#39;s like the replicator from</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.299" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">models called gray goo and in a way UV</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.390" end="00:27:21.799" style="s2">you&#39;re right capitalism as gray goo is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:25.010" style="s2">you know we take this tree with this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.799" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">radical contextualized complex value and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.010" end="00:27:30.950" style="s2">take it out of its context and give it</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.950" end="00:27:35.960" style="s2">metric and we&#39;ve done that to 80% of the</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.250" end="00:27:48.620" style="s2">really do other than continue to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:50.690" style="s2">autopoietic thing and so when people</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.620" end="00:27:53.059" style="s2">think about like what is capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.690" end="00:27:55.159" style="s2">honestly like we can say communism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.059" end="00:27:57.530" style="s2">socialism were really actually subsets</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.159" end="00:28:00.620" style="s2">of this kind of resource concentration</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.530" end="00:28:02.150" style="s2">system it&#39;s a process of abstracting</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.620" end="00:28:04.850" style="s2">value so we go from call</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.150" end="00:28:07.190" style="s2">flex value to abstracted value and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.850" end="00:28:09.380" style="s2">extracting it and accumulating it that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.190" end="00:28:12.800" style="s2">particular model came from colleague</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.380" end="00:28:14.210" style="s2">Forrest Landry and no capitalism does</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.800" end="00:28:15.680" style="s2">that but socialism and communism have</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.210" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">other versions of doing that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.680" end="00:28:19.940" style="s2">the core thing that&#39;s the ring of power</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">that has to be broken is abstraction of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.940" end="00:28:25.460" style="s2">value and specifically a reductive</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:27.170" style="s2">abstraction extraction so you remove the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.460" end="00:28:29.780" style="s2">content from its context and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.170" end="00:28:31.820" style="s2">accumulation and that&#39;s how you take a</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:35.870" style="s2">turn it into a complicated system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.010" end="00:28:38.120" style="s2">not resilient that becoming</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.870" end="00:28:39.800" style="s2">progressively simpler in kill it this</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.120" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">brings up something I find to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.800" end="00:28:44.810" style="s2">fascinating which is the use of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:46.250" style="s2">blockchain to tokenize abstract value do</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.810" end="00:28:48.890" style="s2">you have thoughts about this and whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.250" end="00:28:50.390" style="s2">it&#39;s actually possible to do this I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.890" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">get more specific if you need yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.390" end="00:28:54.740" style="s2">please do so we had an interview last</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:28:56.870" style="s2">year with Vince means and he talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.740" end="00:28:59.540" style="s2">about tokenizing these abstract values</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.870" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">actually he used the tree example so</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.540" end="00:29:03.500" style="s2">what if you can tokenize all the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:06.410" style="s2">extra abstract value that a tree</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.500" end="00:29:08.870" style="s2">provides you know have a token for</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.410" end="00:29:11.060" style="s2">oxygen converted that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.870" end="00:29:13.040" style="s2">and what if you can optimize those</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.060" end="00:29:15.980" style="s2">different tokens in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.040" end="00:29:18.350" style="s2">capitalism optimizes capital can we use</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.980" end="00:29:20.900" style="s2">these other systems of value and use</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.350" end="00:29:23.630" style="s2">them as currency as well I say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.900" end="00:29:26.360" style="s2">loosely and optimize that using the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.630" end="00:29:28.580" style="s2">existing capitalist system I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.360" end="00:29:30.050" style="s2">so lazy faire capitalism always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.580" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">goes there it says the tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.050" end="00:29:33.410" style="s2">Commons is because if nobody owns it</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:35.000" style="s2">then they&#39;ll it up but if someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.410" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">owned it they&#39;d take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.000" end="00:29:38.600" style="s2">it so really the answer is to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:40.070" style="s2">everyone own everything every coral reef</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.600" end="00:29:42.470" style="s2">every everything is owned and we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.070" end="00:29:45.110" style="s2">some way of creating capitalists value</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.470" end="00:29:48.590" style="s2">in the process of owning it this breaks</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.110" end="00:29:50.900" style="s2">down for a number of reasons so why is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.590" end="00:29:54.350" style="s2">are not worth anything in gold is worth</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.900" end="00:29:56.450" style="s2">so much because in a win-lose game model</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.350" end="00:29:58.700" style="s2">something that everyone has access to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.450" end="00:30:00.110" style="s2">and can&#39;t not have access to and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.700" end="00:30:03.020" style="s2">get anymore of doesn&#39;t give me</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.110" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">competitive advantage so everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.020" end="00:30:08.420" style="s2">access to air so I don&#39;t need to value</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:11.180" style="s2">it I don&#39;t need to pay attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.420" end="00:30:12.740" style="s2">and now if I cut down this tree of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.180" end="00:30:15.260" style="s2">course I&#39;m cutting down something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.740" end="00:30:15.800" style="s2">produces oxygen and sequester co2 but</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.260" end="00:30:17.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not cutting</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.800" end="00:30:19.130" style="s2">enough to up everything I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.480" end="00:30:20.750" style="s2">cutting down enough to really affect my</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.130" end="00:30:22.520" style="s2">experience at all now of course as you</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.750" end="00:30:24.620" style="s2">get seven billion people with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.520" end="00:30:25.880" style="s2">mindset it becomes a different story but</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.620" end="00:30:28.460" style="s2">distributed lis they&#39;re all thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:32.180" style="s2">about their own action and that if if I</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.460" end="00:30:34.130" style="s2">cut this tree down I have $10,000 worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.180" end="00:30:35.960" style="s2">of 2x4 s in my pocket and I need to feed</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.130" end="00:30:38.180" style="s2">my family and I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.960" end="00:30:40.190" style="s2">measurably less oxygen but multiply that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.180" end="00:30:42.530" style="s2">by seven billion and we all die right</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.190" end="00:30:44.660" style="s2">but if I don&#39;t cut this tree down that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.530" end="00:30:46.250" style="s2">tree in the Commons is worth nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.660" end="00:30:48.350" style="s2">me in terms of differential or</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.250" end="00:30:51.350" style="s2">competitive advantage and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.350" end="00:30:54.020" style="s2">system where pre something like basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.350" end="00:30:55.940" style="s2">income even before competitive advantage</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.020" end="00:30:57.710" style="s2">I just need to live right so if I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.940" end="00:30:59.210" style="s2">take something out of the Commons to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.710" end="00:31:02.600" style="s2">live like I&#39;m gonna do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.210" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">so gold or diamonds or whatever are</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.600" end="00:31:06.230" style="s2">worth a lot because they were perceived</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:08.600" style="s2">as scarce when we started the valuation</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.230" end="00:31:10.730" style="s2">schema and if there wasn&#39;t enough for</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.600" end="00:31:12.170" style="s2">everyone to have lots of it then some</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.730" end="00:31:13.880" style="s2">people could have it and others wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.170" end="00:31:15.170" style="s2">and those who had it had something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.880" end="00:31:17.990" style="s2">was unique where they had some</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.170" end="00:31:19.730" style="s2">differential advantage but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.990" end="00:31:22.700" style="s2">Fiat right like whether it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.730" end="00:31:24.740" style="s2">printed dollars or gold that we ascribe</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.700" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">that value to that is not based on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.740" end="00:31:28.250" style="s2">the actual material value of the golden</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:30.350" style="s2">and we set it in bats it&#39;s still like</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.250" end="00:31:32.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a value metric that we made up and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.350" end="00:31:34.730" style="s2">so we&#39;ll have gold worth you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.300" end="00:31:36.260" style="s2">however much per ounce and because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.730" end="00:31:37.610" style="s2">that if there&#39;s gold under some trees</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.260" end="00:31:39.500" style="s2">we&#39;ll cut down a lot of trees to get the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.610" end="00:31:41.690" style="s2">gold out and burn up the oxygen or</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.500" end="00:31:43.880" style="s2">damage it in the process because we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.690" end="00:31:47.960" style="s2">a system that is valuing differential</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.880" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">value not systemic value that&#39;s if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.960" end="00:31:52.430" style="s2">start saying well how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.160" end="00:31:54.470" style="s2">advance systemic value and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.430" end="00:31:56.660" style="s2">really tokenize that because as long as</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.470" end="00:31:58.100" style="s2">there are separate balance sheets and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.660" end="00:31:59.870" style="s2">have some number of tokens and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.100" end="00:32:02.060" style="s2">trying to advance the number of tokens</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.870" end="00:32:03.830" style="s2">that I have in competition with other</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.060" end="00:32:06.500" style="s2">members we&#39;re gonna keep getting all</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.830" end="00:32:09.080" style="s2">these win-lose dynamics right so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.500" end="00:32:10.910" style="s2">post capitalist move is a deeper move</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.080" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">than that now does that mean that tokens</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.910" end="00:32:13.960" style="s2">and blockchain can&#39;t serve a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">transitionary role no of course they can</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.960" end="00:32:17.750" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:20.630" style="s2">we make up the currency units you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.750" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">through a central bank well you can have</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.630" end="00:32:25.460" style="s2">another group make up a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:27.800" style="s2">of unit and you can build some better</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.460" end="00:32:28.820" style="s2">structures into that unit and that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.800" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.820" end="00:32:32.870" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:35.420" style="s2">but as long as we still have private</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.870" end="00:32:37.100" style="s2">ownership of those units that if I have</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.420" end="00:32:38.660" style="s2">more of the units to begin with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.100" end="00:32:40.130" style="s2">easier to get more of them if I have</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.660" end="00:32:42.230" style="s2">less to begin with it&#39;s harder to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.130" end="00:32:44.929" style="s2">more of them so I have widening wealth</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.230" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">caps built in all of the other shitty</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.929" end="00:32:49.490" style="s2">aspects of capitalism all of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:52.070" style="s2">derivatives and complex financial</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.490" end="00:32:54.799" style="s2">instruments and up markets will</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.070" end="00:32:56.120" style="s2">end up arising from those competitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.799" end="00:32:59.390" style="s2">structures those are just basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">inexorable ways to game the game so then</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.390" end="00:33:06.020" style="s2">our so what do we do we do need a</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:09.290" style="s2">completely new economics we do need a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.020" end="00:33:11.150" style="s2">completely new system of sense-making we</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.290" end="00:33:13.870" style="s2">do need a completely new system of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.150" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">choice making right governance add an</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.870" end="00:33:18.679" style="s2">axiomatically redesigned level and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:20.990" style="s2">know when most people when you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.679" end="00:33:23.000" style="s2">what is economics they think well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.990" end="00:33:24.440" style="s2">system of trade system of barter right</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.000" end="00:33:26.990" style="s2">they&#39;re already assuming private</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.440" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">ownership and trade and barter that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.990" end="00:33:31.190" style="s2">then mediated by some kind of currency</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:32.780" style="s2">but you have systems that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.190" end="00:33:34.370" style="s2">private ownership that don&#39;t have trade</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.780" end="00:33:35.720" style="s2">right because I don&#39;t own to trade</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.370" end="00:33:37.640" style="s2">to you we have some kind of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.720" end="00:33:40.070" style="s2">value we just didn&#39;t like those ones</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.640" end="00:33:41.950" style="s2">because for the most part we thought of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.070" end="00:33:45.049" style="s2">those as communist socialist systems</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.950" end="00:33:47.419" style="s2">where if I didn&#39;t privately own stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.049" end="00:33:48.770" style="s2">then the state was giving me what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.419" end="00:33:50.120" style="s2">needed but then the state was also</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.770" end="00:33:52.910" style="s2">forcing me to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.120" end="00:33:55.070" style="s2">because as long as there are shitty jobs</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.910" end="00:33:57.260" style="s2">that nobody wants to do that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.070" end="00:33:59.030" style="s2">have intrinsic motive to do but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.260" end="00:34:00.980" style="s2">society needs done how do you get the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.030" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">people to do the shitty jobs well if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.980" end="00:34:04.940" style="s2">kind of meet everyone this needs</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:07.549" style="s2">throughout this thing called like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.940" end="00:34:08.990" style="s2">state then the state has to force some</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.549" end="00:34:10.310" style="s2">people to do the shitty job so we call</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.990" end="00:34:12.350" style="s2">that imperialism and we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.310" end="00:34:13.460" style="s2">communism because it&#39;s imperialists so</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.350" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">we say well let&#39;s let the free market</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.460" end="00:34:17.419" style="s2">force them which is if they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:18.740" style="s2">smarter and educate themselves better to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.419" end="00:34:20.480" style="s2">do a better job then they get the shitty</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.740" end="00:34:22.070" style="s2">jobs and if they don&#39;t the state isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.480" end="00:34:23.750" style="s2">forcing them but they will still be</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.070" end="00:34:26.300" style="s2">homeless and starved it&#39;s just where do</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.750" end="00:34:27.710" style="s2">we where do we switch the imperialism</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:29.960" style="s2">right we switch it from the state to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.710" end="00:34:31.609" style="s2">to the market but we&#39;re basically we</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.960" end="00:34:33.800" style="s2">still have to have a system of extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.609" end="00:34:35.030" style="s2">incentive to control people to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.800" end="00:34:37.369" style="s2">that they&#39;re not intrinsically oriented</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.030" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">to do well okay so that&#39;s been part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.369" end="00:34:40.460" style="s2">what we&#39;ve had to work with and Marx had</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">thoughts on it and Smith had its</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.460" end="00:34:43.160" style="s2">thoughts on it but technological</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:44.870" style="s2">unemployment is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.160" end="00:34:46.340" style="s2">changing that whole story where</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.870" end="00:34:48.980" style="s2">you can start to automate the shittiest</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.340" end="00:34:50.330" style="s2">jobs so you can have a system where the</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.530" end="00:35:04.370" style="s2">do we deal with the labor force an axiom</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.360" end="00:35:06.740" style="s2">is changing and so we have to go back</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.370" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">and rethink all of our economic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.740" end="00:35:11.930" style="s2">and with regard to sense making there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:13.220" style="s2">a lot of core things that are changing</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.930" end="00:35:15.560" style="s2">in terms of our capacity for cents</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.220" end="00:35:18.470" style="s2">making you know we have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.560" end="00:35:20.120" style="s2">have IOT sensors right Internet of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.470" end="00:35:22.820" style="s2">Things sensors that are giving us</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.120" end="00:35:24.530" style="s2">real-time data about air chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.820" end="00:35:26.660" style="s2">water chemistry and soil chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.530" end="00:35:29.540" style="s2">Fisheries in the Commons and etc and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.660" end="00:35:31.250" style="s2">have deep learning systems that can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.540" end="00:35:32.990" style="s2">synthesizing that information we like we</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.250" end="00:35:34.550" style="s2">never had sense-making systems like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.990" end="00:35:35.990" style="s2">like we didn&#39;t even have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.550" end="00:35:38.360" style="s2">technological capacity for things like</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.990" end="00:35:40.520" style="s2">that and choice-making systems so</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.360" end="00:35:42.170" style="s2">basically we are at the face of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.520" end="00:35:43.820" style="s2">issues and we&#39;ve ever been at the face</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.170" end="00:35:46.430" style="s2">of before but also with deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.820" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">capacities so the same increased</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.430" end="00:35:51.770" style="s2">technological capacity that if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.410" end="00:35:53.990" style="s2">using it to take complex things and make</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.770" end="00:35:56.960" style="s2">them simple simple or complicated</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.990" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">instead of complex and we keep using it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.960" end="00:36:00.710" style="s2">to fight against each other and win in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.900" style="s2">competitive win lose games if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.710" end="00:36:05.360" style="s2">doing that with these increased</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.900" end="00:36:07.430" style="s2">technologies that&#39;s existential but if</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.360" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">we use those technologies to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.430" end="00:36:12.200" style="s2">obsolete those core social structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:14.750" style="s2">and create coherency based social</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.200" end="00:36:18.050" style="s2">structures where that technology can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.750" end="00:36:20.390" style="s2">used for not against then I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.050" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">really do have a fork between radically</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.390" end="00:36:26.540" style="s2">better than anything we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:28.580" style="s2">experienced or catastrophic well so now</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.540" end="00:36:30.950" style="s2">my question is we talked about all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.580" end="00:36:34.670" style="s2">different structures that we can create</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.950" end="00:36:36.980" style="s2">for humanity to exist within but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.670" end="00:36:38.780" style="s2">also human nature and not just human</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.980" end="00:36:41.810" style="s2">nature but the nature of something being</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.780" end="00:36:45.320" style="s2">alive as essentially being a replicator</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.810" end="00:36:48.860" style="s2">machine so we have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.320" end="00:36:52.010" style="s2">intrinsic tendencies that may be very</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.860" end="00:36:53.660" style="s2">difficult to hack and no matter how you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.010" end="00:36:56.990" style="s2">structure the system we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.660" end="00:36:58.550" style="s2">default to those tendencies for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.990" end="00:37:00.350" style="s2">you know that&#39;s probably one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.550" end="00:37:02.330" style="s2">reasons why communism didn&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.350" end="00:37:04.460" style="s2">just in some ways it probably went</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.330" end="00:37:07.190" style="s2">against human nature or the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.460" end="00:37:10.820" style="s2">just a lot of things that are alive so</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.190" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">how do we deal with that in your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.820" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not why communism didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:17.810" style="s2">though yes there were things about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">way it was structured that did not</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.810" end="00:37:20.990" style="s2">structure themselves well with humans</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s important to get that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.990" end="00:37:24.650" style="s2">like it wasn&#39;t a good structure and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:25.940" style="s2"> up human nature was the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.650" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">if that it actually wasn&#39;t a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.940" end="00:37:31.340" style="s2">structure there were good parts of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:33.590" style="s2">but in trying to keep us from having</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.340" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">economic inequality because economic</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.590" end="00:37:36.890" style="s2">inequality would continue to inexorably</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:39.560" style="s2">widen it became a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.890" end="00:37:42.500" style="s2">lowest-common-denominator system and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.560" end="00:37:44.390" style="s2">became a system of lack of freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.500" end="00:37:45.500" style="s2">some really key ways so yes it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.390" end="00:37:47.360" style="s2">against our nature it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.500" end="00:37:48.860" style="s2">against good parts of our nature so then</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.360" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">the question is are there shitty parts</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.860" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">of our nature or inexorably problematic</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.590" end="00:37:54.740" style="s2">parts of our nature this will be the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:58.610" style="s2">hardest part of the conversation so far</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.740" end="00:38:01.940" style="s2">because I&#39;m going to say that what we</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.610" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">call human nature is mostly human</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.940" end="00:38:06.530" style="s2">conditioning that is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.090" style="s2">changeable and I don&#39;t even mean genetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.530" end="00:38:10.609" style="s2">engineering or brain computer interface</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.090" end="00:38:11.960" style="s2">are necessary let&#39;s unpack this this the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.609" end="00:38:14.470" style="s2">question you asked is an essential</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.960" end="00:38:17.780" style="s2">question when we look at Japan or</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.470" end="00:38:20.390" style="s2">Denmark or I think there&#39;s a few Nordic</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.780" end="00:38:22.220" style="s2">countries that have had decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.390" end="00:38:24.680" style="s2">populations after they reach a certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.220" end="00:38:26.810" style="s2">level of economics in education it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.680" end="00:38:29.060" style="s2">not that the nature is to do exponential</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.810" end="00:38:30.230" style="s2">population curves forever it that is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.060" end="00:38:32.030" style="s2">nature within a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.230" end="00:38:34.369" style="s2">conditions when the conditions change</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.030" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">many of the deepest like even</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.369" end="00:38:38.750" style="s2">procreation behavioral dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.490" style="s2">drive start to shift without externally</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.750" end="00:38:42.290" style="s2">imposed things like birth caps at China</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.490" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">had it&#39;s really important to see that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.290" end="00:38:47.000" style="s2">when you look at some of the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:48.410" style="s2">cultures pre capitalism that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.000" end="00:38:50.330" style="s2">private ownership they had shared</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.410" end="00:38:52.220" style="s2">structures and they had languages that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.330" end="00:38:55.820" style="s2">express that concept of sharing they had</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.220" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">radically de-emphasized words like mine</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.820" end="00:39:01.520" style="s2">and radically increased words like ours</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:03.740" style="s2">in any of those cultures we can see some</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.520" end="00:39:05.720" style="s2">of that in some of the Fijian Polynesian</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.740" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">cultures the mas wah you know number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.720" end="00:39:11.230" style="s2">them wherever the mine language was</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:13.300" style="s2">less emphasizing the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.230" end="00:39:15.010" style="s2">language also words like selfish and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.300" end="00:39:16.780" style="s2">greedy and jealous were less emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.010" end="00:39:20.590" style="s2">because those are the results of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.780" end="00:39:22.990" style="s2">structures of scarcity based value in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.590" end="00:39:25.090" style="s2">competitive framework structures so when</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.990" end="00:39:26.620" style="s2">we say what is human nature it does a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.090" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">little bit that&#39;s definitely human</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.620" end="00:39:30.250" style="s2">nature like an impulse to write oneself</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:32.140" style="s2">when they start falling or to pull away</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.250" end="00:39:34.990" style="s2">from hot right like of these autonomic</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.140" end="00:39:36.760" style="s2">functions those are nature but so like</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.990" end="00:39:38.290" style="s2">when you say we would get what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.760" end="00:39:41.470" style="s2">essentially human nature what was</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.290" end="00:39:45.400" style="s2">uniquely adaptive about us is that our</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.470" end="00:39:47.320" style="s2">genetic selected for memetics right our</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.400" end="00:39:49.720" style="s2">genetic selected for a creature that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.320" end="00:39:51.820" style="s2">could continue evolving itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.720" end="00:39:54.970" style="s2">developing itself within the course of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.820" end="00:39:57.010" style="s2">its life pretty radically which is why a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.970" end="00:39:59.260" style="s2">baby horse can be up and walking in</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.010" end="00:40:01.570" style="s2">minutes and it takes us a year think</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.260" end="00:40:03.130" style="s2">about how many multiples of the twenty</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.570" end="00:40:05.740" style="s2">minutes it takes a horse to get up go</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.130" end="00:40:07.840" style="s2">into a year for a human how useless we</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.740" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">are for so long even a baby gorilla can</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.840" end="00:40:12.580" style="s2">hold onto its mom&#39;s first she moves</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">around to the trees in the first day we</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.580" end="00:40:17.830" style="s2">can&#39;t even move our head for three</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.720" end="00:40:21.060" style="s2">months right and that&#39;s because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.830" end="00:40:23.860" style="s2">born jnanis were born basically still</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.060" end="00:40:26.080" style="s2">embryos we&#39;re we&#39;re imprinting the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.860" end="00:40:27.490" style="s2">were born into because as complex tool</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.080" end="00:40:29.890" style="s2">makers and tool evolvers with our</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.490" end="00:40:32.110" style="s2">capacity for abstraction we evolved the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.890" end="00:40:34.750" style="s2">environment around us radically and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.110" end="00:40:36.100" style="s2">creatures they evolved genetically to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.750" end="00:40:37.930" style="s2">their environmental niche but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.100" end="00:40:39.100" style="s2">changing our own environment so we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.930" end="00:40:41.560" style="s2">to be able to adapt to new environments</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.100" end="00:40:43.990" style="s2">that we create so we have to come in not</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.560" end="00:40:45.340" style="s2">hardwired because it was super adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.990" end="00:40:46.990" style="s2">to be able to throw a spear at one point</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.340" end="00:40:48.610" style="s2">but today like you and me don&#39;t throw</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.990" end="00:40:51.340" style="s2">Spears that much we text and we do other</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.610" end="00:40:53.470" style="s2"> so we need to not just have really</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.340" end="00:40:55.690" style="s2">good genetic orientation for spear throw</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.470" end="00:40:57.700" style="s2">and we need to have the capacity to come</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.690" end="00:40:59.350" style="s2">here with almost nothing not even move</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.700" end="00:41:01.710" style="s2">our head and imprint the world that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.350" end="00:41:04.270" style="s2">we&#39;re in and so that memetics is</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.710" end="00:41:06.730" style="s2">mediated largely through neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.270" end="00:41:08.950" style="s2">and the ability to have a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.730" end="00:41:10.840" style="s2">behavior not just bottom-up genetically</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.950" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">controlled but talk-down regulated and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.840" end="00:41:14.550" style="s2">the top-down systems are highly</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:17.230" style="s2">influenceable and so we can say humans</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.550" end="00:41:19.840" style="s2">genetic selected for plasticity and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.230" end="00:41:22.120" style="s2">plasticity has a pretty huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.840" end="00:41:23.330" style="s2">variance in its capability and so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.120" end="00:41:25.400" style="s2">know we can create an environment</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.330" end="00:41:28.460" style="s2">like in you know look at the child</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.400" end="00:41:30.050" style="s2">shoulder situations in Sudan or places</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:31.970" style="s2">like that where we can take almost</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.050" end="00:41:34.040" style="s2">everyone through a process that makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.970" end="00:41:36.050" style="s2">various degrees of psychopathy we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.040" end="00:41:38.870" style="s2">also you know like look at Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.050" end="00:41:41.660" style="s2">culture where you had millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.870" end="00:41:43.850" style="s2">all care about insects enough to not</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.660" end="00:41:46.580" style="s2">harm them right beyond the Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.850" end="00:41:48.860" style="s2">they had a something that developed</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.580" end="00:41:50.870" style="s2">abstract empathy across the population</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.860" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">and so that doesn&#39;t mean humans are</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.870" end="00:41:54.200" style="s2">naturally psychopaths or naturally</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:41:56.180" style="s2">highly empathetic it means we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.200" end="00:41:58.760" style="s2">naturally capable of being conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.180" end="00:42:01.220" style="s2">in either of those ways or any of many</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.760" end="00:42:04.840" style="s2">different ways we do have an innate</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.220" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">impulse towards agency towards</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.840" end="00:42:08.600" style="s2">self-actualization within a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:10.910" style="s2">game structure that will look like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.600" end="00:42:12.770" style="s2">competitive impulse but within other</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.910" end="00:42:14.510" style="s2">structures and win-win structures that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.770" end="00:42:17.150" style="s2">will look like the desire to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.510" end="00:42:20.150" style="s2">my own previous capacity but not to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.150" end="00:42:22.340" style="s2">necessarily be better than or you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.150" end="00:42:24.110" style="s2">consume somebody or something else and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.340" end="00:42:26.570" style="s2">so that&#39;s where there is an innate</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.110" end="00:42:29.120" style="s2">impulse but that expresses itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.570" end="00:42:30.830" style="s2">through context no let&#39;s take the next</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.120" end="00:42:33.500" style="s2">step there&#39;s another really key step</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.830" end="00:42:35.300" style="s2">here until very recently humans didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.500" end="00:42:37.730" style="s2">have any concept of what evolution was</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.300" end="00:42:39.710" style="s2">and we only recently did and we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.730" end="00:42:42.260" style="s2">right now beginning to have a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.710" end="00:42:44.900" style="s2">of what it actually is not just biologic</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.260" end="00:42:46.610" style="s2">natural selection but the process by</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.900" end="00:42:48.500" style="s2">which subatomic particles come into</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.610" end="00:42:50.450" style="s2">atoms come into molecules come into more</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.500" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">complex organic structures the dust</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.450" end="00:42:54.890" style="s2">clouds turn into stars and spiral</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:57.260" style="s2">galaxies that there is that evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.890" end="00:42:59.780" style="s2">this process of increasing orderly</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.260" end="00:43:02.990" style="s2">complexity in a way that has more and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.780" end="00:43:04.610" style="s2">more synergy so more and more emergent</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.990" end="00:43:06.830" style="s2">property and the emergent properties</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.610" end="00:43:08.900" style="s2">define the arrow of evolution and as</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.830" end="00:43:10.340" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to understand this you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.900" end="00:43:11.690" style="s2">know like very few people but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.340" end="00:43:14.360" style="s2">beginning of us starting to understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.690" end="00:43:17.270" style="s2">this we can actually become conscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.360" end="00:43:18.920" style="s2">agents of evolution we can like I say</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.270" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">holy universe&#39;s actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.920" end="00:43:21.800" style="s2">something it&#39;s actually moving in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:23.390" style="s2">direction of increasing orderly</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.800" end="00:43:25.940" style="s2">complexity we can consciously</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.390" end="00:43:27.950" style="s2">participate with that and we move from</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.940" end="00:43:29.180" style="s2">just being a part of the whole where</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.950" end="00:43:31.460" style="s2">evolution is just kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.180" end="00:43:33.800" style="s2">unconscious algorithmic process so</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.460" end="00:43:36.650" style="s2">thinking about feeling about identifying</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.800" end="00:43:39.890" style="s2">with and being an agent for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.650" end="00:43:42.140" style="s2">and so then evolution itself becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.890" end="00:43:44.029" style="s2">identically mediated process like we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.140" end="00:43:46.069" style="s2">actually say the whole evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.029" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">process resulted in me I am the result</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.069" end="00:43:49.640" style="s2">of this whole evolutionary process - in</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.619" style="s2">a way the evolutionary process is kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.640" end="00:43:53.690" style="s2">of awoke to itself in me as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.619" end="00:43:56.180" style="s2">contemplating it and so then we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.690" end="00:43:58.700" style="s2">needing pushed by evolutionary pressure</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.180" end="00:44:02.059" style="s2">and pain to evolve and we start being</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.700" end="00:44:03.890" style="s2">able to evolve consciously by what tear</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.059" end="00:44:06.650" style="s2">- are down called the lure of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.890" end="00:44:09.020" style="s2">because we actually identify as</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.650" end="00:44:11.150" style="s2">evolutionary&#39;s right as as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.020" end="00:44:13.549" style="s2">evolutionary impulse and in doing so</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:15.410" style="s2">really obsolete the need for pain as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.549" end="00:44:18.289" style="s2">evolutionary driver so I know I said a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.410" end="00:44:21.770" style="s2">number of things in there but human</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.289" end="00:44:25.039" style="s2">nature has the capacity to transcend</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.770" end="00:44:29.539" style="s2">much of what human behavior has been so</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.039" end="00:44:33.220" style="s2">far so well said it&#39;s like we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.539" end="00:44:37.010" style="s2">tentacles of the universe or something</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.220" end="00:44:39.380" style="s2">yeah the sensors and the actuators right</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.010" end="00:44:41.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a quite a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.380" end="00:44:45.079" style="s2">proposition to that we are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.960" end="00:44:47.480" style="s2">conscious of what we are and acting</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.079" end="00:44:49.640" style="s2">based on that realization yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.480" end="00:44:51.589" style="s2">actually don&#39;t think anything less than</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.640" end="00:44:53.809" style="s2">that is adequate for preventing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.589" end="00:44:55.849" style="s2">existential risk and that&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.809" end="00:44:57.849" style="s2">that really frames up what we&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.849" end="00:45:01.700" style="s2">talk about which is as we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.849" end="00:45:04.609" style="s2">increasingly distributed exponential</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.700" end="00:45:08.059" style="s2">ability for impact we really have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.609" end="00:45:10.190" style="s2">have exponentially increasing good</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:17.240" style="s2">we talk about wind Lou&#39;s game theory at</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.020" end="00:45:19.099" style="s2">the deepest level it starts with me</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.240" end="00:45:20.809" style="s2">having a sense of self that&#39;s separate</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.099" end="00:45:22.609" style="s2">from everything else even all the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.809" end="00:45:24.529" style="s2">down to the semiotic stew the language</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.609" end="00:45:27.559" style="s2">right I was told when I was a little kid</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.529" end="00:45:29.750" style="s2">I&#39;m Daniel and your mic and your UV and</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:23.109" style="s2">turn it into wood it&#39;s worth a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.109" end="00:47:25.299" style="s2">less the context had it was its value</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.109" end="00:47:29.259" style="s2">right its value was the content within</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.960" end="00:47:37.180" style="s2">don&#39;t even exist and so when I get that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.839" end="00:47:39.640" style="s2">I am a misnomer as a separate thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.180" end="00:47:41.619" style="s2">really I am an emergent property of the</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.450" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">because without the Sun I wouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:50.920" style="s2">laws of universe I wouldn&#39;t I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.519" end="00:47:52.809" style="s2">emergent property of universe and so are</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.920" end="00:47:56.349" style="s2">you and we&#39;re interconnected in this and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.809" end="00:47:58.690" style="s2">that&#39;s waking up at a cognitive level at</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.349" end="00:48:01.780" style="s2">a existential at a spiritual level and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.690" end="00:48:03.550" style="s2">really we need new macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.780" end="00:48:06.070" style="s2">economics is basically what do we value</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.550" end="00:48:07.720" style="s2">don&#39;t value oxygen because we can&#39;t get</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.720" end="00:48:10.180" style="s2">though we&#39;d all die without it but value</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.180" end="00:48:13.060" style="s2">competitive advantage even though I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.380" end="00:48:14.860" style="s2">just gonna stick it in a safe not do</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.060" end="00:48:16.210" style="s2">anything with it value the whale dead</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.860" end="00:48:17.650" style="s2">because I can do stuff with it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.210" end="00:48:20.470" style="s2">value it live right like what do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.650" end="00:48:22.360" style="s2">value our value system is codified in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.470" end="00:48:24.430" style="s2">value equation that then determines what</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.360" end="00:48:27.100" style="s2">we confer power to that&#39;s economics</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.430" end="00:48:29.770" style="s2">totally spiritual thing so we need new</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.100" end="00:48:32.650" style="s2">macroeconomics that aligns the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.770" end="00:48:34.330" style="s2">of every agent with the well-being of</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.330" end="00:48:39.340" style="s2">because any gap between your incentive</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.340" end="00:48:43.450" style="s2">the well-being of the Commons then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.740" end="00:48:45.970" style="s2">will do what you&#39;re intended to do and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.450" end="00:48:47.860" style="s2">you will externalize harm directly or</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.970" end="00:48:49.960" style="s2">indirectly right and with exponential</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.960" end="00:48:53.860" style="s2">always become catastrophic eventually so</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.970" end="00:48:56.140" style="s2">we need new macro economics that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.860" end="00:48:58.090" style="s2">fundamentally align our well-beings with</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.140" end="00:49:00.520" style="s2">each other and in doing so we have no</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.090" end="00:49:02.790" style="s2">incentive for disinformation we only</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.520" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">have incentive for information so now</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.790" end="00:49:07.060" style="s2">science becomes science actually right</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:08.320" style="s2">in journalism actually come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.060" end="00:49:09.580" style="s2">journalism we can actually make</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.320" end="00:49:11.500" style="s2">sense of stuff because I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.580" end="00:49:12.820" style="s2">hide information from you or lead you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.500" end="00:49:15.400" style="s2">down the wrong track so I get there</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.820" end="00:49:17.500" style="s2">first and we need you know so like new</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.400" end="00:49:19.270" style="s2">macroeconomics new sense make new</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.500" end="00:49:21.460" style="s2">systems of choice making all the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.270" end="00:49:24.070" style="s2">down to a new world view where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.460" end="00:49:26.170" style="s2">actually identify with the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.070" end="00:49:28.840" style="s2">impulse so we don&#39;t need pain to push us</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.170" end="00:49:31.270" style="s2">we are evolving right we&#39;re being and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.840" end="00:49:33.100" style="s2">becoming and doing at the same time for</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.270" end="00:49:36.340" style="s2">ourselves and the whole at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.100" end="00:49:38.380" style="s2">and all the way down to our personal</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.340" end="00:49:41.470" style="s2">identity shifting from being a separate</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.380" end="00:49:44.770" style="s2">self which is just nonsense to being a</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.550" end="00:49:55.300" style="s2">stuff that I haven&#39;t you have a</p>

<p begin="00:50:19.720" end="00:50:25.600" style="s2">right how much money do we have or how</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:28.270" style="s2">fast can you run or whatever right but</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.600" end="00:50:30.730" style="s2">when we go back to the full metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.270" end="00:50:33.400" style="s2">it&#39;s basically an indefinite number of</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.400" end="00:50:37.270" style="s2">of those they&#39;re incomparable so now the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.350" end="00:50:39.580" style="s2">competition thing is gone because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.270" end="00:50:41.710" style="s2">I&#39;m identified with this whole complex</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:50.140" style="s2">you self actualizing not only doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.430" end="00:50:52.510" style="s2">take away from me you self actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.140" end="00:50:55.120" style="s2">makes a more beautiful universe in a way</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.100" end="00:51:02.320" style="s2">to help you self actualize the gist of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.500" end="00:51:06.730" style="s2">the story as I see it is that we awaken</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.450" end="00:51:44.530" style="s2">does an exponent scale - as we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.700" end="00:51:47.260" style="s2">towards having the power of gods like</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.500" end="00:51:57.700" style="s2">War two and she saw that mushroom cloud</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.510" end="00:52:03.910" style="s2">so she went and asked and she asked</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.910" end="00:52:09.490" style="s2">and you know the other generals I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.940" end="00:52:10.840" style="s2">MacArthur and she said I see this new</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.490" end="00:52:13.180" style="s2">power that we have and I see the power</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.840" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">of it that&#39;s bad what is the power of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.180" end="00:52:17.080" style="s2">that&#39;s good and they had no answer and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:19.240" style="s2">so she set out on that life quest to</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.240" end="00:52:23.410" style="s2">this other part of it we can ask is if</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.410" end="00:52:28.839" style="s2">then you have to have the wisdom and the</p>

<p begin="00:52:28.839" end="00:52:31.719" style="s2">and so you know when you do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.519" end="00:52:33.279" style="s2">it in those mythic terms it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.719" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">that&#39;s really that&#39;s really the story</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.279" end="00:52:39.009" style="s2">right now and so the other part of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:41.049" style="s2">mythic term is you know the coming of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.009" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">different age and an age that is not</p>

<p begin="01:00:28.029" end="01:00:32.349" style="s2">an in heartening thing Daniel do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.249" end="01:00:33.819" style="s2">have any book recommendations for our</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.349" end="01:00:36.609" style="s2">listeners if they want to continue</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.819" end="01:00:38.650" style="s2">learning about these subjects yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.609" end="01:00:40.599" style="s2">as we were just talking about a game</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.650" end="01:00:42.609" style="s2">that&#39;s ending in the new game that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.599" end="01:00:45.489" style="s2">book infinite and finite games by James</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.609" end="01:00:48.069" style="s2">Carr says a really great introduction to</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.489" end="01:00:50.440" style="s2">thinking about what a world beyond game</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.069" end="01:00:52.569" style="s2">theory is and it&#39;s short and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.440" end="01:00:54.489" style="s2">actually like it is both an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.569" end="01:00:55.809" style="s2">treatise on economics and governance and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.489" end="01:00:59.619" style="s2">social systems and a really profound</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.809" end="01:01:02.799" style="s2">spiritual book so I recommend that one</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.619" end="01:01:04.660" style="s2">infinite and finite games and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.799" end="01:01:07.299" style="s2">books like the collapse of complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.660" end="01:01:09.190" style="s2">societies by Tainter they go through all</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.299" end="01:01:10.869" style="s2">of the you know civilizations of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.190" end="01:01:13.480" style="s2">past that collapse and how and why they</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.869" end="01:01:15.160" style="s2">collapse is a very sobering insight for</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.480" end="01:01:17.140" style="s2">people to realize that you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.160" end="01:01:18.549" style="s2">existential risk and a whole species and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.140" end="01:01:20.019" style="s2">a whole global level we&#39;ve never faced</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.549" end="01:01:22.660" style="s2">before but we have at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.019" end="01:01:25.510" style="s2">civilizations and we almost always fail</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.660" end="01:01:26.590" style="s2">and to kind of understand why so that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.510" end="01:01:28.690" style="s2">can make sure we you&#39;re not repeating</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.590" end="01:01:31.570" style="s2">that that&#39;s actually very valuable very</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.690" end="01:01:34.510" style="s2">insightful and if people want to read</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.570" end="01:01:36.370" style="s2">you know about existential risk itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.510" end="01:01:38.200" style="s2">you know going to the future of life</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.370" end="01:01:40.120" style="s2">Institute or the Cambridge Center for</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.200" end="01:01:41.850" style="s2">the Study of existential risk places</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.120" end="01:01:44.050" style="s2">like that and reading their reports</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.850" end="01:01:46.440" style="s2">those things have a lot of value going</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.050" end="01:01:49.870" style="s2">even back to like limits of growth and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.440" end="01:01:51.820" style="s2">the world 3 model it&#39;s surprising how</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.870" end="01:01:53.530" style="s2">many places the world 3 model was</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.820" end="01:01:55.660" style="s2">accurate from you know when it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.530" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">started so there&#39;s still value in limits</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.660" end="01:01:59.440" style="s2">of growth all of those are good ones if</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:02:00.730" style="s2">I had to pick one for people to start</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.440" end="01:02:02.290" style="s2">with from here I&#39;d say infinite and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.730" end="01:02:05.190" style="s2">finite games just a good start cool</p>
