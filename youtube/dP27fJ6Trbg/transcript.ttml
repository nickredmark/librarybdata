<p begin="00:00:05.420" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">hello you found the portal</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.710" end="00:00:11.480" style="s2">I&#39;m your host Eric Weinstein and today I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">get to sit down with one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.480" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">conversationalist Tyler Cowen who&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:19.260" style="s2">from George Mason University where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:22.680" style="s2">a professor of economics Tyler welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.260" end="00:00:24.510" style="s2">to the portal thank you Eric now when we</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.680" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">were talking about what topics we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.510" end="00:00:28.320" style="s2">begin with I didn&#39;t want to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">economics and you suggested the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">apocalypse is a great place to start now</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:35.130" style="s2">the great benefit of this is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">get past it the rest of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.130" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">will be post apocalyptic the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:42.390" style="s2">itself is economics of course but I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">just thinking that virtually any good</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">theory of politics needs some notion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">the apocalypse but say you thought the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:51.390" style="s2">time horizon for the universe or a human</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">civilization were potentially infinite</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.390" end="00:00:55.949" style="s2">you would then be so concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">minimizing existential risk that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.949" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">would get done</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">whereas if you think well you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">mankind has another 800 years left on</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">earth on average and by that time</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">probably will have blown ourselves up or</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">an asteroid will come then you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">what glorious things can we do with</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">those 800 years and it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">difference in perspective so an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">time horizon might actually choked off</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">rational thought about political</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">decision-making so is there any</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">possibility for keeping the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">exactly 800 years away like a donkey</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">with a carrot dangled in front of it at</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:28.770" style="s2">a fixed distance that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">Strauss II in view right that you always</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.770" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s 800 years away but think of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">it as like a problem from from finance</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">so you&#39;re writing they could put on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">security well it&#39;s going to bankrupt you</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">at some point but any given month any</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">given day the chance of that happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">is probably quite small so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">apocalypse may be like the proverbial</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">naked put it&#39;s out there the chance is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">very small the optimists always sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">like they&#39;re right in the sense they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">right as Steven Pinker would claim but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">at the end of the day if the clock ticks</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">for long enough its boom and buy but in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">the meantime let&#39;s do something grand</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">and glorious now Tyler you have a sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">of a portfolio of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">communicating with the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:13.330" style="s2">have you ever dragged Steven Pinker onto</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">a podcast which you do under Congress</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">with Tyler or have you discussed his</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:22.210" style="s2">bizarre notion of optimism on your</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:23.710" style="s2">famous economics blog marginal</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.210" end="00:02:26.620" style="s2">revolutions which you do with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.710" end="00:02:28.390" style="s2">colleague Alex my podcast conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.620" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">with Tyler has an episode with Steven</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.390" end="00:02:32.440" style="s2">Pinker and I sat him down in a chair the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:34.870" style="s2">way you did with me and I said Steven</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:37.450" style="s2">the cost of destroying the world by</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.870" end="00:02:39.400" style="s2">pressing a button is falling all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.450" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">time every year at some point it will</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.400" end="00:02:43.810" style="s2">only cost say twenty thousand dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:45.070" style="s2">take out a major city how long do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.810" end="00:02:45.490" style="s2">think the world is actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.070" end="00:02:47.320" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.490" end="00:02:48.760" style="s2">given that demand curve sloped downwards</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.320" end="00:02:51.100" style="s2">when prices fall people do more of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.760" end="00:02:53.260" style="s2">things destructive weaponry is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.100" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">cheaper how can you be optimistic I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.260" end="00:02:57.250" style="s2">asked him no good answer I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:58.570" style="s2">evasion he said well my theory is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.250" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">predictive it&#39;s just a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.570" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">about it uh so so it instantly falls</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">apart it falls apart I don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:10.390" style="s2">falls apart instantly because weaponry</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">has spread more slowly than we might</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.390" end="00:03:15.010" style="s2">have thought so you read nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:16.570" style="s2">theorists in the 50s and 60s they think</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.010" end="00:03:18.519" style="s2">a third world war might be coming quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.570" end="00:03:20.410" style="s2">soon they were wrong you read worries</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.519" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">about proliferation from the 80s and 90s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.410" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">they sound horrible I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:26.830" style="s2">been great North Korea no one&#39;s happy</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">about that but at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.830" end="00:03:30.580" style="s2">weapons have not been used so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.200" style="s2">something fundamental about the models</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.580" end="00:03:34.090" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand you can ask the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.200" end="00:03:36.310" style="s2">question why didn&#39;t al-qaeda hire a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.090" end="00:03:37.570" style="s2">bunch of Stooges to go into a Tyson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.310" end="00:03:39.459" style="s2">Corner shopping mall with submachine</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.570" end="00:03:43.150" style="s2">guns and just cause some terror that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.459" end="00:03:45.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen so the logic of choice of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.150" end="00:03:47.230" style="s2">wielding destructive power is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.340" end="00:03:49.150" style="s2">issues in social science we understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.230" end="00:03:51.160" style="s2">least well I would say and there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.150" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">perhaps some hope of salvation so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.160" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">not sure Pinker falls apart instantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:57.370" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t feel Pinker defended Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:03:59.830" style="s2">very well and on my blog marginal</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.370" end="00:04:01.390" style="s2">revolution I did review his book and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.830" end="00:04:02.769" style="s2">worry is that there&#39;s an observational</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.390" end="00:04:04.840" style="s2">equivalence with how you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.769" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">data so you could say well deaths in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.840" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">wars have been going down will continue</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">to fall that&#39;s possibly true but another</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.489" style="s2">model is the more destructive the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:14.410" style="s2">weapons are the less frequent the wars</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.489" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">things will seem great for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.410" end="00:04:19.450" style="s2">but the next war when it comes will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:22.539" style="s2">quite a doozy so in some sense this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.450" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">the Great Moderation which last time was</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.539" end="00:04:25.870" style="s2">about market volatility and here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:26.920" style="s2">about the volatility of human violence</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.870" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">in gray</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.920" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">moderations maybe contain the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:32.770" style="s2">their own destruction well again I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:34.450" style="s2">want to be cautious there because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.770" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">don&#39;t understand destructive decisions</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.450" end="00:04:38.890" style="s2">very well like why did Hitler invade</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.930" style="s2">Russia we know a lot about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.890" end="00:04:45.130" style="s2">documented sense but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.930" end="00:04:47.350" style="s2">understood very well agreed and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.130" end="00:04:49.270" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know why so few reservoirs</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.350" end="00:04:53.290" style="s2">have been poisoned yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.270" end="00:04:55.330" style="s2">relatively low-tech options and it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.290" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">Las Vegas shooting for example showed</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.330" end="00:05:02.980" style="s2">what a small level of innovation in mass</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">killing can do to really amp the body</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.980" end="00:05:08.710" style="s2">can if that&#39;s what somebody is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:11.650" style="s2">optimize so I think that there is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.710" end="00:05:14.380" style="s2">mystery but I don&#39;t think that Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.650" end="00:05:17.310" style="s2">from what I understand of his basis for</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.380" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">optimism is really getting at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.310" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">people who listen to this podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:24.730" style="s2">have heard me elsewhere have heard me</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:26.980" style="s2">complain that it&#39;s as if he&#39;s neglecting</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.730" end="00:05:29.740" style="s2">a potential energy term but for violence</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.980" end="00:05:31.660" style="s2">and so the realized violence as you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.740" end="00:05:34.300" style="s2">pointing out has gone down but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.660" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">potential for violence is enormous and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.300" end="00:05:41.020" style="s2">as the cost Falls the access to violence</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">of this particular nature seems to put</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.020" end="00:05:46.570" style="s2">it into far too many within reach of far</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">too many hands one of our saving graces</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.570" end="00:05:50.590" style="s2">could be that the contagion effects for</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.020" end="00:08:12.790" style="s2">was an attempt to innovate well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.050" end="00:08:15.070" style="s2">could we could we go there I&#39;ve talked</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.630" end="00:09:08.150" style="s2">deliberately theatrical and artistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.810" end="00:09:10.790" style="s2">most likely it was as I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.150" end="00:09:13.250" style="s2">and if you look at the targets chosen</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.790" end="00:09:15.830" style="s2">the World Trade Center was not actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.250" end="00:09:17.840" style="s2">that economically important it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.830" end="00:09:19.610" style="s2">was not politically important but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.840" end="00:09:21.590" style="s2">were the tallest structures there is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.610" end="00:09:25.880" style="s2">theory they would collapse in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.590" end="00:09:28.100" style="s2">way and it seems they did they did so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.880" end="00:09:31.670" style="s2">does seem artistically motivated in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.100" end="00:09:34.070" style="s2">sense and there is this odd obsession of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.670" end="00:09:36.350" style="s2">many dictators with the arts which i</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.070" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">think is also poorly understood but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.350" end="00:09:41.710" style="s2">also gets at the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">totalitarian and violent impulses in US</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.710" end="00:09:47.720" style="s2">can be severed from innovation but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:49.780" style="s2">necessarily have to be yeah you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.720" end="00:09:52.520" style="s2">passion inside of the passion play</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.780" end="00:09:55.640" style="s2">anything that can truly excite the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.520" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">spirit could easily be weaponized so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.640" end="00:09:59.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which I guess I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:02.330" style="s2">expect the dictators would be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.690" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">animated by by the theater in particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.330" end="00:10:08.090" style="s2">but I think mass opinion in general</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">tends to neuter some of that desire for</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.090" end="00:10:12.260" style="s2">artistic creativity so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:15.800" style="s2">passion plays around the world if you go</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.260" end="00:10:18.860" style="s2">see one say during Easter in Mexico they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.800" end="00:10:20.690" style="s2">become something quite celebratory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.860" end="00:10:22.400" style="s2">for family and for friends and people</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.690" end="00:10:25.160" style="s2">get together people drink people cook</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.400" end="00:10:28.130" style="s2">special dishes so it&#39;s drained of so</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.160" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">much of the actual passion story and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.130" end="00:10:34.070" style="s2">becomes among other things less</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:37.250" style="s2">passionate so it&#39;s hard to sustain the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:39.020" style="s2">emotional violence behind the innovation</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.250" end="00:10:41.060" style="s2">of violence and that may be another one</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.020" end="00:10:42.830" style="s2">of our saving graces and you see this</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.060" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">with suicide bombers when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.830" end="00:10:47.090" style="s2">removed from their environments where</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:48.470" style="s2">they&#39;ve been indoctrinated it can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.090" end="00:10:50.210" style="s2">quite hard to get them to go through</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.470" end="00:10:51.710" style="s2">with what they&#39;ve been told to do and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.210" end="00:10:53.420" style="s2">sometimes you get them to go through</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.710" end="00:10:56.510" style="s2">with it by not even telling them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.420" end="00:10:58.490" style="s2">going to die hmm I&#39;ve read some accounts</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.490" end="00:11:04.400" style="s2">a lot of the 9/11 terrorists they didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.400" end="00:11:09.710" style="s2">that ambiguity I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.020" end="00:11:11.960" style="s2">presumably everybody signs up with an</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.710" end="00:11:14.180" style="s2">idea that martyrdom is part of the</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:38.710" style="s2">is a big deal because those news</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.330" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">I think the short term in the medium</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">but I think say four or five years later</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.090" end="00:16:14.200" style="s2">there&#39;ll be some new set of tools maybe</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:28.810" style="s2">not at all opposed to people say who run</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">more power to them but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.730" end="00:16:38.290" style="s2">we should not infer too much from the</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.690" end="00:17:12.760" style="s2">space I can find only private space on</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.649" end="00:20:15.669" style="s2">plaguing me for many things we used to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.559" end="00:20:18.730" style="s2">think that TV was the idiot box and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.669" end="00:20:21.340" style="s2">clearly just didn&#39;t understand long-form</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.820" end="00:20:43.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s the elites who are</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.720" end="00:20:47.999" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the voters there are plenty</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.940" end="00:20:51.309" style="s2">of candidates on the Democratic side</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.999" end="00:20:52.989" style="s2">some of them are quite smart you may or</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.429" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">small they have gotten media exposure I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.980" end="00:21:18.389" style="s2">know Andrew yang is sometimes kept out</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:21.100" style="s2">of the CNN graphics and so and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.389" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">in and of itself hysterically funny as</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.789" style="s2">no one will be able to discuss this</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.779" end="00:21:30.389" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have a lively internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.789" end="00:21:33.159" style="s2">but the people who manipulate emotions</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.389" end="00:21:35.169" style="s2">right are more likely to be the</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.859" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">huh and that I don&#39;t blame on the elites</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.590" end="00:21:42.759" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying the elites are blameless</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:45.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s mostly the voters do you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.759" end="00:21:46.869" style="s2">Frank Luntz well I&#39;ve met him and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.340" end="00:21:48.429" style="s2">heard him talk I wouldn&#39;t say I know him</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.429" end="00:21:52.029" style="s2">he&#39;s very smart too I went to college</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:55.359" style="s2">with him and for those who don&#39;t know he</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.029" end="00:21:59.019" style="s2">was a Republican pollster who pioneered</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.359" end="00:22:01.389" style="s2">the use of particular phraseology for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.019" end="00:22:03.070" style="s2">common concept any more or less</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.389" end="00:22:06.789" style="s2">discovered that we don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.070" end="00:22:09.279" style="s2">opinions about underlying law or facts</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.789" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">or theory but we have huge lead</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.279" end="00:22:16.660" style="s2">divergent opinions off based on how the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:20.919" style="s2">same underlying stuff is presented to us</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.660" end="00:22:23.740" style="s2">that death taxes and estate taxes may be</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.919" end="00:22:26.380" style="s2">the same thing but we oppose the death</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.740" end="00:22:29.620" style="s2">tax and we&#39;re for the estate tax do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.380" end="00:22:33.970" style="s2">believe that this level of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.620" end="00:22:36.660" style="s2">manipulation would go away if we started</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.970" end="00:22:39.040" style="s2">getting tools with which to discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.660" end="00:22:40.990" style="s2">clearly that kind of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.040" end="00:22:43.179" style="s2">manipulation is higher in some countries</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.990" end="00:22:44.919" style="s2">than in others so it&#39;s impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.179" end="00:22:47.559" style="s2">lead to believe at some fixed eternal</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.919" end="00:22:49.540" style="s2">constant but the United States has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.559" end="00:22:52.630" style="s2">long history of emotional and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.540" end="00:22:54.520" style="s2">populist politics in the 80s and 90s I</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.630" end="00:22:55.780" style="s2">view as an outlier kind of era where</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.520" end="00:22:57.429" style="s2">things were relatively calm and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.780" end="00:22:58.600" style="s2">reasonable even though at the time it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.429" end="00:22:59.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t always feel that way you feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.600" end="00:23:01.630" style="s2">that way to me at all compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.890" end="00:23:03.190" style="s2">mid to late 19th century my goodness</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.630" end="00:23:05.740" style="s2">right yeah then you had people in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.190" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">Congress attacking each other a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.740" end="00:23:11.410" style="s2">partisan media a lot of that right line</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:14.830" style="s2">so I don&#39;t see America becoming like</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.410" end="00:23:17.049" style="s2">Switzerland any time soon but clearly</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.830" end="00:23:18.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not impossible well I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.049" end="00:23:21.460" style="s2">the things that really strikes me about</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.910" end="00:23:25.990" style="s2">that is that the Liat waters and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.460" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">Frank Luntz is who put a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.990" end="00:23:30.309" style="s2">deliberate spin on this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:32.860" style="s2">mean-spirited emotional manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.309" end="00:23:34.929" style="s2">we&#39;re surprised that it didn&#39;t behave</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.860" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">let&#39;s say like rugby where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.929" end="00:23:40.030" style="s2">bunch of gentlemen take the field play</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:42.429" style="s2">absolutely brutally with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.030" end="00:23:45.250" style="s2">then going back going back to being</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.429" end="00:23:48.100" style="s2">gentlemen when the game is over Frank</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:51.910" style="s2">Luntz has told me that he just hates the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.100" end="00:23:53.500" style="s2">current state state of our politics that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.910" end="00:23:56.410" style="s2">it&#39;s far too mean-spirited and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.500" end="00:24:02.710" style="s2">destructive and he can&#39;t locate anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.410" end="00:24:04.750" style="s2">that he&#39;s done to kick this this listen</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.710" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">to high gear it&#39;s a very strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.750" end="00:24:09.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a disconnection between working</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:12.460" style="s2">on these campaigns in a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.460" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">scientific fashion to use people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.460" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">passions to sort of take over their</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:19.450" style="s2">decision-making and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.650" end="00:24:22.630" style="s2">inability to understand well how did we</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.450" end="00:24:25.000" style="s2">all become so uncivil I wonder if one of</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.990" end="00:24:35.470" style="s2">at something like the Manhattan Project</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:52.030" style="s2">the outlier the turning point for me is</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.030" end="00:26:57.100" style="s2">you have trumpism a series of very</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:09.880" style="s2">as 2001 do you see anything for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.050" end="00:27:14.200" style="s2">that&#39;s to me</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:04.310" style="s2">that the FBI had a dirty tricks</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.820" end="00:32:07.880" style="s2">department that actually fed</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:28.130" style="s2">as a fact that the CIA supported</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.130" end="00:32:31.730" style="s2">of painting yes because they thought it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:34.340" style="s2">would neutralize propagandistic art and</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.460" end="00:32:40.970" style="s2">got into a much more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.840" end="00:32:43.550" style="s2">discussion with an economist not too</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.970" end="00:32:47.240" style="s2">long ago who was looking at my work in</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.550" end="00:32:49.300" style="s2">economics and said Eric the person said</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.240" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">to me Eric I can&#39;t stand to see you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.300" end="00:32:55.340" style="s2">fighting the Chicago School of Economics</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:57.710" style="s2">do you are you aware that this was</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.340" end="00:33:00.170" style="s2">really just a bulwark against</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.710" end="00:33:02.360" style="s2">totalitarian communism rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.170" end="00:33:04.130" style="s2">theory that was intended to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.360" end="00:33:06.410" style="s2">operational and descriptive with</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.130" end="00:33:08.990" style="s2">predictive power and that now that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.410" end="00:33:10.400" style="s2">Cold War is over the problem is we</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.990" end="00:33:13.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t tell the children that it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.400" end="00:33:16.250" style="s2">really a political project rather than</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.220" end="00:33:17.860" style="s2">an analytic one but I mean I know or</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.250" end="00:33:19.320" style="s2">knew most of those people they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.860" end="00:33:21.450" style="s2">economists what</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.320" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">said they believed was true they had</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.450" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">careerist concerns they wanted to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:27.660" style="s2">the world a better place that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:31.020" style="s2">the best theory of the Chicago School of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.660" end="00:33:32.580" style="s2">Economics well I don&#39;t know I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.020" end="00:33:34.890" style="s2">know that there&#39;s this very funny</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.580" end="00:33:38.340" style="s2">paradigm which I call earns as an ex</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.890" end="00:33:40.590" style="s2">spends as a why and you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.340" end="00:33:44.460" style="s2">in physics I would say that Edward</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.590" end="00:33:46.850" style="s2">Witten has earned as a geometers</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.460" end="00:33:49.620" style="s2">but he&#39;s spent as a string theorist okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.850" end="00:33:51.210" style="s2">in economics I would say Milton Friedman</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:54.530" style="s2">earned as an economist he was a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.210" end="00:33:58.290" style="s2">fine connoisseur and he spent as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.530" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">political theorist and that in part this</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.290" end="00:34:04.290" style="s2">game of earning in one place and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:06.450" style="s2">spending somewhere else is depending</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.290" end="00:34:08.910" style="s2">upon how you view the history of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.450" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">subject it can be far more important to</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.910" end="00:34:13.080" style="s2">the participants how they spend rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:16.500" style="s2">than how they earn their credibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.080" end="00:34:18.420" style="s2">sure look Friedman made some mistakes so</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:20.820" style="s2">he thought that educational vouchers</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.420" end="00:34:22.920" style="s2">would work easily and simply and be</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.820" end="00:34:25.320" style="s2">quite popular that hasn&#39;t turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.920" end="00:34:27.030" style="s2">be the case he was more optimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.320" end="00:34:28.830" style="s2">shock therapy than he should have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.030" end="00:34:31.020" style="s2">though I would say on the whole shock</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.830" end="00:34:33.720" style="s2">therapy has done well on average look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.020" end="00:34:38.970" style="s2">Poland right Poland is a successful</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.720" end="00:34:41.100" style="s2">fairly free economy but what explains</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.970" end="00:34:43.020" style="s2">that I think is just simply that Milton</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.100" end="00:34:45.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t see the future course of world</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.020" end="00:34:46.860" style="s2">history and he was imperfect and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.120" end="00:34:49.410" style="s2">too optimistic about some of his own</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.860" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">ideas and you&#39;ll hear all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.410" end="00:34:53.640" style="s2">accounts about the Chicago the Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:55.320" style="s2">boys and conspiracy or the Habsburg</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.320" end="00:35:00.900" style="s2">LaRouche okay where the CIA funded them</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.570" end="00:35:02.580" style="s2">in Chile or whatever I don&#39;t feel those</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.900" end="00:35:04.440" style="s2">are the correct deep historical</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.090" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">were wrong a lot of them turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:14.970" style="s2">be really quite correct their overall</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:17.880" style="s2">record is pretty good that superficial</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.970" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">account I think is fundamentally true so</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.880" end="00:35:22.050" style="s2">now that we&#39;ve somehow found the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.460" end="00:35:23.970" style="s2">economics after burning through some</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.050" end="00:35:26.100" style="s2">other stuff we were never out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.970" end="00:35:27.600" style="s2">economics okay please continue all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.100" end="00:35:28.770" style="s2">well that&#39;s the problem is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.600" end="00:35:31.510" style="s2">never it&#39;s like you can&#39;t leave</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.510" end="00:35:37.300" style="s2">can we talk and again let&#39;s feel free to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.230" end="00:35:39.400" style="s2">turn any question around on me although</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.300" end="00:35:42.099" style="s2">I&#39;m not an economist</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.400" end="00:35:45.730" style="s2">what I find astounding about the field</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.099" end="00:35:48.359" style="s2">of economics is that on the one hand I</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.730" end="00:35:51.310" style="s2">can&#39;t get enough of it I need to use its</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.359" end="00:35:54.430" style="s2">concepts its terminology some of its</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.310" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">models and on the other hand I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.430" end="00:35:59.230" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolute abomination that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:01.060" style="s2">been not it&#39;s not that the field is</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.230" end="00:36:02.740" style="s2">broken so much is that the field is</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.060" end="00:36:04.119" style="s2">fixed in the same sense that the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.740" end="00:36:06.190" style="s2">series can be fixed</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.119" end="00:36:09.760" style="s2">and I find that whenever I go into</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.190" end="00:36:12.339" style="s2">economics there&#39;s this sort of mountain</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.760" end="00:36:14.980" style="s2">Bailey type approach where there&#39;s this</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.810" end="00:36:24.430" style="s2">absolutely tortured just so story that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.940" end="00:36:28.030" style="s2">we tell that almost always seems to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.430" end="00:36:30.790" style="s2">flatter institutions and power and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.030" end="00:36:32.940" style="s2">the structures that would be upended if</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.790" end="00:36:36.220" style="s2">we actually just let the field run and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.940" end="00:36:38.950" style="s2">we&#39;ll reach the conclusions that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.220" end="00:36:41.290" style="s2">merge from the models it may depend on</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.950" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">what exactly you&#39;re being upset by but</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.290" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">keep in mind at least in the West what</p>

<p begin="00:36:52.780" end="00:36:56.650" style="s2">and in economics if our just-so stories</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">are fairly positive toward those</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.900" end="00:37:49.950" style="s2">criticisms of the NSF virtually</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.940" end="00:37:52.910" style="s2">impossible okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.950" end="00:37:55.290" style="s2">so here&#39;s an interesting question to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.910" end="00:37:58.470" style="s2">economists have been very comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.290" end="00:38:01.830" style="s2">turning the lens of economic theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.470" end="00:38:04.770" style="s2">on absolutely any group save one they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.830" end="00:38:09.480" style="s2">do priests they&#39;ll do it to scientists</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.770" end="00:38:12.540" style="s2">to politicians they cannot imagine I</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.480" end="00:38:14.250" style="s2">mean that this is going to escape notice</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.540" end="00:38:17.580" style="s2">forever my wife has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.250" end="00:38:20.280" style="s2">economics squared what is the political</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.580" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">economy of economists themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.280" end="00:38:25.230" style="s2">where are these papers now you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.050" end="00:38:27.540" style="s2">find it interesting particularly that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.230" end="00:38:29.340" style="s2">this field doesn&#39;t exist I think they do</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.540" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">it now on Twitter so they accuse each</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.340" end="00:38:34.620" style="s2">other of having bad motives or being</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:37.290" style="s2">captive of their funders so with social</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.620" end="00:38:39.300" style="s2">media you&#39;re seeing a blossoming of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.290" end="00:38:41.490" style="s2">kind of attack there are still</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.300" end="00:38:43.350" style="s2">criticisms I don&#39;t like being made so</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.490" end="00:38:45.150" style="s2">there&#39;s the partisan criticism of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.350" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">who disagree with you but to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.150" end="00:38:49.050" style="s2">criticized Chinese graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.450" style="s2">because they can&#39;t speak their mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.050" end="00:38:53.100" style="s2">about issues related to China because</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.450" end="00:38:55.110" style="s2">they fear for their own careers or for</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.100" end="00:38:57.480" style="s2">their family members back in China that</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.110" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">somehow not acceptable to raise even as</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.480" end="00:39:01.830" style="s2">an issue so I do think there are big</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.930" style="s2">blind spots but just like attacking the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.830" end="00:39:06.090" style="s2">other person is now pretty common</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.930" end="00:39:09.600" style="s2">typically done in a not very clever</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.090" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">sophisticated way okay but we let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.600" end="00:39:14.010" style="s2">about making it clever or more</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:16.080" style="s2">sophisticated if you were going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.010" end="00:39:18.660" style="s2">the lens of economics and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.080" end="00:39:21.720" style="s2">the analysis of political economy on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.660" end="00:39:24.150" style="s2">profession of economics what would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.720" end="00:39:26.730" style="s2">the assuming that there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.150" end="00:39:27.960" style="s2">Pareto curve here sure for the first ten</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.730" end="00:39:31.260" style="s2">percent of my effort I should get</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.960" end="00:39:34.590" style="s2">something like seventy percent of the of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.260" end="00:39:38.340" style="s2">the bang what would be the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.590" end="00:39:40.380" style="s2">to do in economic theory using economic</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.340" end="00:39:42.450" style="s2">theory against economists themselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.380" end="00:39:44.670" style="s2">well you use the subjunctive but I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.450" end="00:39:46.890" style="s2">in fact written this the biggest problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.670" end="00:39:49.230" style="s2">is people over specialize and right</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.890" end="00:39:51.630" style="s2">narrow defensible papers to be published</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.230" end="00:39:53.310" style="s2">that are invulnerable to peer criticism</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.630" end="00:39:55.260" style="s2">but don&#39;t amount to very much and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.310" end="00:39:57.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a massive waste of human labor</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.260" end="00:39:58.920" style="s2">and people do not direct their energy</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.360" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">energies toward actually solving</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.920" end="00:40:01.320" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:03.390" style="s2">answering questions not to me is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.320" end="00:40:05.790" style="s2">criticism number one I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.390" end="00:40:08.580" style="s2">absolutely correct it concerns me</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.790" end="00:40:11.250" style="s2">greatly a small number of people have</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.580" end="00:40:12.510" style="s2">voiced this that&#39;s sort of a if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.250" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">understood it correctly and perhaps I</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.510" end="00:40:16.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t that&#39;s a little bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:18.360" style="s2">opportunity cost that we could have done</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.020" end="00:40:20.460" style="s2">a lot more and instead we settled for</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.360" end="00:40:21.780" style="s2">something that wasn&#39;t or maybe those</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.460" end="00:40:23.340" style="s2">people should just not be doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.780" end="00:40:25.170" style="s2">economics they&#39;re talented people they</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.340" end="00:40:28.470" style="s2">could just you know build bricks</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.170" end="00:40:29.880" style="s2">whatever true but if I think about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.470" end="00:40:33.120" style="s2">really moved the needle in medicine</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.880" end="00:40:36.780" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the whole concept of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.120" end="00:40:41.490" style="s2">iatrogenic harm which is you know harm</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.780" end="00:40:43.140" style="s2">done by healers really focused us on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.490" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">idea that certain hospitals kill more</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.140" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">people than others</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:52.080" style="s2">what about ikana genic harm it depends</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:53.610" style="s2">at whom you point the finger but if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.080" end="00:40:56.130" style="s2">look at what is sometimes called the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.610" end="00:40:58.020" style="s2">Washington Consensus which is not of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.130" end="00:41:00.330" style="s2">I completely agree with by any means but</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.020" end="00:41:02.370" style="s2">it&#39;s called the Washington Consensus for</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.330" end="00:41:04.860" style="s2">a reason there&#39;s a recent paper by Bill</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.370" end="00:41:06.750" style="s2">easterly that goes through and argues</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.860" end="00:41:08.850" style="s2">correctly I think that uh Navarrete the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.750" end="00:41:11.820" style="s2">Washington Consensus has done more good</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.850" end="00:41:13.350" style="s2">than harm so the idea that economics is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.820" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">some great scandal that we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.350" end="00:41:17.070" style="s2">around wrecking things Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:19.380" style="s2">Applebaum argues this in his recent book</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.070" end="00:41:22.230" style="s2">I like that book I think it&#39;s small</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.380" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">right but I think it is more wrong than</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.230" end="00:41:27.600" style="s2">right and it&#39;s overlooking the many</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:30.090" style="s2">cases where economic advice has done</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.600" end="00:41:32.550" style="s2">well I mentioned Poland before but Czech</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.090" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">Republic Slovakia you look at Chile</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.550" end="00:41:37.140" style="s2">which has been democratic since 1990</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:39.360" style="s2">economic inequality in Chile has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.140" end="00:41:41.670" style="s2">falling for some period of time the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.360" end="00:41:43.830" style="s2">country started from sky-high rates and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.670" end="00:41:45.180" style="s2">it has fallen somewhat it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.830" end="00:41:47.490" style="s2">middle of the Latin American</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.180" end="00:41:49.230" style="s2">distribution but it&#39;s fallen and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.490" end="00:41:51.600" style="s2">country as the highest real wages in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.230" end="00:41:54.300" style="s2">Latin America by some amount it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.600" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">miracle it&#39;s not perfect economists gave</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.300" end="00:42:00.360" style="s2">some bad advice there but overall they</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:02.610" style="s2">did much more good than harm see this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.360" end="00:42:05.790" style="s2">the thing that I I&#39;m very confused by I</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.610" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">understand let me just say that I cede</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.790" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">that even though economists may do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:18.930" style="s2">of harm prettified as doing pure good</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:21.120" style="s2">that that&#39;s not the criticism that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.930" end="00:42:23.400" style="s2">would really level first at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.120" end="00:42:26.550" style="s2">profession it&#39;s really something closer</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.400" end="00:42:29.790" style="s2">to academic malpractice where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.550" end="00:42:32.820" style="s2">economists know the truth the right way</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.790" end="00:42:37.190" style="s2">to set up the problem and choose not</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.820" end="00:42:41.090" style="s2">only not to do that in public but to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.190" end="00:42:43.470" style="s2">demonize to exclude to blackballed</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.090" end="00:42:45.360" style="s2">anyone who would make the correct</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.470" end="00:42:46.860" style="s2">critique in other words they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.360" end="00:42:52.260" style="s2">the right way to set up the problem we</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.860" end="00:42:54.210" style="s2">don&#39;t we&#39;re too stupid what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.260" end="00:42:56.250" style="s2">problem we should be setting up let me</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.210" end="00:42:59.190" style="s2">give the the the the example that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.250" end="00:43:00.840" style="s2">perhaps know I know a small number are</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.190" end="00:43:02.790" style="s2">we gonna get to gauge theory now you</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.840" end="00:43:04.080" style="s2">want to well first make your point but</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.790" end="00:43:05.580" style="s2">at some point we need to get to gauge</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.080" end="00:43:07.560" style="s2">theory because I need you to for a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.580" end="00:43:09.360" style="s2">little of each I&#39;ll change one I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.560" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">the gauge I&#39;ll do a gauge Theory example</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.360" end="00:43:12.510" style="s2">but that&#39;s complicated do your other</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:19.050" style="s2">simpler point then we&#39;ll do gauge Theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.510" end="00:43:23.400" style="s2">well I could do the Great Moderation I</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.050" end="00:43:26.190" style="s2">could do stem labor and I could do CPI</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.400" end="00:43:29.540" style="s2">these are things I&#39;ve I&#39;ve engaged with</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.190" end="00:43:33.300" style="s2">if I did the CPI one that&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.540" end="00:43:37.590" style="s2">you have a small number of economists</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.300" end="00:43:41.640" style="s2">who in the mid-90s became directed by</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.590" end="00:43:45.270" style="s2">Bob Packwood and Daniel Moynihan to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.640" end="00:43:47.600" style="s2">an overstatement of the CPI because tax</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.270" end="00:43:50.580" style="s2">brackets were indexed right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.600" end="00:43:52.470" style="s2">entitlement benefits Social Security</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.580" end="00:43:55.500" style="s2">Medicare were indexed and so what they</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.470" end="00:43:57.510" style="s2">found is if you could knock down the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.500" end="00:44:01.140" style="s2">measurement of the CPI you could raise</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.510" end="00:44:05.490" style="s2">taxes and slash benefits and they backed</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.140" end="00:44:08.340" style="s2">out that 1.1 percent overstatement</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.490" end="00:44:10.980" style="s2">if corrected would lead to a trillion</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.340" end="00:44:13.320" style="s2">dollar savings over ten years and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.980" end="00:44:14.850" style="s2">actually broke into two groups to come</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.320" end="00:44:18.390" style="s2">up with two separate numbers that would</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.850" end="00:44:20.250" style="s2">add together to 1.1 which to me is</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.390" end="00:44:23.070" style="s2">academic malpractice that is they</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.250" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">started with the target and this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.070" end="00:44:26.820" style="s2">according to one of their own members of</p>

<p begin="00:46:36.180" end="00:46:40.440" style="s2">to dismiss out of hand but I&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.150" style="s2">there are multiple checks on this broad</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.440" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">do they fit in with our other I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.150" end="00:46:45.330" style="s2">we&#39;re in two different layers of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:48.900" style="s2">discussion which is fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.330" end="00:46:51.870" style="s2">one layer the discussion is did they</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.900" end="00:46:53.730" style="s2">point out some good things about ways in</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.870" end="00:46:56.370" style="s2">which the CPI could be done better they</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.730" end="00:46:59.190" style="s2">did and did they do some work they</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.370" end="00:47:03.600" style="s2">absolutely did did they commit academic</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.190" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">malpractice absolutely motherfucking yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.600" end="00:47:07.950" style="s2">they committed academic malpractice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:09.780" style="s2">not in the same layer of the stack Tyler</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.950" end="00:47:12.120" style="s2">to me it is your objection just the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.780" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">process so I don&#39;t doubt yeah bad things</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.120" end="00:47:15.380" style="s2">went on in those rooms I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:17.940" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.380" end="00:47:20.520" style="s2">well they destroyed my wife&#39;s career</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.940" end="00:47:23.310" style="s2">over it as my opinion they went into</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.520" end="00:47:25.950" style="s2">something called the Harvard jobs market</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:52.140" style="s2">on the podcast so there was a guy named</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.370" end="00:49:54.780" style="s2">Irving Fisher who you can look up who</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.140" end="00:49:59.130" style="s2">came up with lots of axioms to find the</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.130" end="00:50:02.780" style="s2">Frisch came up with an impossibility</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.590" end="00:50:14.250" style="s2">me ask you about gauge theory for before</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:21.660" style="s2">shot let&#39;s say gauge theory is correct</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.350" end="00:50:23.250" style="s2">is the actual rate of inflation higher</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.660" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">or lower than what we&#39;re measuring you</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:32.100" style="s2">wrong object there&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.270" end="00:50:34.820" style="s2">would create which you might so if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.100" end="00:50:38.010" style="s2">previously use these mechanical posh and</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">were all so focused on the early 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.410" end="00:58:21.170" style="s2">as a real and mysterious discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:24.289" style="s2">with respect to growth and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.170" end="00:58:26.390" style="s2">the biggest puzzles so 1973 comes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.289" end="00:58:29.029" style="s2">of indicators crash you can say fine the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.390" end="00:58:30.739" style="s2">higher price of oil that&#39;s great but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.029" end="00:58:32.859" style="s2">higher price of oil goes away and those</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.739" end="00:58:37.369" style="s2">indicators do not come back very well</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.859" end="00:58:39.049" style="s2">what do you think okay first of all</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.369" end="00:58:40.969" style="s2">let&#39;s just do this slowly sure is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.049" end="00:58:44.180" style="s2">mysterious that more people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.969" end="00:58:46.849" style="s2">focused on what happens around 1972 to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.180" end="00:58:48.650" style="s2">74 of course 10% of the profession</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.849" end="00:58:50.209" style="s2">should be working on that instead people</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.650" end="00:58:52.009" style="s2">are doing these little narrow things to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.209" end="00:58:53.779" style="s2">publish but it&#39;s hard to get a clear</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.009" end="00:58:55.670" style="s2">answer to the question we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.779" end="00:58:58.190" style="s2">so no one can publish on it the referees</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.670" end="00:59:00.019" style="s2">will shoot down whatever you turn in I</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.190" end="00:59:01.279" style="s2">would rather see people just write and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.019" end="00:59:03.799" style="s2">speculate on the more important</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.279" end="00:59:06.440" style="s2">questions but if you ask what do I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.799" end="00:59:08.319" style="s2">happened clearly oil was a major factor</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.440" end="00:59:11.059" style="s2">let me give you just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.319" end="00:59:13.819" style="s2">your do what you can&#39;t do but I can yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.059" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">I think my favorite version of the graph</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.819" end="00:59:20.539" style="s2">that shows how violent this change was</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:24.499" style="s2">is something that you focused us on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.539" end="00:59:26.239" style="s2">not perfect but it&#39;s measured GDP</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.499" end="00:59:29.209" style="s2">whatever the failures we have of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.239" end="00:59:32.749" style="s2">measure together with measured male</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.209" end="00:59:36.709" style="s2">median income yes and those two things</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.749" end="00:59:40.430" style="s2">are going up in lockstep before 1973 or</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.709" end="00:59:41.630" style="s2">so and then one of them flatlines and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.430" end="00:59:44.059" style="s2">the other keeps going up</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.630" end="00:59:47.299" style="s2">does that graph something that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.059" end="00:59:49.489" style="s2">developed I presented it obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.299" end="00:59:50.959" style="s2">numbers come from other people I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.489" end="00:59:53.660" style="s2">a lot to draw attention to it but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.959" end="00:59:54.910" style="s2">don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s original with me well</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.660" end="00:59:58.000" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I think was a great</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.910" end="01:00:02.140" style="s2">observation that that graph was so clean</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.000" end="01:00:03.910" style="s2">that it caused people to stop denying</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.140" end="01:00:06.040" style="s2">that something happened her and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.910" end="01:00:07.480" style="s2">they almost immediately in my experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.040" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">and correct me if the if yours is</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.480" end="01:00:12.490" style="s2">different they go from not believing</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:14.200" style="s2">that something really big happened to</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.490" end="01:00:15.880" style="s2">immediately telling you exactly what it</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.200" end="01:00:17.260" style="s2">was that happened that explains it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.880" end="01:00:19.810" style="s2">they&#39;re rich people stole at all or</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.260" end="01:00:21.460" style="s2">something yeah or it&#39;s all about Bretton</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.810" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">Woods or it&#39;s all just about the oil</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.460" end="01:00:25.740" style="s2">shock but I think the missing variable</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:29.560" style="s2">once you get through oil prices</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.740" end="01:00:31.300" style="s2">over-regulation a number of factors that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.560" end="01:00:33.400" style="s2">people have already discussed but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.300" end="01:00:36.280" style="s2">think the increasing feminization of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.400" end="01:00:38.760" style="s2">society is a missing factor in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.280" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">whole equation that norms have changed</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.760" end="01:00:43.210" style="s2">women as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.240" end="01:00:45.099" style="s2">or more risk-averse we&#39;re much less</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.210" end="01:00:47.560" style="s2">likely to fight a war in a more</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.099" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">feminized society so in my opinion this</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.560" end="01:00:54.180" style="s2">is very likely good on net but change is</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:56.230" style="s2">harder to accomplish in some ways and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.180" end="01:00:58.540" style="s2">people are more comfortable with higher</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.230" end="01:01:00.820" style="s2">levels of regulation and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.540" end="01:01:02.890" style="s2">things are there&#39;s pluses and minuses</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.820" end="01:01:06.820" style="s2">but it will slow down measured economic</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.890" end="01:01:10.990" style="s2">growth now can we talk about to use your</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.820" end="01:01:15.339" style="s2">term a feminized economy without in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.990" end="01:01:17.500" style="s2">public in a public sphere without having</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.339" end="01:01:20.230" style="s2">to celebrate everything that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.500" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">feminized and demonized everything that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.230" end="01:01:25.750" style="s2">was lost well it depends who the we is</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:29.260" style="s2">okay I do think one should consider</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.750" end="01:01:31.540" style="s2">costs and benefits and to a large extent</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.260" end="01:01:34.030" style="s2">men have accepted a more feminized</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.540" end="01:01:36.430" style="s2">society because it has very strong</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.030" end="01:01:38.320" style="s2">positives so I&#39;m completely sincere when</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.430" end="01:01:40.990" style="s2">I say on that I think it&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.320" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">so give me those experimental evidence</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.990" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">and portfolio evidence women are more</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:49.930" style="s2">risk-averse and as a norm my guess is</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:52.630" style="s2">not proven but my speculation is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.930" end="01:01:54.339" style="s2">really matters and it is in addition to</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.630" end="01:01:56.140" style="s2">other factors about productivity in</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.339" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">regulation and spending more in fighting</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.140" end="01:02:00.310" style="s2">pollution and oil prices and so on which</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:03.310" style="s2">are at this point more or less</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.310" end="01:02:06.190" style="s2">well-known and that&#39;s why I think the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.310" end="01:02:07.330" style="s2">slowdown has mostly persisted and I do</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.190" end="01:02:11.260" style="s2">think you will have extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.330" end="01:02:12.010" style="s2">periods like 1995 to 1998 when</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.260" end="01:02:13.870" style="s2">information to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.010" end="01:02:15.790" style="s2">nology to so many good things it</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.870" end="01:02:17.560" style="s2">overwhelms the negatives I think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.790" end="01:02:19.840" style="s2">have more of those so let&#39;s assume for</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.560" end="01:02:22.090" style="s2">the moment that both feminization of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.840" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">some kind has occurred right and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.090" end="01:02:26.590" style="s2">also just stipulate for this purpose</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s also net positive right up</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.590" end="01:02:32.290" style="s2">until the present let&#39;s imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:35.320" style="s2">going forward far fewer women choose or</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.290" end="01:02:37.720" style="s2">are able to form families and become</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.320" end="01:02:40.120" style="s2">mothers sure how does that change the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.720" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">equation potentially could that tip this</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.120" end="01:02:45.400" style="s2">increased level of feminization negative</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:47.620" style="s2">well could it even now forgetting about</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.400" end="01:02:50.830" style="s2">the speculation it&#39;s a significant gain</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.620" end="01:02:53.080" style="s2">for elite men and quite possibly a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.830" end="01:02:55.000" style="s2">negative for non elite men and you see</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.080" end="01:02:57.400" style="s2">that in the data very clearly due to</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.000" end="01:02:58.900" style="s2">marriage correct so marriage as an</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.400" end="01:03:01.270" style="s2">incentive is much weaker for some</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.900" end="01:03:05.010" style="s2">subclass of men who seem to be fairly</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.270" end="01:03:07.750" style="s2">numerous religiosity seems to be down</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.010" end="01:03:10.240" style="s2">total fertility is down it&#39;s now I</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.750" end="01:03:14.140" style="s2">believe it about 1.8 it used to be a 2.2</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.240" end="01:03:16.600" style="s2">and if you look at social indicators for</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.140" end="01:03:19.120" style="s2">a lot of men in the lower middle class</p>

<p begin="01:05:59.510" end="01:06:04.580" style="s2">in many settings not just in economics I</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.850" end="01:06:06.410" style="s2">think actually economics is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.580" end="01:06:09.170" style="s2">better settings to be able to have such</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.410" end="01:06:11.810" style="s2">discussions there were two areas in</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.170" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">academia where you can still say things</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.810" end="01:06:15.530" style="s2">are either counterintuitive or possibly</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:17.990" style="s2">politically incorrect and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.530" end="01:06:19.880" style="s2">economics and philosophy and both are</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.990" end="01:06:23.000" style="s2">healthier for it so to me that</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.880" end="01:06:25.250" style="s2">evolutionary theory I know that area</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.000" end="01:06:29.000" style="s2">less well may well be true I would say</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.250" end="01:06:31.400" style="s2">that that&#39;s probably my I mean it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:06:31.400" end="01:06:36.890" style="s2">wrong but I do think that if you allow</p>

<p begin="01:06:36.890" end="01:06:41.460" style="s2">theory there is no subject</p>

<p begin="01:06:44.950" end="01:06:52.030" style="s2">it&#39;s so dated driven that results get</p>

<p begin="01:12:22.740" end="01:12:27.330" style="s2">far I&#39;m not yet optimistic that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.630" end="01:12:29.750" style="s2">get at the actual problem you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.330" end="01:12:31.470" style="s2">well we&#39;ll see in all fairness the</p>

<p begin="01:12:31.470" end="01:12:37.530" style="s2">correct to raise that I&#39;m on their side</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.340" end="01:12:39.480" style="s2">but at the same time we can&#39;t be naive</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.530" end="01:12:41.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to realize problems are</p>

<p begin="01:12:47.700" end="01:12:51.990" style="s2">so we&#39;ve referred to this podcast as</p>

<p begin="01:12:51.990" end="01:12:57.900" style="s2">effectively this is pirate radio for a</p>

<p begin="01:12:57.900" end="01:13:04.280" style="s2">economics for a couple of moves that</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.590" end="01:13:07.940" style="s2">seemed really nutty to me and I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.280" end="01:13:11.100" style="s2">the first one is that you turned down</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.940" end="01:13:12.630" style="s2">Harvard to go to George Mason as an</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.100" end="01:13:15.870" style="s2">undergraduate because you thought you</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.630" end="01:13:17.910" style="s2">could spend more time reading the grains</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.870" end="01:13:19.900" style="s2">that create works of economics as do I</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.910" end="01:13:22.750" style="s2">have my facts moral</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.900" end="01:13:24.850" style="s2">right I didn&#39;t apply to Harvard I had a</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.750" end="01:13:28.360" style="s2">very strong academic record oh and this</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.850" end="01:13:30.040" style="s2">was back in the late 1970s I&#39;m believe I</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.360" end="01:13:32.440" style="s2">could have gotten into many top schools</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.040" end="01:13:36.520" style="s2">though but I only applied to George</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.440" end="01:13:37.870" style="s2">Mason in fact okay so my high school</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.520" end="01:13:41.170" style="s2">guidance counselors thought I was crazy</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.870" end="01:13:43.780" style="s2">I had SATs you know the time and so on</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.170" end="01:13:45.370" style="s2">good grades but for me this was a</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.780" end="01:13:47.980" style="s2">version of homeschooling I was choosing</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.370" end="01:13:49.390" style="s2">homeschooling and most of all I hated</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.980" end="01:13:52.120" style="s2">the idea of living in a dorm I</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.390" end="01:13:54.310" style="s2">considered that so barbaric that is a 17</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.120" end="01:13:56.590" style="s2">year old I thought I want a life I want</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.310" end="01:13:58.690" style="s2">a car I want an apartment George Mason</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.590" end="01:14:00.790" style="s2">was a commuter school it had an</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.690" end="01:14:02.650" style="s2">interesting economics department but</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.790" end="01:14:05.890" style="s2">most of all I wanted my personal space</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.650" end="01:14:07.420" style="s2">an ability for classes not to be too</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.890" end="01:14:09.190" style="s2">hard or have too much homework and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.420" end="01:14:11.770" style="s2">would just work on my own like every day</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.190" end="01:14:14.260" style="s2">all day long morning through night and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.770" end="01:14:16.240" style="s2">did it was it a great decision well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.260" end="01:14:18.700" style="s2">not for me to say I don&#39;t regret it at</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.240" end="01:14:20.680" style="s2">all I&#39;m very happy I did it but you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.700" end="01:14:22.360" style="s2">great by what standard it could be a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.680" end="01:14:24.240" style="s2">of decisions you make ex-post you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.360" end="01:14:26.650" style="s2">glad you&#39;re turned out to be you and</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.240" end="01:14:28.870" style="s2">you&#39;ll endorse them but that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.650" end="01:14:31.030" style="s2">as informative as actually seeing the X</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.870" end="01:14:33.070" style="s2">on tape trade-off okay but then you you</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.030" end="01:14:35.310" style="s2">went to Harvard for grad school correct</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.070" end="01:14:38.590" style="s2">and it was necessary for me to get a job</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.310" end="01:14:40.630" style="s2">right and then a research job and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.590" end="01:14:42.490" style="s2">you came back to George Mason after a</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.630" end="01:14:46.440" style="s2">stint at UC Irvine that&#39;s correct okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.490" end="01:14:50.470" style="s2">and you start choosing to blog</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.440" end="01:14:52.960" style="s2">yes that&#39;s correct that was I think 2003</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.470" end="01:14:55.120" style="s2">though my memory could be off by okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.960" end="01:14:58.690" style="s2">now this puts you in a group with people</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.120" end="01:15:02.080" style="s2">like Peter White in physics who are</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.690" end="01:15:04.570" style="s2">starting to really upset standard acted</p>

<p begin="01:15:08.830" end="01:15:12.970" style="s2">had been thought to be the meritocracy</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.220" end="01:15:28.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I upset people at first it</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.260" end="01:15:30.550" style="s2">was not taken at all seriously so no one</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.390" end="01:15:32.230" style="s2">was upset and then it was very quick all</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.550" end="01:15:33.670" style="s2">of a sudden that it was taken very</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.230" end="01:15:35.199" style="s2">seriously and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.670" end="01:15:37.150" style="s2">people decided they needed to suck up to</p>

<p begin="01:15:37.150" end="01:15:40.870" style="s2">of an intermediate period or I fought</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.280" end="01:15:44.380" style="s2">some kind of war it goes opposite I</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.870" end="01:15:46.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand that so in general the</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.270" end="01:15:52.600" style="s2">cause people to want to get along with</p>

<p begin="01:15:57.730" end="01:16:01.270" style="s2">and that came suddenly and before that</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.650" end="01:16:03.250" style="s2">happened they just ignored me there was</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.270" end="01:16:05.110" style="s2">never much hostility that I&#39;m aware of</p>

<p begin="01:22:41.210" end="01:22:46.580" style="s2">thinkers are finally invited back in</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.420" end="01:22:48.620" style="s2">like I think you want to be invited the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.580" end="01:22:50.600" style="s2">Council on Foreign Relations they would</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.620" end="01:22:53.450" style="s2">bore the hell out of you not the way I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.600" end="01:22:54.860" style="s2">do it I don&#39;t know I mean I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.450" end="01:22:56.360" style="s2">they&#39;re fine they have a lot of smart</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.860" end="01:22:58.070" style="s2">people I know a lot of people that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.360" end="01:22:59.900" style="s2">like them very much I enjoy talking with</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.070" end="01:23:02.150" style="s2">them I&#39;ve never visited the place okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.900" end="01:23:04.160" style="s2">but as an institution yeah I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.150" end="01:23:06.560" style="s2">of them as changing anyone&#39;s mind on</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.160" end="01:23:08.630" style="s2">anything yeah and I don&#39;t mind no but</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.560" end="01:23:10.520" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what I think about like</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.630" end="01:23:12.650" style="s2">the National Academy of Sciences I went</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.520" end="01:23:14.990" style="s2">for a meeting at the National Academy</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.650" end="01:23:17.750" style="s2">and it&#39;s very clear that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.990" end="01:23:20.450" style="s2">used to really heterodox ideas of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.750" end="01:23:24.920" style="s2">certain level in anything like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.450" end="01:23:26.420" style="s2">volume that we had them and the problem</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.920" end="01:23:28.760" style="s2">that I so I have this thing I call the</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.420" end="01:23:31.340" style="s2">disc the distributed idea suppression</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.760" end="01:23:32.750" style="s2">complex yeah and it has to do and this</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.340" end="01:23:38.120" style="s2">has to do with our mutual friend Peter</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.750" end="01:23:40.820" style="s2">Thiel who has a related bizarre version</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.120" end="01:23:43.970" style="s2">of a common idea that that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.820" end="01:23:46.400" style="s2">a lot about his version is that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.970" end="01:23:48.920" style="s2">stagnation that he and I and you I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.400" end="01:23:50.960" style="s2">have all discussed is actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.920" end="01:23:54.440" style="s2">functional that it&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.960" end="01:23:56.020" style="s2">retard the spread of great ideas because</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.440" end="01:23:57.890" style="s2">in some sense they may be so</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.020" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">destabilizing to a fragile world</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.890" end="01:24:02.660" style="s2">fascinating idea it&#39;s a fascinating idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:05.960" style="s2">Peter I would say would be one of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.660" end="01:24:08.420" style="s2">smartest people of our age and again too</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.960" end="01:24:10.940" style="s2">often he&#39;s referred to us of like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.420" end="01:24:13.610" style="s2">I was weird yeah he&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.940" end="01:24:15.740" style="s2">quite good as an original creative</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.610" end="01:24:17.780" style="s2">generative thinker and as a judge of</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.740" end="01:24:19.190" style="s2">talent which are two related but</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.780" end="01:24:21.500" style="s2">separate things well it&#39;s like Peter</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.190" end="01:24:25.310" style="s2">could be the smartest person that I know</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.500" end="01:24:26.449" style="s2">well in part to make that argument what</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.310" end="01:24:29.840" style="s2">I would say is is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.449" end="01:24:32.630" style="s2">Peter does a better job figuring out who</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.840" end="01:24:35.989" style="s2">the generative heterodox thinkers are</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.630" end="01:24:38.869" style="s2">your objection notwithstanding to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.989" end="01:24:40.610" style="s2">term heterodox and then what he realizes</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.869" end="01:24:42.860" style="s2">very often is is that they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.610" end="01:24:44.059" style="s2">the the best way of putting forward</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.860" end="01:24:48.709" style="s2">their ideas</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.059" end="01:24:53.530" style="s2">he&#39;s also got another idea that</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.709" end="01:24:56.179" style="s2">academics don&#39;t understand which I call</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.530" end="01:24:58.940" style="s2">maximally compressed minimally distorted</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.179" end="01:25:00.769" style="s2">where he takes some idea and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.940" end="01:25:04.459" style="s2">willing to give up a tiny amount of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.769" end="01:25:07.039" style="s2">accuracy to make it extremely compact so</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.459" end="01:25:09.530" style="s2">that when unpacked it tells you a ton</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.039" end="01:25:12.320" style="s2">and because academics over focus on</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.530" end="01:25:14.449" style="s2">special cases he very often runs the</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.320" end="01:25:16.099" style="s2">table where somebody will object to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.449" end="01:25:18.619" style="s2">idea that his principal isn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.099" end="01:25:20.119" style="s2">accurate but it&#39;s thematically so</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.619" end="01:25:22.219" style="s2">accurate that the heuristic is just</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.119" end="01:25:24.289" style="s2">about over whelming power and of course</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.219" end="01:25:26.630" style="s2">he&#39;s used that to enrich himself quite</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.289" end="01:25:28.219" style="s2">considerably Patrick Collison may be the</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.630" end="01:25:30.709" style="s2">quickest learner but I would say this</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.219" end="01:25:32.539" style="s2">Eric enjoy your triumph so we live in</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.709" end="01:25:34.280" style="s2">this funny in-between world where the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.539" end="01:25:36.650" style="s2">old structures are all still there and</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.280" end="01:25:39.289" style="s2">we both have had the first half or so of</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.650" end="01:25:41.059" style="s2">our lives in only the old structures yes</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.289" end="01:25:43.130" style="s2">second half of our lives in the world of</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.059" end="01:25:45.590" style="s2">the internet we&#39;re the only generation</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.130" end="01:25:48.050" style="s2">that will be able to say is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.590" end="01:25:49.550" style="s2">point it&#39;s beautiful but when the old</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.050" end="01:25:50.869" style="s2">structures fade away and you have more</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.550" end="01:25:53.090" style="s2">and more people who just grew up with</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.869" end="01:25:54.650" style="s2">the internet like you are the mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.090" end="01:25:56.780" style="s2">and the Council on Foreign Relations</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.650" end="01:25:58.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like the heterodox thinkers who</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.780" end="01:26:01.219" style="s2">don&#39;t have much influence and I&#39;m half</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.820" end="01:26:03.079" style="s2">teasing you yeah but in fact I&#39;m mostly</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.219" end="01:26:06.650" style="s2">correct and you just don&#39;t see it yet</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.079" end="01:26:08.989" style="s2">because these kind of status hangover is</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.650" end="01:26:10.909" style="s2">still there they have like the thick oak</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.989" end="01:26:12.829" style="s2">desks whatever in there all I said we</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.909" end="01:26:14.539" style="s2">want that it&#39;s not that at all it has to</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.829" end="01:26:16.909" style="s2">do with the fact that I&#39;ve been in both</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.539" end="01:26:19.940" style="s2">worlds you know I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been at</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.909" end="01:26:22.579" style="s2">Harvard and MIT and Oxford and I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.940" end="01:26:24.829" style="s2">been shit out of luck and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.579" end="01:26:27.130" style="s2">oscillation between being in the good</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.829" end="01:26:29.300" style="s2">graces and outside of the good graces</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.130" end="01:26:31.099" style="s2">has impressed me a great deal I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.300" end="01:26:34.219" style="s2">more than than it has with you because</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.099" end="01:26:36.229" style="s2">you&#39;ve just charted a heterodox path</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.219" end="01:26:37.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve never been out of the good graces</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.229" end="01:26:40.309" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve just been ignored at times</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.880" end="01:26:43.519" style="s2">I&#39;ve never felt like the stress</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.309" end="01:26:46.249" style="s2">so the failure well okay I guess in</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.519" end="01:26:48.849" style="s2">terms of opportunity costs a lot of us</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.249" end="01:26:52.099" style="s2">view you as one of the most insightful</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.849" end="01:26:54.619" style="s2">and encyclopedic minds out there you do</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.099" end="01:26:58.249" style="s2">an unbelievable job of sifting for us</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.619" end="01:27:00.499" style="s2">and you&#39;re an unbelievable expose eater</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.249" end="01:27:03.709" style="s2">and we would we would naturally see you</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.499" end="01:27:08.839" style="s2">as at the very highest echelon and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.709" end="01:27:11.149" style="s2">think that view is now much much more</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.839" end="01:27:16.489" style="s2">widespread than it was 15 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.149" end="01:27:18.889" style="s2">right I mean you&#39;ve become time has</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.489" end="01:27:21.319" style="s2">treated you pretty well it&#39;s gone well</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.889" end="01:27:23.329" style="s2">for me yeah like if I&#39;m just out in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.319" end="01:27:25.039" style="s2">world and I don&#39;t like go out to place</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.329" end="01:27:28.099" style="s2">as much yeah just once a week someone</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.039" end="01:27:29.689" style="s2">will recognize me or like more than once</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.099" end="01:27:31.579" style="s2">a day someone will write me and like</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.689" end="01:27:33.079" style="s2">Express great let&#39;s go some clubbing on</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.579" end="01:27:34.789" style="s2">the Sunset Strip people are gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.079" end="01:27:37.699" style="s2">recognize you all I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.789" end="01:27:41.059" style="s2">the place me but uh I&#39;ve had a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.699" end="01:27:42.319" style="s2">good fortune I would say so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.059" end="01:27:45.229" style="s2">about something you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.319" end="01:27:47.059" style="s2">being 17 attic choosing to go to a</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.229" end="01:27:49.699" style="s2">commuter school you were playing guitar</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.059" end="01:27:52.999" style="s2">back then I think I&#39;ve started when I</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.699" end="01:27:55.249" style="s2">was 11 or 12 yeah and I quit like around</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.999" end="01:28:00.530" style="s2">the time I was 17 because I went to</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.249" end="01:28:04.010" style="s2">college and your musicianship informed</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.530" end="01:28:06.589" style="s2">you in terms of what the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.010" end="01:28:10.039" style="s2">music really is at its deepest level you</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.589" end="01:28:12.559" style="s2">have strong opinions about music and</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.039" end="01:28:14.300" style="s2">culture I was always terrible on guitar</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.559" end="01:28:16.249" style="s2">I wanted to learn different fields of</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.300" end="01:28:18.199" style="s2">music and I thought to do that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.249" end="01:28:20.479" style="s2">needed to play something yeah understand</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.199" end="01:28:22.849" style="s2">basics of music music theory chords</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.479" end="01:28:24.800" style="s2">whatever so I did a bit like classical</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.849" end="01:28:27.739" style="s2">jazz blues every different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.800" end="01:28:30.289" style="s2">guitar just a bit to have an entry point</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.739" end="01:28:32.030" style="s2">into the world of music it was never to</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.289" end="01:28:33.889" style="s2">play or impress people or I ever played</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.030" end="01:28:35.749" style="s2">for people and was never good but I</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.889" end="01:28:38.419" style="s2">could play the notes of a song to see</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.749" end="01:28:40.899" style="s2">how it fit together okay there is a kind</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.419" end="01:28:44.269" style="s2">of relativism that has descended over</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.899" end="01:28:45.889" style="s2">musical tastes where every time I say</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.269" end="01:28:49.039" style="s2">something is better than something else</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.889" end="01:28:50.839" style="s2">I run into somebody instantaneously</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.039" end="01:28:54.229" style="s2">telling me I&#39;ve committed like I get a</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.839" end="01:28:56.389" style="s2">traffic citation that you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.229" end="01:28:59.689" style="s2">you know that that Bach is much more</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.389" end="01:29:02.359" style="s2">important or better than scarlotti and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.689" end="01:29:08.569" style="s2">just don&#39;t understand this complete</p>

<p begin="01:33:11.090" end="01:33:16.180" style="s2">bananas over over Mozart they if</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.150" end="01:33:18.800" style="s2">somebody is very clear about BA like</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.180" end="01:33:20.300" style="s2">Bach is like heroin it&#39;s an addiction</p>

<p begin="01:33:21.380" end="01:33:24.949" style="s2">relate to that much more I often say</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.270" end="01:33:26.630" style="s2">that there are mathematicians who will</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.949" end="01:33:29.690" style="s2">claim that Bach isn&#39;t their favorite</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.630" end="01:33:31.520" style="s2">composer and I never believed them but</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.690" end="01:33:35.960" style="s2">you know take Mozart symphonies which</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.520" end="01:33:39.290" style="s2">are obviously chronological 29 is quite</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.960" end="01:33:42.949" style="s2">good and then not until you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.290" end="01:33:45.409" style="s2">36 you could say 33 34 but before 29</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.949" end="01:33:46.969" style="s2">they&#39;re just boring if they were somehow</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.409" end="01:33:47.810" style="s2">all gone I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be any</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.969" end="01:33:50.630" style="s2">great loss</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.810" end="01:33:52.610" style="s2">so most of Mozart isn&#39;t that good I</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.630" end="01:33:54.350" style="s2">don&#39;t think it detracts from him but</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.610" end="01:33:56.150" style="s2">even with Bach there&#39;s extreme selection</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.350" end="01:33:57.770" style="s2">which Bach you hear you don&#39;t hear most</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.150" end="01:33:59.389" style="s2">of they can Todd is very much most of</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.770" end="01:34:01.610" style="s2">them are boring yeah that was the main</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.389" end="01:34:03.440" style="s2">thing he created so there&#39;s some of that</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.610" end="01:34:05.510" style="s2">in Johann Sebastian as well you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.440" end="01:34:08.150" style="s2">exonerate him from the board and charge</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.510" end="01:34:11.120" style="s2">altogether Christmas oratorio it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.150" end="01:34:14.030" style="s2">pretty good it&#39;s not an incredible work</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.120" end="01:34:15.949" style="s2">so even st. John&#39;s passion it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.030" end="01:34:17.719" style="s2">good not as good as b-minor mask or st.</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.949" end="01:34:19.730" style="s2">Matthew&#39;s passion right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.719" end="01:34:22.550" style="s2">extreme selection in the bach you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.730" end="01:34:25.040" style="s2">hearing and thinking about I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.550" end="01:34:30.340" style="s2">know the funny thing for me is that I</p>

<p begin="01:34:38.380" end="01:34:44.239" style="s2">where the guitar wasn&#39;t originally</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.940" end="01:34:46.400" style="s2">thought of necessarily as a as a concert</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.239" end="01:34:49.489" style="s2">or art music instrument it was more of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.400" end="01:34:53.780" style="s2">folk instrument and so that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.489" end="01:34:56.290" style="s2">huge well of of interest for me like</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.780" end="01:34:58.850" style="s2">listening to ABBA Nissan on piano is</p>

<p begin="01:35:01.130" end="01:35:04.489" style="s2">the guitar music I find it very</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.420" end="01:35:06.920" style="s2">interesting to take some more modern</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.489" end="01:35:10.100" style="s2">like ambient music like Brian Eno or the</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.920" end="01:35:12.290" style="s2">whole movement from the 1970s and listen</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.100" end="01:35:14.210" style="s2">and think through what was going on</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.290" end="01:35:17.480" style="s2">there right and then go back to earlier</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.210" end="01:35:19.909" style="s2">guitar music Baroque but also the</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.480" end="01:35:21.980" style="s2">Spaniards and listen to it through that</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.909" end="01:35:23.210" style="s2">lens and it just comes alive and a</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.980" end="01:35:25.250" style="s2">completely new way I had that with</p>

<p begin="01:35:40.730" end="01:35:44.900" style="s2">you can kind of figuring out their</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.530" end="01:35:46.040" style="s2">logics and then going back and applying</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.900" end="01:35:48.380" style="s2">it to what you already knew from</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.040" end="01:35:51.170" style="s2">rock-and-roll or classical music or jazz</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.380" end="01:35:52.940" style="s2">and seeing it all you know quite a new</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.170" end="01:35:55.579" style="s2">re that&#39;s a very high productivity</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.940" end="01:35:56.960" style="s2">activity are you interested in in ode</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.579" end="01:36:00.440" style="s2">music sure of course</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.960" end="01:36:03.770" style="s2">so like when I found linear bashir in</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.440" end="01:36:06.340" style="s2">Iraq I just might my jaw dropped I</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.770" end="01:36:09.170" style="s2">thought this was such gorgeous stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.340" end="01:36:11.630" style="s2">then and I sort of made my way to</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.170" end="01:36:15.849" style="s2">Minerva shear through a fairy dalit rush</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.630" end="01:36:15.849" style="s2">who I think is unbelievable and</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.969" end="01:36:21.260" style="s2">eventually I was listening in this</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.500" end="01:36:23.989" style="s2">middle-eastern idiom and I hear him</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.260" end="01:36:26.869" style="s2">start to play with blues and rock and</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.989" end="01:36:30.679" style="s2">roll on the OOD and it was fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.869" end="01:36:32.960" style="s2">watching somebody from Iraq who&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.679" end="01:36:36.590" style="s2">studied in Europe of course watching you</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.960" end="01:36:40.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a for example in at Stanford</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.590" end="01:36:44.119" style="s2">University there&#39;s this garden which I</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.460" end="01:36:47.570" style="s2">think has master carvings from Polynesia</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.119" end="01:36:49.880" style="s2">Indonesia and there&#39;s versions of</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.570" end="01:36:56.659" style="s2">rodin&#39;s gates of Hell in the thinker in</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.880" end="01:36:58.849" style="s2">this Polynesian or Indonesian idiom and</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.659" end="01:37:02.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just fascinating to see oneself</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.849" end="01:37:03.770" style="s2">regarded by the other sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.360" end="01:37:06.380" style="s2">the more interesting question is which</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.770" end="01:37:07.760" style="s2">musics don&#39;t you like and to think</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.380" end="01:37:09.469" style="s2">through those so I&#39;m gonna ask you a</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.760" end="01:37:12.290" style="s2">Rick why didn&#39;t use ik do you really not</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.469" end="01:37:16.040" style="s2">like or con - and I think it&#39;s just bad</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.290" end="01:37:19.900" style="s2">or wrong somehow I have trouble with</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.040" end="01:37:23.630" style="s2">music that doesn&#39;t allow us to impart</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.900" end="01:37:26.719" style="s2">more emotion because it&#39;s too highly</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.630" end="01:37:28.639" style="s2">produced and I&#39;m pretty sure that has to</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.719" end="01:37:32.659" style="s2">do with the emotion because I find Jimi</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.639" end="01:37:35.420" style="s2">Hendrix very emotional I found that</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.659" end="01:37:37.400" style="s2">shares believe where she uses the</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.420" end="01:37:39.199" style="s2">auto-tune function as an instrument</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.400" end="01:37:42.860" style="s2">rather than as a correcting of the human</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.199" end="01:37:47.510" style="s2">voice to be very emotional but when I</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.860" end="01:37:48.690" style="s2">hear very like computer oriented or can</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.510" end="01:37:51.360" style="s2">you name a name</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.690" end="01:37:54.030" style="s2">what do you reject point the finger nah</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.360" end="01:37:55.860" style="s2">geez do I have to you have to its your</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.030" end="01:37:58.639" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.860" end="01:38:02.460" style="s2">I must hope the person isn&#39;t listening</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.639" end="01:38:04.530" style="s2">well I guess there was a time when I</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.460" end="01:38:09.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t like Amy Stuart&#39;s version of</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.530" end="01:38:14.310" style="s2">knock on wood which was a great piano</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.960" end="01:38:17.429" style="s2">R&amp;B song because I found that it was so</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.310" end="01:38:20.370" style="s2">highly overproduced that I just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.429" end="01:38:23.219" style="s2">cotton to it and that had to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.370" end="01:38:25.400" style="s2">disco influence I&#39;m choosing things now</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.219" end="01:38:28.889" style="s2">that I really dislike but I&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.400" end="01:38:32.659" style="s2">maybe come around because I find no look</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.889" end="01:38:35.070" style="s2">you find something in just about</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.659" end="01:38:37.020" style="s2">everything that you listen to it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.070" end="01:38:40.020" style="s2">hard to create music that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.020" end="01:38:43.370" style="s2">devoid of interest and so if I spend</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.020" end="01:38:46.409" style="s2">more time with something even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.370" end="01:38:49.260" style="s2">really bad I&#39;ll usually be able to find</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.409" end="01:38:51.150" style="s2">something in it that well that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.260" end="01:38:52.920" style="s2">became famous and that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.150" end="01:38:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s being listened to I&#39;ve been down on</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.920" end="01:38:59.219" style="s2">EDM to be blunt I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.960" end="01:39:01.199" style="s2">at some point made a car ride with a</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.219" end="01:39:02.820" style="s2">friend and I said put on songs we can</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.199" end="01:39:04.650" style="s2">sing along with the person puts on some</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.820" end="01:39:07.590" style="s2">EDM there was nothing close to a</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.650" end="01:39:10.050" style="s2">campfire song inside of it I found that</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.590" end="01:39:12.449" style="s2">kind of sad you buy into electronic</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.050" end="01:39:16.170" style="s2">dance music sorry heavy metal I meant to</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.449" end="01:39:18.270" style="s2">say heavy metal such as I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.170" end="01:39:20.190" style="s2">lot of artistry in it so I asked to</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.270" end="01:39:21.840" style="s2">enjoy this when I did my conversations</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.190" end="01:39:23.280" style="s2">with Feiler podcast with him he&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.840" end="01:39:26.010" style="s2">my favorite music critics a brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.280" end="01:39:27.540" style="s2">guy you should have him on but I asked</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.010" end="01:39:29.100" style="s2">him at heavy metal I said underrated or</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.540" end="01:39:30.600" style="s2">overrated and he said well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.100" end="01:39:32.100" style="s2">underrated but I couldn&#39;t get him to</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.600" end="01:39:34.230" style="s2">admit that he actually listened to it</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.100" end="01:39:36.719" style="s2">okay so you want to go there</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.230" end="01:39:38.900" style="s2">I think it&#39;s underrated from technical</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.719" end="01:39:41.250" style="s2">musicianship and I think it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.900" end="01:39:43.409" style="s2">overrated in terms of what it does to</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.250" end="01:39:45.449" style="s2">heart Paul Gilbert that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.409" end="01:39:47.040" style="s2">he said in other words okay so Paul</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.449" end="01:39:48.360" style="s2">Gilbert has a beautiful riff on this</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.040" end="01:39:50.280" style="s2">he&#39;s a you know obviously fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.360" end="01:39:53.429" style="s2">guitarist but he says you can take a</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.280" end="01:39:56.489" style="s2">great blues guitar guitarist teach them</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.429" end="01:39:58.620" style="s2">a lot of scales and turn them into a</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.489" end="01:40:01.260" style="s2">shredder of devoid of interest but with</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.620" end="01:40:02.130" style="s2">fantastic technical chops I think that</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.260" end="01:40:07.409" style="s2">that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.130" end="01:40:10.650" style="s2">sad I think that what one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.409" end="01:40:15.570" style="s2">I&#39;m very concerned about is the fall-off</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.650" end="01:40:17.370" style="s2">an interest in musicianship like in</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.570" end="01:40:20.250" style="s2">guitar at the moment we have these</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.370" end="01:40:23.850" style="s2">fantastic guitar virtuosos who live on</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.250" end="01:40:26.219" style="s2">YouTube and Instagram and the guitar</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.850" end="01:40:28.170" style="s2">universe is paying attention to them but</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.219" end="01:40:31.920" style="s2">the outside universe is not there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.170" end="01:40:33.750" style="s2">guy Guthrie Govan who lots of people I</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.920" end="01:40:38.780" style="s2">know have never heard of this guy and</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.750" end="01:40:41.580" style="s2">he&#39;s an unbelievable gift to the guitar</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.780" end="01:40:43.500" style="s2">where is he what group is he part of</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.580" end="01:40:45.120" style="s2">what are his main songs you know he can</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.500" end="01:40:45.929" style="s2">he can be anyone and then he can be his</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.120" end="01:40:48.060" style="s2">own thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.929" end="01:40:51.330" style="s2">he&#39;s like the granite of guitar I guess</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.060" end="01:40:55.050" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s very odd to me that</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.330" end="01:40:56.969" style="s2">or for example percussive guitar there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.050" end="01:40:59.610" style="s2">a guy named Justin King who did a song</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.969" end="01:41:01.739" style="s2">oddly enough called knock on wood which</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.610" end="01:41:03.420" style="s2">just showcases how many ways you can now</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.739" end="01:41:06.630" style="s2">interact with your instrument through</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.420" end="01:41:08.699" style="s2">harmonics and various you know patterns</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.630" end="01:41:11.429" style="s2">of drumming on the wood the way the</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.699" end="01:41:13.860" style="s2">flamenco guitarists used to brought to a</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.429" end="01:41:16.199" style="s2">high level I can&#39;t get a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.860" end="01:41:17.940" style="s2">interested in all of the weird</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.199" end="01:41:19.380" style="s2">innovations that are taking place a</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.940" end="01:41:21.449" style="s2">little bit like rodney mullen and</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.380" end="01:41:23.250" style="s2">skateboarding where originally you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.449" end="01:41:24.750" style="s2">skateboarding on four wheels and then</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.250" end="01:41:26.730" style="s2">his point is like well okay well what</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.750" end="01:41:27.780" style="s2">else can we do you&#39;re thinking well what</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.730" end="01:41:30.389" style="s2">do you mean well maybe we could</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.780" end="01:41:32.100" style="s2">skateboard on the bottom side or on the</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.389" end="01:41:34.170" style="s2">sides of the skateboard and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.100" end="01:41:35.850" style="s2">thinking does that even make sense and</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.170" end="01:41:37.230" style="s2">he says well sure I&#39;ll show you well</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.850" end="01:41:38.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what percussive guitar has been</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.230" end="01:41:41.190" style="s2">for me it told me that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.610" end="01:41:43.139" style="s2">understand the instrument more or less</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.190" end="01:41:45.120" style="s2">at all something else I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.139" end="01:41:46.920" style="s2">enthusiastic about is sugar blue on</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.120" end="01:41:48.300" style="s2">harmonica do you know this guy not known</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.920" end="01:41:50.400" style="s2">to me I don&#39;t know the song is it on</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.300" end="01:41:52.380" style="s2">YouTube do you know the song miss you by</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.400" end="01:41:55.320" style="s2">the Rolling Stone all right well that</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.380" end="01:41:58.050" style="s2">that that harmonica is sugar blue</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.320" end="01:41:59.310" style="s2">obviously the guy who can thread that if</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.050" end="01:42:01.380" style="s2">you break the harmonic into three</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.310" end="01:42:03.000" style="s2">registers he can thread the top register</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.380" end="01:42:05.699" style="s2">like nobody&#39;s business and he and John</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.000" end="01:42:07.650" style="s2">popper of Blues Traveler we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.699" end="01:42:09.960" style="s2">locked in some artistic conversation the</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.650" end="01:42:11.820" style="s2">rest of us can barely understand like</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.960" end="01:42:13.500" style="s2">that excites the hell out of me because</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.820" end="01:42:15.780" style="s2">you&#39;re taking an instrument that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.500" end="01:42:17.099" style="s2">limited and you&#39;re saying Wow</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.780" end="01:42:18.000" style="s2">it&#39;s only limited to you because you</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.099" end="01:42:20.340" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out what she could do</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.000" end="01:42:22.860" style="s2">with it other than Bach maybe South</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.340" end="01:42:24.750" style="s2">Indian classical music is the closest we</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.860" end="01:42:26.369" style="s2">have in music to mathematics and at</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.750" end="01:42:29.460" style="s2">times I think what he says I listen to</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.369" end="01:42:32.280" style="s2">that because I would have said you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.460" end="01:42:34.469" style="s2">whoever somehow the North Indian no the</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.280" end="01:42:37.860" style="s2">South the Carnatic yeah I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.469" end="01:42:39.510" style="s2">North Indian I mean look the this is</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.860" end="01:42:43.500" style="s2">just a world that I knew nothing about</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.510" end="01:42:45.869" style="s2">and I chanced upon this book of a</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.500" end="01:42:47.130" style="s2">musicologist named Neal Sorrell called</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.869" end="01:42:48.840" style="s2">something like Indian music in</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.130" end="01:42:51.869" style="s2">performance you can find it on the</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.840" end="01:42:54.270" style="s2">internet with lots of little sound files</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.869" end="01:42:56.159" style="s2">that he made for a cassette way back in</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.270" end="01:42:58.829" style="s2">the day and he took it an entire</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.159" end="01:43:02.969" style="s2">performance of ROM Narayan the great</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.829" end="01:43:05.670" style="s2">sarangi playin violinist man this is</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.969" end="01:43:09.000" style="s2">just how did I not know there was an</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.670" end="01:43:10.710" style="s2">entire universe of Indian classical</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.000" end="01:43:13.079" style="s2">music you may be partial to the South</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.710" end="01:43:15.090" style="s2">I&#39;m very partial to the north but south</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.079" end="01:43:17.280" style="s2">north along with Bach and maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.090" end="01:43:19.139" style="s2">Beatles it has the only other serious</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.280" end="01:43:21.030" style="s2">claim to being the best music period</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.139" end="01:43:23.610" style="s2">all right the beatles defend yourself so</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.030" end="01:43:26.969" style="s2">what&#39;s your take on three beatles songs</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.610" end="01:43:29.369" style="s2">that are at least current and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.969" end="01:43:32.969" style="s2">thinking and that really show off how</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.369" end="01:43:35.010" style="s2">deep that cannon is was it 1966 you</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.969" end="01:43:37.020" style="s2">won&#39;t see me it&#39;s basically a paul song</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.010" end="01:43:38.880" style="s2">but the melancholy have the background</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.020" end="01:43:41.400" style="s2">vocals operate what&#39;s done with the</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.880" end="01:43:42.780" style="s2">piano the bass line it operates on so</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.400" end="01:43:44.940" style="s2">many different levels at once just</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.780" end="01:43:46.409" style="s2">sounds like a simple ballad but every</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.940" end="01:43:49.559" style="s2">time you listen to it there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.409" end="01:43:51.929" style="s2">new in their complex emotionally and</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.559" end="01:43:52.409" style="s2">then it&#39;s just over you never give me</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.929" end="01:43:54.539" style="s2">your money</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.409" end="01:43:56.489" style="s2">the last 10 15 seconds are just</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.539" end="01:43:58.889" style="s2">phenomenal Paul had been listening to</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.489" end="01:44:00.329" style="s2">John Cage and Stockhausen and just sound</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.889" end="01:44:02.520" style="s2">and what&#39;s the dividing line between</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.329" end="01:44:03.869" style="s2">sound and music and he just sticks that</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.520" end="01:44:05.699" style="s2">in the end of a Beatle song with a</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.869" end="01:44:07.889" style="s2">lovely melody and the whole thing just</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.699" end="01:44:10.079" style="s2">dissolves and then you get back to</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.889" end="01:44:14.550" style="s2">marching through the Abbey Road side to</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.079" end="01:44:16.590" style="s2">medley Hey Jude this is so many Beatles</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.550" end="01:44:17.969" style="s2">songs that I think are just phenomenally</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.590" end="01:44:21.119" style="s2">better than what other people who are</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.969" end="01:44:23.309" style="s2">doing and they synthesize more different</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.119" end="01:44:25.500" style="s2">parts of music than anything Bach did</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.309" end="01:44:28.330" style="s2">that&#39;s their claim to greatness in terms</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.500" end="01:44:29.980" style="s2">though it slows levels okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.330" end="01:44:31.780" style="s2">needles mostly lennon-mccartney they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.980" end="01:44:33.460" style="s2">composing these songs and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.780" end="01:44:36.010" style="s2">playing them and they&#39;re singing them</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.460" end="01:44:37.630" style="s2">and they&#39;re producing them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.010" end="01:44:39.610" style="s2">a-plus excellent in all of those</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.630" end="01:44:42.160" style="s2">dimensions yes on their best material</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.610" end="01:44:43.990" style="s2">and Bach was a composer probably an</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.160" end="01:44:45.910" style="s2">excellent player we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.990" end="01:44:48.670" style="s2">but he was reputed to be very good easy</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.910" end="01:44:51.040" style="s2">enough to believe the Beatles take on</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.670" end="01:44:53.710" style="s2">and added three or four dimensions that</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.040" end="01:44:56.230" style="s2">are not in classical music and master</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.710" end="01:44:57.700" style="s2">them and then every album they changed</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.230" end="01:44:58.930" style="s2">their style every song they changed</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.700" end="01:45:00.550" style="s2">their style they hardly repeat</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.930" end="01:45:02.800" style="s2">themselves yes they have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.550" end="01:45:03.550" style="s2">clunkers they had the two best voices in</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.800" end="01:45:07.990" style="s2">rock and roll</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.550" end="01:45:10.030" style="s2">John and Paul Monroe all right it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.990" end="01:45:11.470" style="s2">impressive all right let&#39;s have a small</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.030" end="01:45:13.090" style="s2">fight we&#39;ll get back Aretha Franklin</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.470" end="01:45:15.370" style="s2">when the Rolling Stones Paul she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.090" end="01:45:16.780" style="s2">wonderful what would you have said she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.370" end="01:45:18.850" style="s2">less first I told them that I would have</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.780" end="01:45:22.480" style="s2">got my Freddy Mercury and Roy Orbison</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.850" end="01:45:24.310" style="s2">where am I wrong Roy Orbison has eight</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.480" end="01:45:25.480" style="s2">or nine amazing songs which are</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.310" end="01:45:28.270" style="s2">incredible and the Beatles themselves</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.480" end="01:45:31.150" style="s2">loved right but that&#39;s kind of a then</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.270" end="01:45:34.510" style="s2">it&#39;s ready mercury sir Freddie Mercury</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.150" end="01:45:37.420" style="s2">has one album two albums you can listen</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.510" end="01:45:41.080" style="s2">to straight through his vocal effect is</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.420" end="01:45:43.240" style="s2">most of the time broadly the same he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.080" end="01:45:47.320" style="s2">one of the top vocalists absolutely and</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.240" end="01:45:50.160" style="s2">I know you&#39;re partial maybe to Parsi</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.320" end="01:45:53.680" style="s2">culture and where he comes from</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.160" end="01:45:55.680" style="s2">drag that in but in terms of versatility</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.680" end="01:45:58.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t think he&#39;s close to the Beatles</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.680" end="01:46:00.370" style="s2">thank you and I love Queen and I went to</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.240" end="01:46:01.720" style="s2">see them play not with Freddie Mercury</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.370" end="01:46:04.990" style="s2">but with Adam Lambert who did a</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.720" end="01:46:07.000" style="s2">fantastic job I thought I still listen</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.990" end="01:46:10.180" style="s2">to Queen I&#39;m a big fan but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.000" end="01:46:11.400" style="s2">totally the relational way I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.180" end="01:46:13.630" style="s2">that&#39;s true I think that they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.400" end="01:46:16.540" style="s2">maybe two dimensions there&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.630" end="01:46:19.450" style="s2">shredder a early punk semi-metal style</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.540" end="01:46:21.970" style="s2">well then there&#39;s the ballads I just</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.450" end="01:46:25.360" style="s2">love my life you hurt me no I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.970" end="01:46:27.190" style="s2">Brian May is so incredibly tasteful I</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.360" end="01:46:29.620" style="s2">agree he doesn&#39;t have to play a note</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.190" end="01:46:33.640" style="s2">more or less than he wants he&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.620" end="01:46:34.750" style="s2">needy and then you know Roger Taylor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.640" end="01:46:37.030" style="s2">I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.750" end="01:46:38.590" style="s2">love with my car I think is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.030" end="01:46:41.680" style="s2">most comically brilliant songs I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.590" end="01:46:43.600" style="s2">heard so I and I don&#39;t even listen to</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.680" end="01:46:45.670" style="s2">that much queen are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.600" end="01:46:47.920" style="s2">the voice of Eva Cassidy given that you</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.670" end="01:46:50.350" style="s2">were in the Washington area for a long</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.920" end="01:46:52.150" style="s2">time only marginally but I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.350" end="01:46:52.600" style="s2">heard it live if that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.150" end="01:46:54.730" style="s2">asking</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.600" end="01:46:56.950" style="s2">just there&#39;s an album called live at</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.730" end="01:47:00.010" style="s2">Blues Alley where she does a version of</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.950" end="01:47:02.200" style="s2">stormy Monday that just tears my heart</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.010" end="01:47:03.210" style="s2">and shreds and barely puts it back</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.200" end="01:47:05.110" style="s2">together by the end it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.210" end="01:47:06.640" style="s2">unbelievable performance of a song I</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.110" end="01:47:08.500" style="s2">thought I&#39;ve heard everybody&#39;s version</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.640" end="01:47:09.730" style="s2">of it and just just said well you</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.500" end="01:47:11.800" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard this one apparently she</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.730" end="01:47:13.480" style="s2">was sick while the recording session was</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.800" end="01:47:15.670" style="s2">happening and so some magic happened to</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.480" end="01:47:17.470" style="s2">her voice because of the illness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.670" end="01:47:20.560" style="s2">really interesting yes Cecille Maclaurin</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.470" end="01:47:22.510" style="s2">sulphate is my favorite jazz popular</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.560" end="01:47:24.400" style="s2">song vocalist and she&#39;s active now I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.510" end="01:47:26.260" style="s2">seen her three times I think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.400" end="01:47:28.870" style="s2">better than Ella Fitzgerald she&#39;s in her</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.260" end="01:47:31.270" style="s2">prime she&#39;s maybe about thirty plays or</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.870" end="01:47:33.640" style="s2">you know around in club&#39;s very often has</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.270" end="01:47:36.220" style="s2">plenty of CDs I love Ella Fitzgerald and</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.640" end="01:47:39.970" style="s2">never put her on why is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.220" end="01:47:41.680" style="s2">little exaggerated and mannered and she</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.970" end="01:47:45.070" style="s2">was trying too hard her technique is</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.680" end="01:47:48.130" style="s2">incredible but it&#39;s always excessively</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.070" end="01:47:50.560" style="s2">Oh conscious of what the audience is</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.130" end="01:47:52.330" style="s2">thinking for me you know I used to enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.560" end="01:47:54.940" style="s2">it when I here but I also never put it I</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.330" end="01:47:57.100" style="s2">use it as like the gold standard for</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.940" end="01:48:00.040" style="s2">lots of things like Cole Porter and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.100" end="01:48:02.140" style="s2">it&#39;s summer it is yeah I don&#39;t I I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.040" end="01:48:05.530" style="s2">that there&#39;s something in my tastes that</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.140" end="01:48:07.780" style="s2">have changed with the time and I now</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.530" end="01:48:09.760" style="s2">just never I never reach for it you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.780" end="01:48:11.860" style="s2">like Art Tatum I always enjoy when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.760" end="01:48:14.100" style="s2">listening to his piano work but I never</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.860" end="01:48:16.660" style="s2">think boy am I in an Art Tatum mood</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.100" end="01:48:18.760" style="s2">because how can you be in an Art Tatum</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.660" end="01:48:21.730" style="s2">ooh it&#39;s so exacting and demanding on</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.760" end="01:48:25.450" style="s2">the ear that like that&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.730" end="01:48:27.100" style="s2">that happens he might have been the one</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.450" end="01:48:29.890" style="s2">of the two greatest jazz pianists with</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.100" end="01:48:32.410" style="s2">monk but I or Cecil Taylor well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.890" end="01:48:33.850" style="s2">hear new things when I hear Tatum it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.410" end="01:48:35.920" style="s2">just perfect right it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.850" end="01:48:38.140" style="s2">and it contains every style of its time</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.920" end="01:48:39.970" style="s2">and then some but I don&#39;t feel the need</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.140" end="01:48:42.040" style="s2">to go back to it I&#39;m okay with that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.970" end="01:48:44.650" style="s2">okay gone down in my eyes but I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.040" end="01:48:46.219" style="s2">whatever nobody was ever really able to</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.650" end="01:48:49.489" style="s2">work with there&#39;s a guy named</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.219" end="01:48:51.110" style="s2">Rick Lewis who I think I connect to</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.489" end="01:48:55.130" style="s2">Tatum and I start to say oh well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.110" end="01:48:57.170" style="s2">if I saw this as being part of a of a</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.130" end="01:48:59.389" style="s2">lineage but it&#39;s there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.170" end="01:49:01.309" style="s2">the fact that you know Hendrix didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.389" end="01:49:03.710" style="s2">really leave descendants on the guitar</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.309" end="01:49:05.599" style="s2">and I feel like Tatum didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.710" end="01:49:08.090" style="s2">leave descendants on the piano</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.599" end="01:49:10.130" style="s2">well the monk really surprised some ways</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.090" end="01:49:10.940" style="s2">he&#39;s a funny descendant of Tatum more</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.130" end="01:49:14.199" style="s2">than you would think</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.940" end="01:49:17.210" style="s2">monk monk he has very little technique</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.199" end="01:49:19.820" style="s2">but the idea of integrating styles and</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.210" end="01:49:22.219" style="s2">making jokes he was in my opinion highly</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.820" end="01:49:23.780" style="s2">influenced by art tatum he just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.219" end="01:49:25.880" style="s2">play the piano very well but as a</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.780" end="01:49:26.989" style="s2">composer he&#39;s phenomenal I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.880" end="01:49:29.090" style="s2">Don solo monk</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.989" end="01:49:30.820" style="s2">it could be the best jazz in our album</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.090" end="01:49:37.210" style="s2">the theory is and I still listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.820" end="01:49:40.670" style="s2">do you ever take on the weirdness of</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.210" end="01:49:44.479" style="s2">Miles Davis generosity to us all in</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.670" end="01:49:47.539" style="s2">terms of leaving this beautiful legacy</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.479" end="01:49:49.849" style="s2">and his being a complete dick well a lot</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.539" end="01:49:51.229" style="s2">of wonderful creators have been complete</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.849" end="01:49:53.630" style="s2">dicks there&#39;s a long list of those</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.229" end="01:49:56.329" style="s2">Picasso some people have said John</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.630" end="01:49:58.249" style="s2">Lennon I don&#39;t know the full list but</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.329" end="01:50:01.429" style="s2">he&#39;s not some unusual data point to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.249" end="01:50:03.409" style="s2">explained partly there might be</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.429" end="01:50:05.960" style="s2">correlations between creativity and</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.409" end="01:50:08.239" style="s2">having unusual brains right right and</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.960" end="01:50:11.119" style="s2">then once you&#39;re succeeding you can get</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.239" end="01:50:13.820" style="s2">away with a lot more and then drugs into</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.119" end="01:50:16.909" style="s2">the equation for Davis and Lennon and</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.820" end="01:50:18.409" style="s2">bad things happen so this is not a huge</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.909" end="01:50:21.579" style="s2">surprise all right oh so getting back to</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.409" end="01:50:21.579" style="s2">the Beatles okay</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.670" end="01:50:28.219" style="s2">when Lennon writes the song was how do</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.429" end="01:50:31.070" style="s2">you sleep right after the Beatles have</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.219" end="01:50:33.110" style="s2">broken up he he makes a reference to</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.070" end="01:50:34.789" style="s2">something about you didn&#39;t see Sgt</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.110" end="01:50:36.619" style="s2">pepper&#39;s if Sgt pepper&#39;s took you by</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.789" end="01:50:38.210" style="s2">surprise you&#39;d better see right through</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.619" end="01:50:39.829" style="s2">that mother&#39;s eyes yeah it means Paul</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.210" end="01:50:41.420" style="s2">McCartney so he admits Sergeant Pepper</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.829" end="01:50:45.309" style="s2">with Paul&#39;s album which it kind of was</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.420" end="01:50:47.749" style="s2">that&#39;s quite an admission well is that</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.309" end="01:50:51.019" style="s2">Paul was the workaholic in the Beatles</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.749" end="01:50:52.460" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the key point here so what I</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.019" end="01:50:54.499" style="s2">hadn&#39;t understood and this is only</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.460" end="01:50:57.670" style="s2">because I happened to weirdly be friends</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.499" end="01:51:00.910" style="s2">with with John son Sean</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.670" end="01:51:03.750" style="s2">is Sean points very clearly to</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.910" end="01:51:06.730" style="s2">Strawberry Fields forever as being the</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.750" end="01:51:10.210" style="s2">discontinuity in Lennon&#39;s ability as a</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.730" end="01:51:12.250" style="s2">composer I agree with that what okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.210" end="01:51:14.260" style="s2">how did I miss this and how do you see</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.250" end="01:51:17.320" style="s2">that well I don&#39;t know that you missed</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.260" end="01:51:18.790" style="s2">it I did miss it it&#39;s John&#39;s group you</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.320" end="01:51:20.380" style="s2">look at hard day&#39;s night album there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.790" end="01:51:22.120" style="s2">hardly any Paul songs on there&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.380" end="01:51:24.489" style="s2">you said today which is amazing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.120" end="01:51:27.040" style="s2">a John album and it&#39;s pretty close to</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.489" end="01:51:28.750" style="s2">perfect even John&#39;s like first real song</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.040" end="01:51:30.790" style="s2">please please me one of the best Beatles</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.750" end="01:51:34.120" style="s2">songs completely visceral hits you in</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.790" end="01:51:36.340" style="s2">the gut still sounds amazing but I think</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.120" end="01:51:40.420" style="s2">after Strawberry Fields John stopped</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.340" end="01:51:43.030" style="s2">innovating he had an amazing voice</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.420" end="01:51:44.800" style="s2">emotionally which he still could use you</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.030" end="01:51:47.440" style="s2">have songs like I am The Walrus which</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.800" end="01:51:50.620" style="s2">have a kind of even melodic line and a</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.440" end="01:51:53.170" style="s2">bit of pulsating but when you start to</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.620" end="01:51:55.140" style="s2">hear John songs through the lens of a</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.170" end="01:51:57.670" style="s2">few applied machine learning to them</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.140" end="01:51:59.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a similar structure to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.670" end="01:52:02.530" style="s2">the melodies they don&#39;t move around that</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.860" end="01:52:04.060" style="s2">much the way Paul melodies do and Paul</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.530" end="01:52:05.590" style="s2">being the workaholic just gets better</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.060" end="01:52:07.030" style="s2">and better and better and Paul learns</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.590" end="01:52:09.280" style="s2">from George Martin and Paul learns</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.030" end="01:52:11.140" style="s2">orchestration Paul even became a good</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.280" end="01:52:11.770" style="s2">classical music composer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.140" end="01:52:15.580" style="s2">phenomenal</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.770" end="01:52:17.260" style="s2">and by the time of Sergeant Pepper it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.580" end="01:52:19.570" style="s2">Paul&#39;s group and Paul is calling the</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.260" end="01:52:21.460" style="s2">shots Abbey Road side to is you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.570" end="01:52:23.560" style="s2">basically Paul&#39;s work Paul&#39;s creation</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.460" end="01:52:25.449" style="s2">even with the John songs a piece like</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.560" end="01:52:27.670" style="s2">Tomorrow Never Knows which is John</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.449" end="01:52:29.980" style="s2">singing John composed a very flat</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.670" end="01:52:31.719" style="s2">melodic line but the whole construction</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.980" end="01:52:34.510" style="s2">of the sound was mostly Paul and Paul</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.719" end="01:52:36.280" style="s2">will take credit for that so it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.510" end="01:52:37.870" style="s2">Paul&#39;s group John feels more pushed out</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.280" end="01:52:41.580" style="s2">it&#39;s the start of the Beatles breaking</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.870" end="01:52:44.110" style="s2">up and so on yeah so they&#39;re these</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.580" end="01:52:46.300" style="s2">dynamics within the group that I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.110" end="01:52:49.239" style="s2">never actually studied the Beatles</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.300" end="01:52:51.370" style="s2">enough but like songs like across the</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.239" end="01:52:53.890" style="s2">universe don&#39;t really impress themselves</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.370" end="01:52:56.500" style="s2">upon you as being it&#39;s that same kind of</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.890" end="01:52:59.170" style="s2">even not much varying melodic line</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.500" end="01:53:01.090" style="s2">carried by John&#39;s voice and mood and the</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.170" end="01:53:04.270" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s the Beatles I like the</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.090" end="01:53:06.670" style="s2">song but Paul is experimenting much more</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.270" end="01:53:08.380" style="s2">by then and I see very interest here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.670" end="01:53:09.790" style="s2">the thing about how do you sleep by John</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.380" end="01:53:11.480" style="s2">it was I learned recently it was</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.790" end="01:53:15.590" style="s2">actually Paul who started that phew</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.480" end="01:53:17.240" style="s2">yeah Paul had a song to many people you</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.590" end="01:53:18.950" style="s2">know that was your lucky break and he</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.240" end="01:53:21.200" style="s2">was really mocking John like oh it was</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.950" end="01:53:23.990" style="s2">lucky that you you know hung out with me</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.200" end="01:53:26.000" style="s2">and John was retaliating people think</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.990" end="01:53:27.670" style="s2">John is the aggressor and that but Paul</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.000" end="01:53:29.630" style="s2">was like super passive-aggressive</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.670" end="01:53:31.070" style="s2">alright then I want to put together a</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.630" end="01:53:33.080" style="s2">data series and I want to get your</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.070" end="01:53:35.000" style="s2">reaction to it so I&#39;m gonna start with</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.080" end="01:53:36.170" style="s2">Gilbert and Sullivan and I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.000" end="01:53:43.150" style="s2">Jagger and Richards</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.170" end="01:53:45.160" style="s2">yeah Lennon McCartney Perry and Tyler</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.150" end="01:53:48.080" style="s2">Aerosmith uh-huh</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.160" end="01:53:52.000" style="s2">what the hell&#39;s going on with these</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.080" end="01:53:56.470" style="s2">dyads that are so combustible both</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.000" end="01:53:59.660" style="s2">really benefit from the antagonize</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.470" end="01:54:02.420" style="s2">relationship and we end up with this</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.660" end="01:54:04.820" style="s2">incredible music but it&#39;s it&#39;s so effing</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.420" end="01:54:06.500" style="s2">personal well it&#39;s rivalry it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.820" end="01:54:09.350" style="s2">really motivates people yes it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.500" end="01:54:10.970" style="s2">money also of course but wanting to do</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.350" end="01:54:13.820" style="s2">better than the other and having the</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.970" end="01:54:15.530" style="s2">other as a mantle audience I think it</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.820" end="01:54:17.390" style="s2">was Peter teal who had this on one of</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.530" end="01:54:19.130" style="s2">his talks once that he has these</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.390" end="01:54:20.600" style="s2">different images of people sitting on</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.130" end="01:54:23.090" style="s2">the shoulder what would this person</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.600" end="01:54:25.460" style="s2">think what would that person think I</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.090" end="01:54:27.050" style="s2">have an Eric Weinstein and a Peter deal</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.460" end="01:54:29.840" style="s2">sitting on my shoulder among others</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.050" end="01:54:31.820" style="s2">right we all have Tyler coated arts so I</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.840" end="01:54:33.530" style="s2">call it you know like phantom Eric</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.820" end="01:54:35.960" style="s2">Weinstein or phantom Peter Thiel do you</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.530" end="01:54:37.700" style="s2">run me an emulation what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.960" end="01:54:40.730" style="s2">that I try to run you in emulation</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.700" end="01:54:42.590" style="s2">sometimes I think about Tyler like I</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.730" end="01:54:44.240" style="s2">start to get emotional about something</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.590" end="01:54:45.830" style="s2">Tyler was not gonna fall for that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.240" end="01:54:47.420" style="s2">gonna be even keeled he&#39;s gonna think</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.830" end="01:54:49.340" style="s2">about what&#39;s likely to be true</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.420" end="01:54:53.930" style="s2">he&#39;s not going to think about how to</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.340" end="01:54:56.690" style="s2">make the biggest splash and like I have</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.930" end="01:54:58.880" style="s2">these rules that can&#39;t generate you and</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.690" end="01:55:00.440" style="s2">what I consider to be your brilliance</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.880" end="01:55:03.950" style="s2">and contribution but it can it can</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.440" end="01:55:06.140" style="s2">generate a kind of thumbnail sketch of</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.950" end="01:55:08.030" style="s2">you without you needing to be present oh</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.140" end="01:55:10.160" style="s2">sure but it&#39;s harder to have a phantom</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.030" end="01:55:12.320" style="s2">Eric Weinstein because the phantom Eric</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.160" end="01:55:14.720" style="s2">Weinstein is about being generative and</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.320" end="01:55:16.970" style="s2">that&#39;s harder to model than a phantom</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.720" end="01:55:19.490" style="s2">Tyler Cowen so if you think if part of</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.970" end="01:55:21.350" style="s2">me is even keeled even keeled might be</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.490" end="01:55:23.840" style="s2">hard to achieve but it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.350" end="01:55:24.680" style="s2">to model just like calm down all right I</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.840" end="01:55:27.320" style="s2">can&#39;t I have</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.680" end="01:55:29.390" style="s2">I&#39;m so driven by passion hard to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.320" end="01:55:30.950" style="s2">but not hard to model so you might</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.390" end="01:55:32.300" style="s2">reject your phantom Tyler cam well</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.950" end="01:55:34.790" style="s2">that&#39;s true one of the things I do is it</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.300" end="01:55:36.890" style="s2">has a very strong filter which says if</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.790" end="01:55:38.780" style="s2">the emotional register has been exceeded</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.890" end="01:55:40.640" style="s2">by this much of that much and in either</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.780" end="01:55:42.530" style="s2">direction Tyler wouldn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.640" end="01:55:44.690" style="s2">call up phantom Tyler Cowen it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.530" end="01:55:46.280" style="s2">there by the phone even the real Tyler</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.690" end="01:55:48.830" style="s2">Cameron will probably answer the phone</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.280" end="01:55:51.170" style="s2">but you&#39;re harder to model for that</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.830" end="01:55:53.420" style="s2">reason I&#39;m incredibly flattered even if</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.170" end="01:55:55.100" style="s2">that isn&#39;t your attention that yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.420" end="01:55:59.210" style="s2">idea that you would have a hard time</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.100" end="01:56:02.480" style="s2">doing that means a lot to me Peter is an</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.210" end="01:56:06.200" style="s2">insanely difficult person for most of us</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.480" end="01:56:09.080" style="s2">to model because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.200" end="01:56:12.920" style="s2">consistent session to session Peter is</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.080" end="01:56:16.010" style="s2">so driven by the search for something</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.920" end="01:56:18.230" style="s2">new that whatever it is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.010" end="01:56:20.990" style="s2">thought lasts is now incorporated into</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.230" end="01:56:23.270" style="s2">well that&#39;s old where do we go from here</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.990" end="01:56:25.310" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s just it&#39;s a constant part of</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.270" end="01:56:26.810" style="s2">the model so I have my own Peter Thiel</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.310" end="01:56:29.330" style="s2">model now you know Peter much much</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.810" end="01:56:31.250" style="s2">better than I do but I think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.330" end="01:56:33.440" style="s2">you really do need to incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.250" end="01:56:36.950" style="s2">everything you know into your current</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.440" end="01:56:38.510" style="s2">view consistently or you&#39;re failing so</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.950" end="01:56:40.070" style="s2">your views should be a kind of random</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.510" end="01:56:42.770" style="s2">walk because if you can predict their</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.070" end="01:56:44.090" style="s2">direction it means you should already be</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.770" end="01:56:45.740" style="s2">where you&#39;re headed and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.090" end="01:56:47.540" style="s2">something wrong if you&#39;re not and the</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.740" end="01:56:49.540" style="s2">other part of my Peter Thiel model is</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.540" end="01:56:52.220" style="s2">the way in which he is an intensely</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.540" end="01:56:53.690" style="s2">moral thinker and how the moral element</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.220" end="01:56:57.080" style="s2">of his thought interacts with the</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.690" end="01:56:58.490" style="s2">cognition and strengthens it and again</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.080" end="01:57:00.860" style="s2">you know Peter better than I do though</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.490" end="01:57:02.690" style="s2">he&#39;s only that&#39;s the only moral human I</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.860" end="01:57:05.780" style="s2">will retreat but that&#39;s how I modeled</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.690" end="01:57:06.950" style="s2">Peter his moral his religious but that</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.780" end="01:57:08.990" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.950" end="01:57:11.090" style="s2">moral and the cognitive are integrated</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.990" end="01:57:13.520" style="s2">you know so I&#39;m picking up on this weird</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.090" end="01:57:16.490" style="s2">feature so I had him as the inaugural</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.520" end="01:57:20.300" style="s2">episode of the interview episode of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.490" end="01:57:22.100" style="s2">show and I would say that one of the one</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.300" end="01:57:24.230" style="s2">of the reactions that people have is wow</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.100" end="01:57:26.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen this side of Peter and</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.230" end="01:57:27.860" style="s2">of course I&#39;ve never seen any others</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.480" end="01:57:29.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen any other side of Peter</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.860" end="01:57:33.200" style="s2">so that the the Delta between the</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.990" end="01:57:34.850" style="s2">private and the cartoon the private</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.200" end="01:57:37.739" style="s2">person in the cartoon character that the</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.850" end="01:57:39.959" style="s2">media portray is got to be</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.739" end="01:57:43.039" style="s2">one of the largest Delta&#39;s I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.959" end="01:57:44.880" style="s2">for any other human being sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.039" end="01:57:48.709" style="s2">anybody else do you think we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.880" end="01:57:52.139" style="s2">wildly wrong if we go by their media</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.709" end="01:57:53.789" style="s2">well most people I think and plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.139" end="01:57:56.189" style="s2">these are people I don&#39;t know but my</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.789" end="01:57:57.749" style="s2">default assumption is if they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.189" end="01:58:00.209" style="s2">well known the media is getting them</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.749" end="01:58:01.739" style="s2">wrong right not true in all cases but</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.209" end="01:58:03.989" style="s2">it&#39;s a better default assumption than</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.739" end="01:58:06.719" style="s2">the opposite so I agree that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.989" end="01:58:09.989" style="s2">true but what I&#39;m looking for is where</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.719" end="01:58:11.849" style="s2">is the distortion most well Charles Koch</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.989" end="01:58:13.550" style="s2">would be an example tell me about</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.849" end="01:58:16.829" style="s2">Charles Koch</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.550" end="01:58:18.840" style="s2">so I have the experience people perceive</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.829" end="01:58:21.380" style="s2">me as being somebody who&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.840" end="01:58:23.489" style="s2">be friendly to the Koch brothers</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.380" end="01:58:25.949" style="s2">certainly the the image of the Koch</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.489" end="01:58:28.320" style="s2">brothers and a lot of people I respect</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.949" end="01:58:30.900" style="s2">think very highly of the Koch brothers</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.320" end="01:58:33.119" style="s2">and I noticed in myself that I have a</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.900" end="01:58:35.459" style="s2">module that says anything Koch related</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.119" end="01:58:37.469" style="s2">has to be seen as the work of the devil</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.459" end="01:58:40.769" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t even have a</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.469" end="01:58:42.719" style="s2">thought before the word Koch starts to</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.769" end="01:58:44.369" style="s2">tell me that this is something I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.719" end="01:58:47.429" style="s2">even entertain which is fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.369" end="01:58:49.559" style="s2">because of my political milieu just</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.429" end="01:58:51.300" style="s2">noticing metacognitively Wow I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.559" end="01:58:53.760" style="s2">install that module where did how did it</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.300" end="01:58:55.469" style="s2">get there just to be clear Koch</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.760" end="01:58:57.300" style="s2">foundation is a major donor to my</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.469" end="01:58:59.670" style="s2">University and programs I&#39;ve connected</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.300" end="01:59:02.579" style="s2">with a Peter has supported some things</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.670" end="01:59:04.999" style="s2">I&#39;ve done just for our listeners Charles</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.579" end="01:59:08.429" style="s2">I think in terms of being an executor an</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.999" end="01:59:11.249" style="s2">integrator and synthesizer is the most</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.429" end="01:59:14.219" style="s2">impressive human I have met as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.249" end="01:59:16.320" style="s2">can tell no kidding that the high</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.219" end="01:59:19.559" style="s2">returns of Koch Industries over such a</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.320" end="01:59:21.599" style="s2">long period of time and it&#39;s not in a</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.559" end="01:59:23.280" style="s2">sector based on a kind of like trick</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.599" end="01:59:24.809" style="s2">well Google obviously has done very well</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.280" end="01:59:27.209" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to call Google a trick no</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.809" end="01:59:29.489" style="s2">net search it&#39;s a kind of natural</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.209" end="01:59:31.530" style="s2">monopoly yeah they&#39;ve done a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.489" end="01:59:35.849" style="s2">job since then and YouTube and all that</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.530" end="01:59:38.010" style="s2">yes but Koch Industries has worked in</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.849" end="01:59:42.079" style="s2">pretty competitive sectors and earned</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.010" end="01:59:44.670" style="s2">high returns through competence and</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.079" end="01:59:46.769" style="s2">execution and understanding and</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.670" end="01:59:49.559" style="s2">developing processes which are</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.769" end="01:59:51.480" style="s2">replicable on a much larger level than</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.559" end="01:59:53.880" style="s2">the individual of Charles Koch or and</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.480" end="01:59:55.800" style="s2">anyone else in a way that all the other</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.880" end="01:59:58.620" style="s2">impressive people we now have not done</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.800" end="02:00:01.020" style="s2">so that is his and their most impressive</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.620" end="02:00:02.970" style="s2">contribution but he is a man of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.020" end="02:00:05.130" style="s2">utmost integrity and to make it clear on</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.970" end="02:00:06.750" style="s2">issues such as climate change I don&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.130" end="02:00:08.880" style="s2">all agree with him but I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.750" end="02:00:10.739" style="s2">Charles for a long time he&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.880" end="02:00:12.720" style="s2">a straight shooter and does what he</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.739" end="02:00:15.630" style="s2">thinks is right and is a great American</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.720" end="02:00:16.710" style="s2">and is very much a person to be admired</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.630" end="02:00:19.350" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.710" end="02:00:22.290" style="s2">and that&#39;s reason enough to invite him</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.350" end="02:00:23.550" style="s2">onto the portal if he if you come and</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.290" end="02:00:25.020" style="s2">there&#39;s you know plenty of things I</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.550" end="02:00:27.150" style="s2">disagree with him about just to make a</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.020" end="02:00:29.550" style="s2">Charlie Munger&#39;s he&#39;s somebody that you</p>

<p begin="02:03:47.489" end="02:03:51.360" style="s2">we should stop with the ex-post purges</p>

<p begin="02:03:57.270" end="02:04:02.849" style="s2">don&#39;t think we figured it out when I</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.969" end="02:04:05.460" style="s2">hear any side in that debate I think oh</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.849" end="02:04:07.170" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong but they can&#39;t all be</p>

<p begin="02:04:09.179" end="02:04:10.980" style="s2">this I&#39;d be curious to get your take on</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.800" end="02:04:13.739" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.980" end="02:04:16.650" style="s2">I think that we Jews should call for the</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.739" end="02:04:18.659" style="s2">destruction of the arch of Titus that</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.650" end="02:04:21.269" style="s2">commemorates the sacking of Jerusalem</p>

<p begin="02:04:24.659" end="02:04:29.550" style="s2">idea being that this is so preposterous</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.260" end="02:04:31.650" style="s2">that we should tear down this ancient</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.550" end="02:04:35.159" style="s2">arch even though you know Jews have</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.650" end="02:04:38.459" style="s2">always hated this arch sure that it will</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.159" end="02:04:42.869" style="s2">evidence to people just how insane it is</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.459" end="02:04:44.099" style="s2">to attempt to you know do this excision</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.869" end="02:04:47.099" style="s2">or exercise I don&#39;t know what you want</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.099" end="02:04:49.159" style="s2">to call it retro actively when we</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.099" end="02:04:51.689" style="s2">obviously have a society built on</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.159" end="02:04:53.369" style="s2">structures of oppression I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.689" end="02:04:55.530" style="s2">it would show people that I don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="02:04:55.530" end="02:04:59.369" style="s2">properly and here&#39;s my worry so you can</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.570" end="02:05:02.039" style="s2">say well we&#39;re gonna have a moratorium</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.369" end="02:05:03.630" style="s2">on canceling people in the past right</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.039" end="02:05:05.699" style="s2">but the past and the present are not so</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.630" end="02:05:07.889" style="s2">neatly separated and there are people</p>

<p begin="02:05:07.889" end="02:05:13.260" style="s2">of the present a number of people in</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.860" end="02:05:15.059" style="s2">comedy but many others who are either</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.260" end="02:05:18.780" style="s2">active or they would be active if they</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.059" end="02:05:20.280" style="s2">would be allowed to be active and in</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.780" end="02:05:23.309" style="s2">those cases I&#39;m not sure what we should</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.280" end="02:05:28.289" style="s2">do do you have a strong feeling on louis</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.309" end="02:05:29.999" style="s2">c.k seems to be the case that a very</p>

<p begin="02:05:29.999" end="02:05:34.050" style="s2">return in a very large number of people</p>

<p begin="02:05:39.150" end="02:05:43.829" style="s2">worse than I thought but the marginal</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.909" end="02:05:46.380" style="s2">cases I tend to believe we should allow</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.829" end="02:05:48.900" style="s2">for rehabilitation in general I believe</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.380" end="02:05:50.880" style="s2">in second third and additional chances</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.900" end="02:05:52.789" style="s2">and it&#39;s striking to me how many people</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.880" end="02:05:55.860" style="s2">in the political debate will be oh</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.789" end="02:05:57.780" style="s2">ex-convicts you know we need to allow</p>

<p begin="02:05:57.780" end="02:06:02.610" style="s2">and welcome the back into society but</p>

<p begin="02:06:25.459" end="02:06:31.829" style="s2">but I understand incentives matter as an</p>

<p begin="02:07:15.659" end="02:07:19.199" style="s2">fruits of all oppression by showing them</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.880" end="02:07:21.929" style="s2">what that would actually mean do you</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.199" end="02:07:23.429" style="s2">think I don&#39;t know but again that the</p>

<p begin="02:07:27.900" end="02:07:31.949" style="s2">doing one in two days with the fellow</p>

<p begin="02:07:31.949" end="02:07:36.780" style="s2">oh I&#39;d love Shaka I haven&#39;t met him yet</p>

<p begin="02:07:46.560" end="02:07:50.820" style="s2">charges and I had to think long and hard</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.139" end="02:07:53.340" style="s2">like should I do a podcast with Jacques</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.820" end="02:07:55.679" style="s2">oh you&#39;re making a great decision and</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.340" end="02:07:57.570" style="s2">that was the conclusion I arrived at but</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.679" end="02:08:00.510" style="s2">it&#39;s still a question right</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.570" end="02:08:02.610" style="s2">no you I found Chaka to be I mean this</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.510" end="02:08:04.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve only it&#39;s very weird I out there</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.610" end="02:08:09.300" style="s2">all these people in my personal and</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.320" end="02:08:11.639" style="s2">private life who are now coming up</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.300" end="02:08:14.219" style="s2">potentially in the context of should I</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.639" end="02:08:16.830" style="s2">have a podcast with them I think Chaka</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.219" end="02:08:19.619" style="s2">you can ask almost any question about</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.830" end="02:08:22.260" style="s2">his time in prison about what the</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.619" end="02:08:23.940" style="s2">transformation has been and I think</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.260" end="02:08:25.860" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a very credible answer I</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.940" end="02:08:27.929" style="s2">thought I found him incredibly</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.860" end="02:08:30.719" style="s2">thoughtful as a theorist about the</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.929" end="02:08:33.540" style="s2">entire system that&#39;s also my sense but</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.719" end="02:08:35.850" style="s2">the question of does the fact that we</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.540" end="02:08:39.300" style="s2">can learn from someone in any way</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.850" end="02:08:41.639" style="s2">exonerate them I would still say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.300" end="02:08:42.960" style="s2">have a clear answer but that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.639" end="02:08:45.080" style="s2">I guess this matters for me at the</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.960" end="02:08:46.910" style="s2">margin for selfish reasons it matters</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.080" end="02:08:49.520" style="s2">I&#39;m really looking forward to talking</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.910" end="02:08:52.100" style="s2">with Shaka but if you try to generalize</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.520" end="02:08:54.800" style="s2">I don&#39;t know where we&#39;re left so let me</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.100" end="02:08:56.660" style="s2">give a really clean example because the</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.800" end="02:08:58.820" style="s2">person is no longer with us and I think</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.660" end="02:09:02.090" style="s2">that the artistic contribution is more</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.820" end="02:09:04.940" style="s2">fascinating than we care to admit have</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.090" end="02:09:06.860" style="s2">you ever heard the song by Charles</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.940" end="02:09:09.260" style="s2">Manson called look at your game girl</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.860" end="02:09:11.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard that there are songs by</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.260" end="02:09:13.220" style="s2">Charles Manson but I&#39;ve never heard it I</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.090" end="02:09:16.090" style="s2">don&#39;t think so I struggle with this</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.220" end="02:09:19.850" style="s2">because it&#39;s an incredibly beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.090" end="02:09:23.690" style="s2">performance to my ear and the human</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.850" end="02:09:26.840" style="s2">being who created it is obviously almost</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.690" end="02:09:28.400" style="s2">synonymous with a level of madness and</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.840" end="02:09:31.610" style="s2">depravity that we wish to insulate</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.400" end="02:09:33.800" style="s2">ourselves from I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.610" end="02:09:39.110" style="s2">reconcile that because I I see the</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.800" end="02:09:40.910" style="s2">sensitivity and the gift and my feeling</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.110" end="02:09:43.580" style="s2">about it as a song if you could just</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.910" end="02:09:46.310" style="s2">disembody it I mean be a great song if</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.580" end="02:09:48.620" style="s2">you actually think about what it is that</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.310" end="02:09:51.170" style="s2">you&#39;re choosing to promote this is not a</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.620" end="02:09:54.590" style="s2">very famous song because of its</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.170" end="02:10:00.460" style="s2">association I think it would be a huge</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.590" end="02:10:04.970" style="s2">disservice if its popularity came to</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.460" end="02:10:07.040" style="s2">have us reevaluate its author when the</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.970" end="02:10:08.420" style="s2">John Lennon song run for your life comes</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.040" end="02:10:11.390" style="s2">on the radio which is a song about</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.420" end="02:10:13.280" style="s2">wife-beating it seems I do actually</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.390" end="02:10:15.620" style="s2">change the channel I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:10:15.620" end="02:10:22.310" style="s2">John Lennon and I don&#39;t want to listen</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.030" end="02:10:24.440" style="s2">are we not entitled to some hypocrisy I</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.310" end="02:10:26.150" style="s2">mean like well I but we need optimal</p>

<p begin="02:10:30.110" end="02:10:36.800" style="s2">really like that cuz I I feel that I</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.640" end="02:10:38.270" style="s2">can&#39;t get through a day without my</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.800" end="02:10:39.980" style="s2">hypocrisy and people are always trying</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.270" end="02:10:43.550" style="s2">to take it away from me and all I really</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.980" end="02:10:45.290" style="s2">want to do is to minimize it and to make</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.550" end="02:10:47.390" style="s2">sure that it&#39;s functional rather than</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.290" end="02:10:49.490" style="s2">just a complete dodge but we also need</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.390" end="02:10:50.990" style="s2">some hypocritical sanctions against</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.490" end="02:10:53.450" style="s2">hypocrisy so there are multiple layers</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.990" end="02:10:55.940" style="s2">so yeah right so you can&#39;t just sit</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.450" end="02:10:57.800" style="s2">content in your hypocracy even if it&#39;s</p>
