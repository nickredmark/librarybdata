<p begin="00:00:12.280" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if any other personality course</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">in North America talks about Binswanger and Boss anymore maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:22.315" style="s2">But I think their ideas are extremely interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:25.400" style="s2">And so I&#39;m going to talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.900" end="00:00:29.580" style="s2">They were influenced very much by Martin Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.740" end="00:00:33.700" style="s2">Who was one of the 20th century&#39;s greatest philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.700" end="00:00:38.200" style="s2">I would say probably - This school of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.200" end="00:00:40.180" style="s2">This part of the phenomenological school</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.300" end="00:00:43.460" style="s2">was more influenced directly by a philosopher than any other school.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.460" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">And just to reiterate because you might keep wondering why</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.880" end="00:00:51.280" style="s2">I discuss so many philosophers in this course</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.280" end="00:00:52.840" style="s2">It&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.140" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">Clinical Psychology in particular is not strictly a scientific enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:04.840" style="s2">It&#39;s because it&#39;s oriented towards values as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.000" end="00:01:07.720" style="s2">And I don&#39;t see that there is any way of getting around that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.100" end="00:01:10.940" style="s2">and that because what you are trying to do as a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.260" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">and perhaps what you&#39;re trying to do with your own life  is to figure out how to live properly</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.480" end="00:01:18.380" style="s2">Now you can construe that as the absence of illness</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.500" end="00:01:24.480" style="s2">Which is - That&#39;s about as close as you get to a scientific model of living well</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">So you don&#39;t have any illnesses</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.180" end="00:01:30.380" style="s2">But even the idea of illness is an idea that&#39;s not precisely scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.860" end="00:01:34.600" style="s2">It&#39;s an amalgam of scientific concepts and ethical concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:35.780" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">There is no escaping it and if you&#39;re in the domain of ethics or values</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.840" end="00:01:43.440" style="s2">Then you&#39;re in what is more or less a philosophical domain</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:48.995" style="s2">But also if you&#39;re a scientist - if you&#39;re a scientist who is interested in personality</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.000" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">It&#39;s also something you have to grapple with conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:55.720" style="s2">Because people live within an ethic and the ethic structures their perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.800" end="00:01:58.480" style="s2">And so even to study human beings as objects</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.480" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">You still have to take into account they ensconce themselves within a value system</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.100" end="00:02:04.840" style="s2">and you have to understand what that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.120" end="00:02:09.900" style="s2">So for me it&#39;s easier and more straightforward just to get right to the root of matter to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.020" end="00:02:12.580" style="s2">and these people also had insanely interesting ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">They&#39;re really useful to know</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.580" end="00:02:17.000" style="s2">And so this, I would say maybe these</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:21.215" style="s2">The philosophy that underpins this might be the most complex of all the philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.220" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">That we&#39;re going to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:29.020" style="s2">And that&#39;s really saying something because there is no shortage of complexities say in Jung</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.100" end="00:02:34.300" style="s2">And it&#39;s very difficult to portray what these people were up to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.900" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">I started by telling you, when we discussed Rogers a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:47.780" style="s2">That the phenomenologists were interested in the fact that people live within a self-defined perceptual world</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.960" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">That might be one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.500" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">Part of the way to start to conceptualize what that means is to consider for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.320" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">just consider for a moment how many things there are in this room that you might look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">and the answer to that is there&#39;s an infinite number of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">Depending on how you&#39;re going to scale your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:13.615" style="s2">You could spend, if you were a painter, you could spend a month painting that tile</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">Painting a representation of that tile because it&#39;s infinitely complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.640" end="00:03:21.800" style="s2">To get the colors right, to get the patterns right, there&#39;s no end to it really</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:24.500" style="s2">Because to make a representation that was accurate</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:29.020" style="s2">It would have to be as detailed as the thing itself and it&#39;s crazily detailed</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.020" end="00:03:30.760" style="s2">But you don&#39;t concentrate on that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:35.580" style="s2">So you think, you&#39;re surrounded by an infinite number of potential things to apprehend</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.800" end="00:03:37.235" style="s2">But that isn&#39;t the world you live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.240" end="00:03:42.580" style="s2">The world you live in is a very very constrained subset of those things</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">And part of the question is then: what&#39;s the nature of that constrained subset</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:49.880" style="s2">That&#39;s what you inhabit that&#39;s what makes up your experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:55.600" style="s2">And also how is it related to the infinitely complex objects that are around you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.800" end="00:03:58.360" style="s2">And that&#39;s really what these people were trying to figure out.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.360" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">So you&#39;re in this perceptual frame, that&#39;s one way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:04.020" style="s2">That&#39;s the Dasein, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.020" end="00:04:08.140" style="s2">That&#39;s the existential frame or the phenomenological frame</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.140" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">Because you can&#39;t think about it merely as perception</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.660" style="s2">Because it contains also, all of the things you experience subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.860" end="00:04:18.140" style="s2">The emotions and the Qualia that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.240" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">You know Qualia is an element of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.700" end="00:04:26.180" style="s2">that say philosophers or scientists of consciouness have a particularly difficult time with.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.360" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">And it&#39;s like - it&#39;s the quality of pain which doesn&#39;t seem reducible to a set of  objective facts</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">Or the quality of color, or the quality of beauty, or the quality of love, or the quality of sorrow</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.200" end="00:04:39.400" style="s2">Those things seem irreducible to some degree in and of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.620" end="00:04:43.420" style="s2">Like what is pain made of? It doesn&#39;t even seem like a reasonable question.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.420" end="00:04:51.140" style="s2">I mean you can say, how do you decompose the neurological circuits that are involved in the experience of pain? Fine.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.300" end="00:04:57.200" style="s2">But to ask what pain consists of or is composed of or what beauty is composed of, or love.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.200" end="00:05:01.760" style="s2">Seems to be -  There is something wrong with the formulation of that question</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.760" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">Because those things sort of manifest them self as raw facts of existence</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.420" end="00:05:10.660" style="s2">And so they&#39;re constituent elements of this - of your field of experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.860" end="00:05:14.500" style="s2">Your phenomenological frame or this Dasein</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.540" end="00:05:18.120" style="s2">Which is the way that Heidegger conceptualized it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:25.700" style="s2">That&#39;s being there with you at the center of your what? Your realm of experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.880" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:05:28.100" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">Now here&#39;s some characteristics of the Dasein</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.760" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">The thing that makes up you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.945" end="00:05:37.515" style="s2">The past and the present are implicit in it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.720" end="00:05:39.420" style="s2">What does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:45.880" style="s2">Well, say you have a particular emotional response to something, maybe it&#39;s a negative emotional response.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:48.860" style="s2">And you see this very frequently with arguments with people</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.000" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">You&#39;re having an argument with someone you love. Like a family member, that&#39;s a good example</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.680" end="00:05:56.540" style="s2">So lets say it&#39;s the same damn fight you&#39;ve had with your mother 50 times</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:00.180" style="s2">Okay that&#39;s interesting because what it means is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:05.480" style="s2">All of those 50 times you&#39;ve fought with your mother are implicit in this fight</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.640" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">So althought it&#39;s taking place right here and now, the past has shaped it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.180" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">And if you wanted to investigate the fight completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.120" end="00:06:18.140" style="s2">You&#39;d have to get to the bottom of that entire train of interactions you&#39;ve had with your mother</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.220" end="00:06:24.780" style="s2">So it&#39;s implicit in your current experience that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.920" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">But the future is implicit in it too because</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.400" end="00:06:34.260" style="s2">What you&#39;re doing right now, it&#39;s as if the future is folded up in what you&#39;re experiencing right now and it unfolds as you interact with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.440" end="00:06:40.100" style="s2">And so the reason it&#39;s conditional to some degree on you and your past is because</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.460" end="00:06:47.740" style="s2">it&#39;s your past and you that are determining the actions that you undertake right now that determine how the future is going to unfold around you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:53.720" style="s2">Now not completely obviously because you don&#39;t have complete control over how things unfold</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.060" end="00:06:59.200" style="s2">But you seem to have some ability to determine how things unfold</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.800" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">So one of the ways I&#39;ve sort of conceptualized the phenomenological viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.180" end="00:07:06.900" style="s2">This is one way of thinking about it I believe is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.940" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">Instead of thinking - It does mean you have to reconceptualize your idea of objects</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.700" end="00:07:16.220" style="s2">Like an object seems like a unidimensional thing in some sense. It&#39;s an object.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.360" end="00:07:19.675" style="s2">But most of the things people interact with aren&#39;t like that at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.675" end="00:07:21.575" style="s2">So like here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">Let&#39;s say you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">Let&#39;s say you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.360" end="00:07:28.480" style="s2">You&#39;re writing the MCAT, you want to go to medical school</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.580" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">You&#39;ve written the MCAT, you get the envelope in the mail, it tells you what your score is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.920" end="00:07:35.760" style="s2">You hold the envelope, what are you holding?</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.060" end="00:07:38.920" style="s2">Well if you think about it from an objective perspective, it&#39;s an envelope</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.920" end="00:07:41.460" style="s2">Who cares? It&#39;s just a little piece of paper right?</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.620" end="00:07:43.920" style="s2">It&#39;s a rectangle of paper</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.100" end="00:07:46.020" style="s2">But that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re holding at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.380" end="00:07:53.260" style="s2">That&#39;s not what that thing is, that&#39;s how you see it. But it&#39;s not what it is at all and you know that. Your body knows that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.400" end="00:07:56.880" style="s2">Because you&#39;re shaking. Well, what are you scared of? The envelope?</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.040" end="00:08:04.780" style="s2">Well the fact that you see it as an envelope is only an indication of just how narrow your perceptions actually are.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.060" end="00:08:07.160" style="s2">Because it&#39;s a portal.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.160" end="00:08:11.460" style="s2">Right? it&#39;s a portal through which you are going to walk into one of two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.620" end="00:08:14.900" style="s2">One in which you&#39;re in medical school and the other in which you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.040" end="00:08:17.760" style="s2">And it also actually contains the past</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.800" end="00:08:22.940" style="s2">Which is really strange because you think, well you already know what the past is. No you don&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.940" end="00:08:28.180" style="s2">Whatever that score is in there determines what your past was and you know that too.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.320" end="00:08:33.520" style="s2">You go watch a movie and a bunch of things happen in the movie and then something twisted happens at the end  and all the sudden (trilling)</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:36.420" style="s2">Everything that you thought about the movie was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.720" end="00:08:39.460" style="s2">and a whole new past for the movie pops into being</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.980" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">Well, are you a pre-med student? A valid pre-med student? Well the score will determine whether or not you were.</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:49.300" style="s2">Very strange, very strange</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:50.900" style="s2">Because you think of the past as fixed</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.180" end="00:08:56.840" style="s2">You know? And you think of the things you&#39;re interacting with as the things that you see and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.180" end="00:09:02.040" style="s2">And you&#39;re body is smarter than that, way smarter than that. Because it responds to, you could say</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:09.400" style="s2">And this is sort of a Rogerian perspective, your body is more likely to respond to what the thing actually is, than how it is that you see it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.720" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">Okay so, the past is implicit in the current being</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">and the future is implicit in the current being</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.760" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">And so the past and the future sort of folded up inside it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.180" end="00:09:22.820" style="s2">And you can unfold them and take a look at them</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.660" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">Now, here&#39;s the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.500" end="00:09:35.140" style="s2">So, from a classic scientific perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.140" end="00:09:39.260" style="s2">There&#39;s the world of independently existing objects and there&#39;s the world of subjects</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">And the subject is really in a secondary relationship to the object</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">Because the objective world is what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:50.860" style="s2">But one of the things that the phenomenologists were concerned about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.020" end="00:09:57.400" style="s2">Is that, well you run into this problem again of exactly how it is that you define the object</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.400" end="00:10:06.300" style="s2">Because, just as the envelope with the scores in it can&#39;t be reduced to the paper,</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:14.280" style="s2">So the object that you&#39;re interacting with only reveals what it is as a consequence of the way that you interact with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.280" end="00:10:18.600" style="s2">So for example if you take a complex object like another person</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.660" end="00:10:24.760" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, what is it that you are. Well a huge part of that is going to depend on exactly how I interact with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:28.680" style="s2">Because you could be a raging beast if I interacted with you one way</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.700" end="00:10:35.460" style="s2">and you could be a perfectly, you know, cooperative entity that was very pleasant if I interacted with you another way</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.580" end="00:10:43.540" style="s2">And so partly what&#39;s happening - you can think of what you&#39;re interacting with as something that&#39;s really multi-faceted. Truly multi-faceted</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:46.900" style="s2">And you say, well you&#39;re trying to determine what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:52.740" style="s2">But the problem is that what it is manifests itself only in accordance with how you behave towards it</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:59.180" style="s2">And it&#39;s actually the case with even objects that you reduce right down to their constituent elements</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.180" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">So you might say like lets talk about subatomic particles. Hypothetically, the most objective thing there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">Well it turns out that whether they&#39;re a wave or a particle depends on the way you set up the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:16.600" style="s2">Now I don&#39;t want to make quantum analogies but what I&#39;m saying is that the object is a very very complicated thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:21.840" style="s2">And so even defining what it is means you have to adopt a frame of reference with regards to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.880" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">And you undertake only some procedures and not others</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.000" end="00:11:29.380" style="s2">So, when you&#39;re defining an object even scientifically you actually don&#39;t define the object.</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.480" end="00:11:36.960" style="s2">What you say is here is a multi-dimensional entity if you approach it in this manner, that&#39;s the procedure, right? The methods.</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.080" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">If you approach it in that manner, it will manifest that set of traits</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.400" end="00:11:45.640" style="s2">But the problem is, is that there&#39;s all sorts of other traits that it could manifest just as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.720" end="00:11:47.700" style="s2">If you treated it a different way</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:55.480" style="s2">And so the object itself is not something that - it&#39;s not something easily reducible to a single set of properties</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.800" end="00:11:59.980" style="s2">I was talking to one of my students yesterday, he had a pretty smart thing to say about images.</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.020" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">We were talking about deep images you know the sorts that you might see in a really high quality museum</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">So maybe they&#39;re I don&#39;t know 15th century or 16th century renaissance  masterpieces</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.500" end="00:12:14.840" style="s2">They&#39;re inexhaustible to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:19.460" style="s2">Which is why they&#39;re in museums and people go look at them you know decade after decade</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">And it&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:24.700" style="s2">Every time you look at them you&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.900" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">You go in one week, you look at it, you see something. You go in the next week, you look at it and you see something else.</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:31.420" style="s2">Well it&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.520" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">You&#39;re bringing something entirely different to the situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.080" end="00:12:43.000" style="s2">and the image is complicated enough to allow it to reflect something new to you depening on the stance you take in relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:44.740" style="s2">And lots of things are like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.740" end="00:12:46.040" style="s2">lots of things are like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.080" end="00:12:50.940" style="s2">A book you read when you were sixteen is going to be an entirely different book when you read it when you&#39;re 35</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.980" end="00:12:55.340" style="s2">Say well the book&#39;s the same. It&#39;s like, it depends on how you define the book</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.800" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">Because it isn&#39;t even obvious where the book is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:00.540" style="s2">Well it&#39;s on my shelf in the library</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2">It&#39;s like no, that&#39;s a chunk of paper that&#39;s on your shelf in the library</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">Where exactly the book is, that&#39;s a much more difficult question to consider</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:13.340" style="s2">So it depends on how you define the book</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:19.060" style="s2">So without a subject, nothing at all would exist to confront objects and to imagine them as such</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.340" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">True this implies that every object</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:28.020" style="s2">Everything objective in being merely objectified by the subject is the most subjective thing possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.020" end="00:13:30.940" style="s2">Well you also know this again when you&#39;re in an argument with someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.940" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">&quot;it&#39;s you&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.720" end="00:13:32.740" style="s2">&quot;no, it&#39;s you&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.780" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">&quot;no it&#39;s you&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.720" end="00:13:35.540" style="s2">It&#39;s like, you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.720" end="00:13:39.400" style="s2">Are you being biased? Are you looking at the situation incorrectly?</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.400" end="00:13:43.960" style="s2">The person you&#39;re arguing with trying to convince you that it&#39;s your problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.960" end="00:13:46.200" style="s2">You think &quot;no you made me angry&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.340" end="00:13:51.560" style="s2">It&#39;s like hmm an interesting statement you know? as if you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.640" end="00:13:54.140" style="s2">But it does seem that way, you were being provocative</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.140" end="00:13:56.260" style="s2">&quot;Well you&#39;re just too sensitive&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:13:58.380" style="s2">&quot;hmm how are we going to settle that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.920" end="00:14:09.940" style="s2">Well it&#39;s a continual argument and that again has to do with the crazy entangled dynamic between subjective perception and objective perception</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.820" end="00:14:16.795" style="s2">I&#39;ve showed you this before and I actually think this is a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.795" end="00:14:20.145" style="s2">Schematic representation of what&#39;s meant by Dasein</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.145" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">And this is a complicated little diagram</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.760" end="00:14:25.840" style="s2">Although the diagram itself is quite simple</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.140" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">It&#39;s predicated on the following assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.360" end="00:14:32.520" style="s2">You need to narrow down your world</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.860" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">and what you&#39;re doing is narrowing it down from lets say an infinite set of possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:39.820" style="s2">To a finite set of manageable possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.820" end="00:14:41.560" style="s2">and you do that a bunch of ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.740" end="00:14:46.680" style="s2">Partly - merely - you can&#39;t your senses aren&#39;t acute enough to detect everything.</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:52.080" style="s2">So pure stupidity in some sense stops you from being absolutely overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.080" end="00:14:57.400" style="s2">You don&#39;t have eyes in the back of your head for example so you don&#39;t have to worry about all those things you&#39;re not looking at behind you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.460" end="00:14:59.640" style="s2">But then it&#39;s far more than that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.640" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">You just can&#39;t handle that full complexity so there&#39;s a continual narrowing process</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:06.780" style="s2">And then you exist inside that narrowed reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.840" end="00:15:08.540" style="s2">Like if I look at you like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.380" end="00:15:13.780" style="s2">There&#39;s not a hell of a lot of difference between that looking at you like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.540" style="s2">Like I can&#39;t really see these people. I can tell they&#39;re people, that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.540" end="00:15:19.000" style="s2">I can see your face</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.420" end="00:15:22.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve got just about all of it right there</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:25.480" style="s2">That&#39;s a very narrow and you know you&#39;re moving your eyes around</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.640" end="00:15:28.635" style="s2">and inhabiting this constant narrow space</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.640" end="00:15:33.720" style="s2">Well what&#39;s that space - what does that space you inhabit consist of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.840" end="00:15:36.920" style="s2">Well that&#39;s Dasein that space that you inhabit and so we can say</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.980" end="00:15:38.340" style="s2">It&#39;s something like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.340" end="00:15:43.560" style="s2">You have implicit in that perception a sense of where you are and what you are doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.560" end="00:15:44.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in the perception</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.900" end="00:15:48.660" style="s2">and then in the perception as well is what you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.780" style="s2">Because you&#39;re not just sitting here passively or you&#39;d be asleep or you&#39;d be unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.820" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">You&#39;re sitting here doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">You know, physically</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.380" end="00:16:00.100" style="s2">But you have an aim in mind and the aim is what you&#39;re pointing your eyes at</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:02.640" style="s2">The aim is what&#39;s structuring your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:09.740" style="s2">The aim is what&#39;s revealing that part of the world that is being revealed to you, to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:12.120" style="s2">That&#39;s the revelation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.180" end="00:16:15.540" style="s2">It also structures your emotions. It also primes your behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.620" end="00:16:18.440" style="s2">So it&#39;s not a drive, it&#39;s not a goal</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.580" end="00:16:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not a motivation, it&#39;s more than that. It&#39;s all of that at once.</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.765" end="00:16:25.585" style="s2">That&#39;s sort of what your personality is</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.900" end="00:16:28.580" style="s2">You see the phenomenologists don&#39;t really think about personality</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.600" end="00:16:32.035" style="s2">They think about the manifestation of your reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.040" end="00:16:34.040" style="s2">It&#39;s not exactly your personality</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.200" end="00:16:38.840" style="s2">It&#39;s that you&#39;re the center of a reality and you constitute that reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.160" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">But all of your elements of experience constitute that reality and so it&#39;s simplest element is something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.940" end="00:16:52.300" style="s2">Where you are and where you&#39;re going and the embodied actions you undertake to relate those two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.300" end="00:16:56.980" style="s2">Which would include your eye movements because of course perception is an active phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.060" end="00:17:00.100" style="s2">You are shaking your eyes back and forth unbelievable rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:05.740" style="s2">Otherwise, if you can make your eyes stand still, which you can do with great concentration</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.740" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">Everything will black out</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:14.320" style="s2">Because you have to move your eyes back and forth so the light hits different cells cause the cells get exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.440" end="00:17:21.000" style="s2">And then they stop reporting. So you&#39;re just whipping your eyes back and forth in a micro-way constantly</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.140" end="00:17:24.580" style="s2">And as well as moving them around voluntarily and involuntarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.080" end="00:17:29.220" style="s2">So even perception is a lot more like feeling things out with your fingers</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.340" end="00:17:31.420" style="s2">Even when you&#39;re using your ears or your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.475" end="00:17:34.165" style="s2">It&#39;s very active, there&#39;s no passive perception</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.165" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a motor act to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.340" end="00:17:40.900" style="s2">and so your motor act is determined by your hierarchy of values that&#39;s one way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:46.095" style="s2">So another way of thinking about it is that&#39;s how the past and future are implicit in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.100" end="00:17:50.180" style="s2">Your very active perception is determined by your entire value structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.180" end="00:17:50.700" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.015" end="00:17:54.365" style="s2">It&#39;s implicit inside of it, it&#39;s folded up inside of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.700" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">You can tell that too because if something violates it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">Again, maybe an argument with someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.920" end="00:18:05.260" style="s2">It&#39;s good to think about people as the thing you interact with the most as the canonical object</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.260" end="00:18:10.600" style="s2">Cause they&#39;re so damn complicated and they get in the way all the time and when someone gets in the way of what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.620" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">You know, it isn&#39;t obvious what they&#39;re interfering with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:17.660" style="s2">It might be the little micro-routine that you&#39;re undertaking right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.900" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">You know, maybe you go home and you make a nice dinner and the person you&#39;re making it for is all rude about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.745" end="00:18:25.815" style="s2">Okay so what exactly are they getting in the way of?</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.135" end="00:18:27.135" style="s2">Well</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.920" end="00:18:34.820" style="s2">They&#39;re certainly getting in the way of your expectations of having a nice emotional time for the next hour</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.420" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">But you have no idea how indicative that is of some serious flaw</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.940" end="00:18:43.675" style="s2">In you, or them, or the relationship, or the situation, or the way you&#39;ve conducted your whole life</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.675" end="00:18:45.975" style="s2">Or the way they&#39;ve conducted their whole life</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.540" end="00:18:48.120" style="s2">and all of that&#39;s packed in there</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:51.260" style="s2">It&#39;s sort of like the unconscious of the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.460" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s more - it&#39;s not the same conceptualization. It&#39;s another way of looking at the same phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:18:58.360" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:03.100" style="s2">Alright so the two people we&#39;re going to talk about most are Medard Boss</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:07.180" style="s2">And he was influenced by Martin Heidegger, who was a great philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:13.540" style="s2">Taken to task often because he turned out to be tangled up with the Nazis more than he should&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.680" end="00:19:19.180" style="s2">And Husserl, that&#39;s Edmund Husserl, who was actually if I remember correctly was Martin Heidegger&#39;s teacher</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.220" end="00:19:21.500" style="s2">That&#39;s Ludwig Binswanger - and they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.505" end="00:19:24.925" style="s2">Both of these two people were influenced both by Freud and Jung</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.820" end="00:19:29.240" style="s2">Okay so here is one of Binswanger&#39;s claims</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">I love this claim it&#39;s such a cool idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">And I think there is neurological support for it. Neuropsychological support</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:40.360" style="s2">What we perceive are &quot;first and foremost&quot; not impressions of taste, tone, smell or touch</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.060" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">Not even in things or objects, but meanings</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:45.615" style="s2">Well that&#39;s an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.620" end="00:19:46.440" style="s2">Because</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:53.980" style="s2">You know it&#39;s been said that every person in an unconscious exponent of some great philosopher&#39;s presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.240" end="00:19:59.400" style="s2">Well, mostly the way you think about the way you perceive is that there are objects in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:00.740" style="s2">You see the objects</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.760" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">You think about the objects, you evaluate the objects</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.240" end="00:20:05.940" style="s2">You decide how to act on the objects, and then you act</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.340" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">Right? it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.500" end="00:20:12.620" style="s2">Object, sense, perception, emotion, cognition, action</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.740" end="00:20:15.580" style="s2">That&#39;s wrong. That isn&#39;t how it works</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.820" end="00:20:17.900" style="s2">It&#39;s partly not the way it works because</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:22.020" style="s2">You&#39;re actually - the way that you interact with the world exists at multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.020" end="00:20:23.080" style="s2">So for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.180" end="00:20:26.580" style="s2">You have reflexes so if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.800" end="00:20:31.900" style="s2">If I poke you hard, you&#39;ll react like that. You&#39;ll jerk back</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.020" end="00:20:33.960" style="s2">And that, you do that without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.960" end="00:20:40.160" style="s2">That&#39;s part of a neurological circuit that&#39;s very deeply embedded and that&#39;s virtually automatic</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.160" end="00:20:43.340" style="s2">It&#39;s reflexive. It doesn&#39;t require conscious perception at all</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.540" end="00:20:45.500" style="s2">It&#39;s too slow for starters</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">And so you have - there&#39;s multiple levels of you interacting with the world.</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.520" style="s2">And at one level, you&#39;re seeing objects, you&#39;re thinking about them, you&#39;re planning what to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.620" end="00:21:00.600" style="s2">But you&#39;re doing all sorts of other things that are way faster than that and other things that are way slower at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.860" end="00:21:03.640" style="s2">Now what Binswanger claims</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.980" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">Is that what you see in the world are meanings</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.460" end="00:21:11.960" style="s2">So it&#39;s the meaning detection first and the object recognition second</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.100" end="00:21:14.120" style="s2">Now that&#39;s a hell of a claim, that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.120" end="00:21:16.780" style="s2">But there&#39;s definitely levels of your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.800" end="00:21:18.660" style="s2">That operate in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.660" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">So for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:22.520" style="s2">Here&#39;s a good example, people have blind sight</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.780" end="00:21:26.580" style="s2">There visual cortex is damaged they can&#39;t see objects</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.620" end="00:21:27.880" style="s2">So they think they&#39;re blind</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.980" end="00:21:34.140" style="s2">But if you show them an angry face, they&#39;ll manifest a change in the skin conductants, They&#39;ll orient</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.360" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">And it means that the eyes are still mapping the face onto the amygdala</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.020" end="00:21:43.780" style="s2">And the amygdala is mapping the pattern onto the body, no object perception</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.860" end="00:21:44.740" style="s2">Pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.900" end="00:21:45.660" style="s2">Pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">Pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.800" end="00:21:48.280" style="s2">No object perception</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.460" end="00:21:53.260" style="s2">And so the meaning is what&#39;s being perceived first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.380" end="00:21:57.320" style="s2">And you have to perceive meanings first because you actually want to stay alive</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.620" end="00:21:58.780" style="s2">That&#39;s the trick</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.940" end="00:22:04.120" style="s2">So the world is full of these things that have meanings to you that are relevant to your survival</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">And what you&#39;re perceiving first is the relevance of the pattern to your survival</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.400" end="00:22:12.405" style="s2">And the idea that you can conceptualize that as a set of objects</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.405" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">Well first of all, that&#39;s a pretty new idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:17.480" style="s2">Technically speaking, right? Because</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.940" end="00:22:25.480" style="s2">Technically speaking we didn&#39;t really start to conceive the world as subject in an objective world until we really formalized science</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.580" end="00:22:28.980" style="s2">Now science was implicit long before it became explicit</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.040" end="00:22:32.340" style="s2">But it didn&#39;t become explicit until about 500 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.540" end="00:22:34.620" style="s2">So you react to meanings</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.620" end="00:22:35.920" style="s2">So here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.060" end="00:22:37.580" style="s2">Babies</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.740" end="00:22:38.600" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.940" end="00:22:41.880" style="s2">If you have two surfaces and you put a piece of glass between them</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.920" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">You know, they&#39;re elevated</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.140" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">And you put an 8 month year old baby on the one surface so they can crawl</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.140" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">It won&#39;t crawl across the space</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.460" end="00:22:56.060" style="s2">And you might say it sees a hole and won&#39;t crawl across it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:58.820" style="s2">But that isn&#39;t what it sees. It sees a place to fall off</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.900" end="00:23:02.020" style="s2">Direct, that&#39;s direct perception</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.020" end="00:23:03.900" style="s2">So when I see this for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.280" end="00:23:07.720" style="s2">My eyes see that as a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.960" end="00:23:11.700" style="s2">That pattern&#39;s on my retina it&#39;s propagated through my optic nerve</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.700" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">It&#39;s propagated into my brain, it&#39;s propagated onto my motor cortex</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.940" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">And the propagation is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:18.440" style="s2">This</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.665" end="00:23:19.665" style="s2">That</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.060" end="00:23:21.780" style="s2">Right? So I can pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">And as soon as - when I look at that this is implicit</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.140" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">That&#39;s implicit in the perception</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:31.860" style="s2">You think well why do you see that at the size and resolution you see it at?</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.120" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">That&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.885" end="00:23:36.975" style="s2">So the fact that you see it that way has this implicit in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.975" end="00:23:39.865" style="s2">It isn&#39;t that you see the object and match your hand to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.865" end="00:23:43.580" style="s2">It&#39;s that matching your hand to it is part of the perception of the object</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.580" end="00:23:45.220" style="s2">It&#39;s what gives the object meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:48.580" style="s2">And so you see actually you perceive the meaning of the object</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.660" end="00:23:50.200" style="s2">It&#39;s part of the perception</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">And you can&#39;t not see the meaning of the object</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.020" end="00:23:58.600" style="s2">Well if you&#39;re a scientist you can sort of separate out the object from its meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.600" end="00:24:00.180" style="s2">That&#39;s actually what science does</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">It tears the object away from its meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.080" end="00:24:05.340" style="s2">And then of course there is nothing meaningful left</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.460" end="00:24:09.940" style="s2">So science ends up value free. But that&#39;s because the meaning has been torn out of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.060" end="00:24:11.980" style="s2">Now there&#39;s technical reasons for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.980" end="00:24:16.580" style="s2">But Binswanger&#39;s point is don&#39;t kid yourself you see the meaning first. Here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:19.280" style="s2">You watch the trade towers fall</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">What did you see?</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.140" end="00:24:24.380" style="s2">Well you could say you saw the towers fall</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">It&#39;s like why are you in shock for two days afterwards then?</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.560" end="00:24:31.340" style="s2">Well because what are the towers exactly?</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">As long as they&#39;re standing and operating, they&#39;re towers.</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.900" end="00:24:37.740" style="s2">As soon as they fall, God only knows what they are</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.740" end="00:24:40.035" style="s2">Maybe they&#39;re the beginning of the next war</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.035" end="00:24:43.045" style="s2">You know? Who knows what they are?</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.220" end="00:24:45.500" style="s2">And so everyone was in shock for three days</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:50.180" style="s2">Because what they saw was the indeterminate meaning of that event</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">And it opened all sorts of gateways</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.680" end="00:24:56.140" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, the towers fell, there&#39;s gateways open everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.180" end="00:24:59.900" style="s2">We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next. We don&#39;t know where we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.060" end="00:25:04.040" style="s2">And that&#39;s direct perception mapped onto your body. Bang, you&#39;re in shock</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.060" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">You see the meaning first</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.920" end="00:25:09.020" style="s2">And well you constrain it down to well why are you so upset?</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.060" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">Well the towers fell</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">It&#39;s like that&#39;s the best you can do for a verbal utterance</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.280" end="00:25:15.580" style="s2">It&#39;s what your perceptual systems reported to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.640" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">But God only knows what happened</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.140" end="00:25:22.160" style="s2">We still don&#39;t really know what it meant that they fell</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.280" end="00:25:25.380" style="s2">Now most things have put themselves back together but</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.100" end="00:25:30.020" style="s2">And then you think well what does it mean?</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.160" end="00:25:32.900" style="s2">What does it mean that what you see first is the meaning?</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.020" end="00:25:36.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really tricky question because you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.560" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">That&#39;s when you get back to the problem of what constitutes real</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.380" end="00:25:44.660" style="s2">So I could say well you&#39;ve evolved to see the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.160" end="00:25:46.300" style="s2">Well then we might ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.300" end="00:25:49.940" style="s2">Well if you&#39;ve evoled to see the meaning and that&#39;s kept you alive</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.960" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">Is there anything more real than the meaning?</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.395" end="00:25:55.405" style="s2">Because somebody who is a materialist would say &quot;well no, the object is more real&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.405" end="00:25:57.980" style="s2">It&#39;s like no, it depends on how you define real</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">It might be that the most real thing about the visual cliff is that that&#39;s a falling off place</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">And that its secondary description as a you know an object</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">A hole or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.440" end="00:26:12.520" style="s2">That&#39;s something you paint over the top of the primary reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.920" end="00:26:13.920" style="s2">And so,</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.020" end="00:26:20.680" style="s2">Well here&#39;s a practical application of it or at least one of the things I think is practical</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.680" end="00:26:26.180" style="s2">You know, you can have experiences that differ in their, lets call it, high quality meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.300" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">You know so you get engaged and engrossed in something and you&#39;re happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:30.780" style="s2">It&#39;s not that you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.780" end="00:26:33.560" style="s2">It&#39;s that you&#39;re engaged and engrossed in it, you would do it again</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:35.960" style="s2">Even though it might take effort</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.980" end="00:26:38.740" style="s2">You can tell that where you are is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.840" end="00:26:41.720" style="s2">Well I think what happens in that situation is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.060" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">You&#39;re in a Piagetian place</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.020" end="00:26:49.640" style="s2">Where many of the games that you&#39;re playing are stacked sort of isomorphically on top of one another</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.640" end="00:26:54.115" style="s2">And the experience of meaning is the fact that you&#39;re playing a small game properly</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.120" end="00:26:56.980" style="s2">Nested inside a larger game, you&#39;re playing it properly</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.020" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">Nested inside a larger game, you&#39;re playing it properly too, etc all the way out</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.400" end="00:27:05.640" style="s2">Past is balanced, future is balanced everything is stacked up</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.800" end="00:27:11.280" style="s2">And there&#39;s a report coming from your being telling you that, that&#39;s why you&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.620" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">You might say well maybe that&#39;s real. Maybe it&#39;s more real than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:21.700" style="s2">That&#39;s a strange thing because if you think that meaning is separate and secondary from the real objective world</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.800" end="00:27:23.980" style="s2">Then the reality is the object</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:27.700" style="s2">But it isn&#39;t obvious that the reality is the object</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:30.820" style="s2">It&#39;s certainly not how we act</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.820" end="00:27:32.660" style="s2">It&#39;s not how we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.315" end="00:27:34.365" style="s2">And so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.080" end="00:27:39.240" style="s2">Did we evolve to perceive reality? It depends on what you mean by perceive</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.240" end="00:27:46.860" style="s2">Perceive might mean did we evolve mechanisms that allowed us to survive in the face of that reality. Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.080" end="00:27:51.180" style="s2">Is that whats real? What enables you to survive in the face of reality?</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.735" end="00:27:53.145" style="s2">It&#39;s a definition</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.675" end="00:27:57.055" style="s2">It&#39;s a perfectly reasonable definition unless you can come up with a better one</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.055" end="00:27:59.045" style="s2">Meanings are primary</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:03.260" style="s2">Now that brings up a strange issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.260" end="00:28:06.295" style="s2">So what determines the meaning of what it is you&#39;re perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.300" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">Well this is where Binswanger and Boss disagree</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.100" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">Binswanger says</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">It&#39;s the a-priori ontological structure. The world design, or matrix of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.340" end="00:28:20.020" style="s2">Okay so what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">Well, you have a particular history. Biological and cultural and individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.900" end="00:28:31.720" style="s2">And you&#39;re viewing the world through the lense of that set of particularities</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.740" end="00:28:36.100" style="s2">So it&#39;s almost if you are behind a curtain and the curtain has certain hoels in it</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.100" end="00:28:39.000" style="s2">And you can see through the wholes in the curtain</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:45.500" style="s2">but the curtain is your construction so the curtain with the holes determines what you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.540" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">Well, Boss would say no it&#39;s the opposite in a very strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.160" end="00:28:55.460" style="s2">The meaning of the world manifests itself to you more or less of its own accord</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.705" end="00:28:56.705" style="s2">And</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.305" end="00:28:59.445" style="s2">It&#39;s a tougher one to explain</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.180" end="00:29:04.500" style="s2">Disclosure of meaning: Boss the revelation of the object</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.600" end="00:29:07.720" style="s2">The emergence of the phenomena: the numinous</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.720" end="00:29:11.000" style="s2">The very word phenomena is derived from phainesthai</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:15.660" style="s2">To shine forth, to appear,  to unveil itself, to come out of concealment or darkness</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.680" end="00:29:18.680" style="s2">Okay here&#39;s an example you see someone beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.575" end="00:29:21.405" style="s2">Is it your perception</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.315" end="00:29:25.125" style="s2">is it your perception or does the beauty exist?</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:28.300" style="s2">That&#39;s the difference between Binswanger and Boss</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:33.980" style="s2">Cause Binswanger would say well the reason that thing appears to you as beautiful is because of the way you&#39;re filtering it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">And Boss would say no</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:42.020" style="s2">The beauty inheres in the object itself and manifests itself. It shines forth</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.280" end="00:29:46.280" style="s2">And so I really like this concept this concept of phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.280" end="00:29:47.800" style="s2">That&#39;s why they&#39;re phenomenologists</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.860" end="00:29:49.680" style="s2">phainesthai means to shine forth</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.780" end="00:29:54.680" style="s2">From the phenomenological perspective you pursue those things that shine forth</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:00.580" style="s2">Now you remember this is kind of a parallel idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:03.140" style="s2">I suppose it&#39;s a parallel of Jungian ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.260" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">You remember in Harry Potter that when they&#39;re playing Quidditch he&#39;s always chasing the snitch?</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.565" end="00:30:10.795" style="s2">And you remember how, if I&#39;ve got this correctly,</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.940" end="00:30:16.300" style="s2">Quidditch is basically two games at the same time right? There&#39;s the standard game and there&#39;s the game that the seekers play</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.360" end="00:30:18.180" style="s2">Yes? I&#39;ve got that right?</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.180" end="00:30:20.180" style="s2">What happens if the seeker gets the snitch?</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:23.160" style="s2">Games over right? They win</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.340" end="00:30:27.820" style="s2">Very interesting. She has a brilliant imagination that woman, Rowling</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:32.840" style="s2">So the idea is that in every game there&#39;s two games going on at the same time. There&#39;s the ordinary game</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.840" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">And there&#39;s the game that the seekers play and the seekers chase the thing that shines at them</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.660" end="00:30:41.480" style="s2">And that&#39;s what that little thing is the snitch. It&#39;s a round circle with wings.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.480" end="00:30:44.460" style="s2">It&#39;s a very very old old old symbol</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.460" end="00:30:46.020" style="s2">It&#39;s a symbol of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.020" end="00:30:51.180" style="s2">It&#39;s a symbol of reality before it&#39;s fractionated into its parts</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.180" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to say it any more clearly than that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.540" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">It&#39;s a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:55.980" style="s2">It&#39;s a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.980" end="00:30:59.080" style="s2">Imagine that there are things that move forward to make you curious</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.400" end="00:31:04.100" style="s2">And you were trying to figure out what was common among all the things that made you curious</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.280" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">That thing that Harry Potter&#39;s chasing, that&#39;s a symbol of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:12.620" style="s2">It&#39;s golden like the sun, it flits around and attracts your attention and it&#39;s always moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">And if you&#39;re seeking, you chase it.</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:19.040" style="s2">So that&#39;s the phenomenological idea, that&#39;s the disclosure of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.040" end="00:31:23.320" style="s2">You say well when you&#39;re curious about something, why are you curious about that?</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:28.160" style="s2">Is it calling to you? Or is it something that you&#39;re interpreting?</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">Well I would say it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the way to resolve this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:33.960" style="s2">It&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.960" end="00:31:37.060" style="s2">There isn&#39;t a perceiving entity without a structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.460" end="00:31:41.860" style="s2">And your structure has been evolving itself for three and a half billion years</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.860" end="00:31:44.440" style="s2">There&#39;s no perceiving entity without a structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.540" end="00:31:47.780" style="s2">But by the same token the thing that&#39;s being perceived</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.780" end="00:31:51.560" style="s2">Also shines forth with its own potential manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.580" end="00:31:54.360" style="s2">And you need to think of it both ways at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.520" end="00:31:57.720" style="s2">But the curiosity issue is a really fascinating one</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.920" end="00:32:00.740" style="s2">Because curiosity pulls you forward</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.860" end="00:32:02.280" style="s2">It&#39;s not random</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.360" end="00:32:03.900" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.900" end="00:32:07.220" style="s2">You can&#39;t really control it, but it&#39;s not random</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.260" end="00:32:09.520" style="s2">If your curiosity is random, you&#39;re schizophrenic</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.700" end="00:32:11.180" style="s2">And I mean that technically</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.280" end="00:32:18.160" style="s2">Because one of the things that happens to schziphrenics is that the mechanisms that establish relevance become pathologized</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.160" end="00:32:20.160" style="s2">And they see meaning everywhere, randomly</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.160" end="00:32:22.620" style="s2">And that&#39;s partly why they generate delusions</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.660" end="00:32:28.260" style="s2">Because the incoherent manifestation of meaning calls out for a representation</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.260" end="00:32:31.780" style="s2">They develop a paranoid delusion if they&#39;re intelligent enough to put everything together</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:35.255" style="s2">So you&#39;re curious and something pulls you forward</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.260" end="00:32:40.860" style="s2">Well you can interact with the curiosity  and you can follow it but you can&#39;t really direct it</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">The question is where is it taking you?</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:47.160" style="s2">So that little ball, that was a manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.160" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">Of what the Greeks referred to - Greeks? Is that right? - Mercurius</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.680" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">It&#39;s a Roman and Greek God Mercurius</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:32:58.280" style="s2">The spirit Mercurius is the messenger of the Gods. The winged messenger of the Gods</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.300" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">It flits around</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.800" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">You say well the curiosity pulls you forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:03.380" style="s2">To where?</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.380" end="00:33:05.940" style="s2">Well to wherever it wants to take you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.220" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">Well that&#39;s a Jungian idea as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">Is that your curiosity is like the manifestation of your self to the ego</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.300" end="00:33:18.740" style="s2">Right? It&#39;s the thing that you could be in the future calling you forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.780" end="00:33:19.900" style="s2">Something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:21.400" style="s2">Very strange idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.400" end="00:33:25.495" style="s2">Very interesting. See when you start to understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.500" end="00:33:29.520" style="s2">That you&#39;re not in control of what makes you interested in things</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.620" end="00:33:31.320" style="s2">The whole world shifts around on you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.320" end="00:33:36.260" style="s2">Because the question is if you&#39;re not in control of that, what the hell is directing it?</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.580" end="00:33:38.060" style="s2">What&#39;s going on?</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.060" end="00:33:39.340" style="s2">It&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.340" end="00:33:41.160" style="s2">It&#39;s not under your control</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.340" end="00:33:44.460" style="s2">It&#39;s not random. It&#39;s alive. It&#39;s dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.500" end="00:33:46.820" style="s2">It has an orientation towards something</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.900" end="00:33:48.440" style="s2">That&#39;s the Jungian self.</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.520" end="00:33:50.780" style="s2">Or that&#39;s the manifestation of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.780" end="00:33:52.100" style="s2">Yes very strange</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.220" end="00:33:54.560" style="s2">I told you this already</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.560" end="00:33:59.580" style="s2">See there&#39;s an old representation, a very old represenation of the snitch right there</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:02.280" style="s2">Now this is an old symbol, eh?</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.280" end="00:34:04.280" style="s2">You&#39;ve got this dragon of chaos here</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.700" end="00:34:06.040" style="s2">It&#39;s kind of like an octopus as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.040" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">That twist in its tail refers to infinity. Dragons almost always have an infinite tail like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:14.580" style="s2">And it&#39;s got the claws of a bird, maybe a bird of prey</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.580" end="00:34:17.160" style="s2">The body of an animal and the head of a snake</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.695" end="00:34:19.025" style="s2">And then down here</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.025" end="00:34:23.600" style="s2">You see its got the sun up there so it&#39;s sort of aiming upwards towards the sun this thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.740" end="00:34:27.940" style="s2">And then down here is this thing called the round chaos. It&#39;s an old alchemical system</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.960" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">And if you look the dragon is fertilizing this</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.395" end="00:34:33.935" style="s2">And that has potential in it like an egg</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.325" end="00:34:35.865" style="s2">It&#39;s full of potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:40.680" style="s2">And so it&#39;s matter and spirit at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.220" end="00:34:45.620" style="s2">It&#39;s sort of like it&#39;s a representation of that which you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.620" end="00:34:47.640" style="s2">Because you could say well the thing that you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.640" end="00:34:49.320" style="s2">It&#39;s sort of a constructivist idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.320" end="00:34:51.160" style="s2">You explore something new</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:53.420" style="s2">What do you generate from the exploration?</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.540" end="00:34:57.360" style="s2">You. Because as you explore it you learn things. That changes you.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.360" end="00:35:00.520" style="s2">So you generate psyche out of the exploration. That&#39;s spirit.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.760" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">And you also generate the world out of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:06.435" style="s2">But the thing to begin with is psyche and world at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:08.180" style="s2">And that&#39;s what this thing represents</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.220" end="00:35:10.060" style="s2">And that&#39;s what Harry Potter is chasing</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.380" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">That&#39;s what makes him a seeker</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.380" end="00:35:14.660" style="s2">Very strange ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.740" end="00:35:16.040" style="s2">Now I&#39;m going to tell you a dream</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.040" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">There was a dream I had while working on these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:20.840" style="s2">And I&#39;m going to tell you the dream for two reasons</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.840" end="00:35:23.700" style="s2">One is because it bears directly on these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.700" end="00:35:29.140" style="s2">Two because well we just covered psychoanalytic thought and I want to show you how a dream can work</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:33.475" style="s2">Cause it&#39;s not easy to find a dream that you can interpret in a way that&#39;s public that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.475" end="00:35:36.475" style="s2">Cause they&#39;re usually so tightly defined contextually</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:40.980" style="s2">You can define them in the therapeutic context because you know so much about the person</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:44.915" style="s2">It&#39;s very hard to pull that out and make it meaningful outside of that context</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.920" end="00:35:46.440" style="s2">But this dream works. Ok so,</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:47.820" style="s2">I was dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.380" end="00:35:53.000" style="s2">I was dreaming that there was a small object. It was a circle, a sphere about this big.</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.420" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">And it was floating on top of the Atlantic Ocean</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.540" end="00:36:00.620" style="s2">And I had kind of a birds eye view of it and I was following it along</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.620" end="00:36:03.800" style="s2">Like maybe you know like a drone would follow behind an object</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.860" end="00:36:05.140" style="s2">And it was floating</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.140" end="00:36:08.540" style="s2">And it was really zipping along man, it was really really fast</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.540" end="00:36:10.620" style="s2">And then the scene shifted</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.620" end="00:36:15.500" style="s2">To a bunch of scientists they were sitting inside a room full of television monitors</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.560" end="00:36:17.860" style="s2">And they were watching this thing move across the Ocean</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.880" end="00:36:24.460" style="s2">And so it was here and it had four hurricanes beside it one here, one here, one here, and one here</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.460" end="00:36:26.500" style="s2">So it was in the center of four hurricanes</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.500" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">So whatever it was was like some bloody potent thing zipping across the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.000" end="00:36:36.680" style="s2">Then the scientists got a hold of it I guess and the scene shifted</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.680" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">And I was in a museum like an old Victorian museum</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.120" end="00:36:43.500" style="s2">And this thing, this ball was now inside a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.560" end="00:36:46.260" style="s2">Imagine a wood stand</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:48.100" style="s2">With a glass case on top of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.100" end="00:36:52.120" style="s2">It was inside the glass case and it was floating and it was sort of pulsing a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.120" end="00:36:55.480" style="s2">And so inside the room there was Stephen Hawking</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.860" end="00:36:59.960" style="s2">And the American President</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.060" end="00:37:02.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember who it was he was sort of faceless</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:05.180" style="s2">But Stephen I thought, Stephen Hawking? What the hell</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.180" end="00:37:06.660" style="s2">Disembodied intellect</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">That&#39;s Stephen Hawking so that&#39;s what that meant</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.840" end="00:37:13.580" style="s2">And the President well he&#39;s just the symbol of order</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.580" end="00:37:17.800" style="s2">And so this thing whatever it was that was surrounded by these winds</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.900" end="00:37:19.880" style="s2">Had been placed into a category system right?</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.880" end="00:37:24.580" style="s2">It was in a museum, it was boxed in. It had been conceptualized and categorized</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.580" end="00:37:29.260" style="s2">Partly by disembodied intellect, that was Stephen Hawking,  and partly by social order</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.260" end="00:37:32.180" style="s2">And so there&#39;s a Binswanger Boss thing going on there</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">The thing pulses and is alive so its got its own power</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:39.780" style="s2">But it&#39;s also encapsulated in a category system</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.780" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">So I&#39;m a third person observer in there I&#39;m not in the room I&#39;m just seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">So that was fine</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:45.860" style="s2">So the next thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">Oh yes, one of them described the features of the room</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:50.760" style="s2">Its walls were seven feet thick</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.760" end="00:37:52.660" style="s2">They didn&#39;t want this thing going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.660" end="00:37:55.140" style="s2">And it was made out of titanium dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.140" end="00:37:56.520" style="s2">I thought, what the hell is that?</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.520" end="00:37:57.880" style="s2">Well it&#39;s a paint</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.880" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">It&#39;s a paint substance but it&#39;s also what the hull of the Starship Enterprise is made out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.260" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">So my dream was saying well what&#39;s the hardest substance there is? Well it&#39;s titanium dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.900" end="00:38:09.620" style="s2">It&#39;s not getting out of that box</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.220" end="00:38:12.920" style="s2">The walls were designed to permanently constrain the object</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.920" end="00:38:15.775" style="s2">Okay now the next thing that happened was this object was</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.780" end="00:38:17.580" style="s2">You could tell it was kind of alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:21.900" style="s2">And it kept shifting around and at one point it turned into a chrysalis you know a cocoon</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.280" end="00:38:24.940" style="s2">And I thought what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.940" end="00:38:27.840" style="s2">And then, so it turned into a cocoon</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.840" end="00:38:30.460" style="s2">And I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen a chrysalis when it&#39;s just about to hatch</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.460" end="00:38:34.040" style="s2">But it twitches around eh? It&#39;s alive that thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.100" end="00:38:36.060" style="s2">So they&#39;re very strange things</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.080" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">And then at the end it turned itself into a pipe</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:40.200" style="s2">Like a Meerschaum pipe</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.200" end="00:38:41.460" style="s2">And I thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.040" end="00:38:43.840" style="s2">Then it reformed itself into a sphere</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.840" end="00:38:45.100" style="s2">And just shot right out of the room</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.100" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">Like the walls weren&#39;t even there</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.700" end="00:38:50.140" style="s2">It decided it was gone bang! It was gone</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.340" end="00:38:52.820" style="s2">And I woke up and I thought what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.820" end="00:38:54.260" style="s2">What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.340" end="00:38:56.380" style="s2">It took me forever to figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:38:59.860" style="s2">So then about two years after experiencing this dream,</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:02.040" style="s2">I was reading Dante&#39;s Inferno</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.140" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">In the ninth Canto, a messenger from God appears</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.240" end="00:39:07.260" style="s2">So Dante goes down into hell right?</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.260" end="00:39:10.020" style="s2">It was Dante&#39;s attempt to describe</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.380" end="00:39:12.060" style="s2">It&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.120" end="00:39:15.500" style="s2">So imagine that you go to a bad place psychologically right?</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.540" end="00:39:18.540" style="s2">So your life has collapsed that&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.540" end="00:39:22.580" style="s2">But then you&#39;re trying to figure out what you did wrong and how you&#39;re to blame for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.600" end="00:39:24.860" style="s2">And so what you do is a descent</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:28.300" style="s2">A descent into your own foolishness and stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.340" end="00:39:29.860" style="s2">Level, by level, by level</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.860" end="00:39:31.700" style="s2">And that&#39;s what Dante was trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.700" end="00:39:33.360" style="s2">That&#39;s what that hell was</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.360" end="00:39:37.140" style="s2">Levels of catastrophe and there&#39;s something right at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.320" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">And he found that it was betrayal that was at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.680" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">So in any case I was reading that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:45.960" style="s2">And there&#39;s a line in there that made me remember this dream</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.960" end="00:39:48.080" style="s2">Cause I tried to figure out this dream for years eh</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.320" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:39:52.325" end="00:39:55.135" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:39:55.135" end="00:39:58.245" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:39:59.185" end="00:40:02.335" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:02.335" end="00:40:05.345" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:05.345" end="00:40:08.035" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:08.035" end="00:40:11.005" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:11.005" end="00:40:13.655" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:13.655" end="00:40:16.545" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:16.545" end="00:40:19.315" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:19.315" end="00:40:22.315" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:22.320" end="00:40:25.140" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">So that was like a herald of the arrival of this messenger</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:31.480" style="s2">It&#39;s a very powerful scene</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.480" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">And I thought about this dream with this thing with the four storms</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.780" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:40.940" style="s2">The pipe thing that really, that really took me forever to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.100" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">And I finally remembered this painting by Magritte</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.960" end="00:40:45.020" style="s2">This is not a pipe</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:47.700" style="s2">Right so what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.560" end="00:40:54.900" style="s2">Well what it means is the representation is not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.180" end="00:40:57.220" style="s2">It&#39;s a very famous painting right?</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.305" end="00:40:59.655" style="s2">The representation is not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.115" end="00:41:03.065" style="s2">Well even the perception is not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.065" end="00:41:04.900" style="s2">And that&#39;s what the dream was trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.920" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">It&#39;s like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:10.200" style="s2">This thing that was so powerful and so capable of transforming</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.200" end="00:41:13.220" style="s2">Could be encapsulated temporarily within a conceptual system</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.220" end="00:41:16.100" style="s2">But whenever it decided to leave it was just going to leave</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.420" end="00:41:17.420" style="s2">And so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.700" end="00:41:21.740" style="s2">What is was referring to was the potential that there is inside objects</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.820" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">So for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.980" end="00:41:25.740" style="s2">And it&#39;s such a complicated thing to explain</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.800" end="00:41:28.280" style="s2">Nobody knew what cell phones were going to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.900" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">You make the cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:31.720" style="s2">You think you know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.720" end="00:41:33.320" style="s2">You don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.320" end="00:41:35.880" style="s2">No one knew what the birth control pill was going to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.320" end="00:41:39.300" style="s2">You make it, you think you know what it is, you have no idea what it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.500" end="00:41:41.720" style="s2">And it&#39;s going to do some of the things you think it will do</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.740" end="00:41:44.900" style="s2">And it&#39;s going to do a bunch of things you have no idea about</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.000" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">And that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">Things are more complex than they look</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.760" end="00:41:50.620" style="s2">They&#39;re multi-dimensional and they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.620" end="00:41:54.440" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say a life exactly but they have an intrinsic complexity</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.500" end="00:41:56.760" style="s2">That tends to unfold across time</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.760" end="00:41:58.260" style="s2">And it&#39;s only somewhat predictable</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.280" end="00:42:03.320" style="s2">And so you have things under your control and in your grasp to some limited degree</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.320" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">But at any point it&#39;s like the switch in the yin yang symbol</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.740" end="00:42:09.180" style="s2">At any time chaos can collapse into order</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.260" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">Or order can collapse into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:12.820" style="s2">And that&#39;s what that dream meant</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.840" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">Another painting by Magritte trying to express the same thing right?</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:22.020" style="s2">All men in suits, all uniform, all thinking the same way</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.020" end="00:42:24.220" style="s2">Same haircuts, completely socialized</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.220" end="00:42:27.160" style="s2">Blinded by their own perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.780" end="00:42:28.920" style="s2">That&#39;s us</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:32.540" style="s2">Cause you think well your perceptions illuminate and bring you information</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.540" end="00:42:34.360" style="s2">It&#39;s yes and no</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.360" end="00:42:36.700" style="s2">They also constrain to equal degree</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.380" end="00:42:40.600" style="s2">I dreamed much later about a year later</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.600" end="00:42:42.460" style="s2">This was a very cool image too</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.460" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">You know that image I think is it  Da Vinci or Michelangelo</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">Of the man inscribed in the square inside the circle</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:50.020" style="s2">It&#39;s a very famous image</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">Well it was like that except</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.200" end="00:42:54.260" style="s2">It was a cube and not a square</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.520" end="00:42:59.400" style="s2">And so there was kind of a faceless person, almost like a mannequin inside this cube</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.980" end="00:43:02.600" style="s2">And he was suspended about two feet off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.600" end="00:43:04.300" style="s2">And on the front wall</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.100" end="00:43:08.780" style="s2">It was like wall paper designs, there were these little squares about this big</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.780" end="00:43:12.020" style="s2">And they mandalas square with circles inside them</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.020" end="00:43:15.800" style="s2">And then inside the circle there was a little snake tail that was out</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.800" end="00:43:18.440" style="s2">And the whole wall was covered with these snake tails</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.760" end="00:43:19.660" style="s2">And the person</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.120" end="00:43:22.460" style="s2">When the person walked forward the wall would move forward</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.460" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">And when he walked backwards the wall would move backwards</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.800" end="00:43:27.020" style="s2">So it was always this far away</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.100" end="00:43:30.760" style="s2">And he could reach out and pull any of those snakes into being</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.100" end="00:43:33.860" style="s2">And so that was another dream of the same sort of idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.860" end="00:43:35.460" style="s2">What do you have in front of you?</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.460" end="00:43:36.660" style="s2">A world of objects</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.660" end="00:43:37.360" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.380" end="00:43:41.140" style="s2">You have a world of potential in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.340" end="00:43:44.420" style="s2">And you can interact with any aspect of that potential</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:46.380" style="s2">And while you&#39;re doing so, you realize it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.380" end="00:43:49.580" style="s2">You pull something into being that wouldn&#39;t have been there before</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">And what you see in front of you is a wall of potential</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:43:56.380" style="s2">The potential is not infinite because you&#39;re constrained</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:43:57.960" style="s2">But, it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.100" end="00:44:02.920" style="s2">For all intents and purposes it will do you just fine it&#39;s more potential than you could ever need</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.920" end="00:44:04.200" style="s2">And so the dream</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.260" end="00:44:05.340" style="s2">See dreams</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.980" end="00:44:11.620" style="s2">Dreams are at the forefront of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.860" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">They get there before you</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.720" end="00:44:16.580" style="s2">The creative imagination is at the forefront of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.580" end="00:44:19.715" style="s2">If you think that you&#39;re moving out into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.720" end="00:44:21.340" style="s2">To gather new information</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.360" end="00:44:23.800" style="s2">What gets there first is the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.820" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">Obviously that&#39;s what Piaget says about children as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">You imagine it first</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.440" end="00:44:30.780" style="s2">Then maybe you can represent it in speech</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.780" end="00:44:33.620" style="s2">And a dream is part of that imaginative process</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.620" end="00:44:35.020" style="s2">That&#39;s what artists are doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.120" end="00:44:37.740" style="s2">They&#39;re going out into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.800" end="00:44:39.820" style="s2">And representing it imaginatively</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.820" end="00:44:41.220" style="s2">So what does that painting mean?</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.220" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">Well if the artist knew that he&#39;d just write it down</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.500" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">Right? The art is beyond what&#39;s articulable otherwise it&#39;s not art it&#39;s just propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.100" end="00:44:55.720" style="s2">So the artist and the dream their out on the frontier right? That&#39;s the open imagination</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:58.260" style="s2">And so when you&#39;re conceptualizing new things</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.300" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">The dream and the imagination can bring you places that you don&#39;t even know that you can go</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.120" end="00:45:04.340" style="s2">And it&#39;s a mystery too</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.380" end="00:45:06.200" style="s2">It&#39;s like I don&#39;t know how I figured this out</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.200" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">It was as if the figuring out manifested itself inside me</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:12.080" style="s2">Cause that&#39;s the experience in a dream right?</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.100" end="00:45:14.780" style="s2">You don&#39;t feel &quot;I dreamed this up&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.780" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">You feel &quot;I had a dream.&quot; Where did that come from?</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:22.840" style="s2">It springs out of the unknown and offers something to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:35.600" style="s2">Here&#39;s pathology as conceptualized by the phenomenologists</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.180" end="00:45:38.535" style="s2">It&#39;s a very interesting way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.535" end="00:45:41.675" style="s2">Existential guilt and fear as debt to possibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:43.500" style="s2">Well so there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.500" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">It&#39;s like an exisitential idea that you have some problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">That you have some problems in your life</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">Well part of the Dasein is the sense of responsibility that you have to address those problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.940" end="00:45:58.700" style="s2">It&#39;s part and parcel of the way that human beings manifest themselves in the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.700" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">So part of your pathology would be failure to bear the responsibility for your being</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:06.140" style="s2">And a sense that you have a debt to your existence</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.340" end="00:46:10.120" style="s2">And according to the phenomenologists that&#39;s built right into the sense of your being</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.760" end="00:46:17.240" style="s2">It&#39;s a remarkable conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.095" end="00:46:24.255" style="s2">Right well that&#39;s a good place to stop</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.255" end="00:46:27.205" style="s2">Okay good we&#39;ll see you in a week and a half</p>
