<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">logs around that&#39;s the basic SEAL</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">training and I ran the the advanced kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">of tactical training where seals learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">to shoot move and communicate and where</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:27.390" style="s2">they learned their tactics and where</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">they learn combat leadership and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:32.489" style="s2">where I&#39;ve spent my last three years and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">then once I got done with that I retired</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.489" end="00:02:38.190" style="s2">from the Navy and when I got out I</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">started working with companies teaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">leadership and that expanded eventually</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:46.190" style="s2">started working with a friend of mine I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">was and the SEAL Teams with lave babban</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.190" end="00:02:52.769" style="s2">we got a lot of business consulting</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">about leadership eventually a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.769" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">those businesses asked us to write down</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:02:59.940" style="s2">the concepts that we had or you have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">be able to give them something you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.940" end="00:03:04.380" style="s2">hand out of some kind so we wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">the concepts and that eventually became</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.380" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">the book extreme ownership the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">extreme ownership came out in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">and in 2015 I was on Tim Ferriss his</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">podcast through a mutual friend through</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">to mutual foreheads Kirk parsley and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:24.329" style="s2">Peter attea and was on Tim Ferriss</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">podcast when when I got done recording</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.329" end="00:03:27.359" style="s2">with Tim Ferriss he press stop on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">record and he looked at me and said you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.359" end="00:03:33.780" style="s2">should do your own podcast and I noted</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:35.880" style="s2">that and then a couple weeks later or a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.780" end="00:03:37.829" style="s2">couple months later I was on Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.880" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">podcast and in the middle of podcast he</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.829" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">told me that I should have my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:44.280" style="s2">podcast so I started my own podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">because when Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.280" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">tell you to start a podcast you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">start a podcast so they told me I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:52.350" style="s2">started a podcast I&#39;ve recorded a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">hundred and eighty something podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.350" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">since then I&#39;ve written a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:03:58.380" style="s2">books a book called discipline equals</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">freedom Field Manual a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.380" end="00:04:01.829" style="s2">dichotomy leadership I&#39;ve written three</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">kids books in a series called the way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.829" end="00:04:06.299" style="s2">the warrior kids series and I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:09.569" style="s2">one book for smaller kids called Mikey</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.299" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">and the Dragons and we&#39;ve continued on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.569" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">with the business at national on front</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">working with companies all over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:18.570" style="s2">world teaching leadership I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">where I&#39;m at right now well it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.570" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">story something would be meaningful for</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:28.380" style="s2">me to know more about is</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:31.260" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve always understood that our</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.380" end="00:04:34.020" style="s2">military has had to have really a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.260" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">separate culture I&#39;m right down to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.020" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">say marriage ceremonies looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:42.360" style="s2">different in the military than they do</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:46.230" style="s2">outside and one of my questions is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.360" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">what extent is the military still a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.230" end="00:04:50.760" style="s2">separate culture do I have that wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:53.340" style="s2">and then following up on that to what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.760" end="00:04:58.100" style="s2">extent are the individual special forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.340" end="00:05:00.660" style="s2">units really an entirely alternate world</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.100" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">with different practices different</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.660" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">disciplinary regimes things that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:10.530" style="s2">unthinkable let&#39;s say in the civilian</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:13.320" style="s2">world the military is made up of a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.530" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">of human beings people from America from</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.320" end="00:05:18.870" style="s2">every different walk of life in America</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">and they all come in then certainly you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.870" end="00:05:23.040" style="s2">go through boot camp or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:24.419" style="s2">indoctrination program that you go</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.040" end="00:05:28.020" style="s2">through and you learn some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.419" end="00:05:32.039" style="s2">fundamental military methodologies of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.020" end="00:05:35.220" style="s2">living such as being disciplined such as</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.039" end="00:05:37.740" style="s2">chain of command such as the rank</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.220" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">structure tactics so you learn those</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.740" end="00:05:41.460" style="s2">things but at the end of the day those</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:43.890" style="s2">are just overlays on a bunch of human</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.460" end="00:05:47.190" style="s2">beings that are just human beings and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.890" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">that the military is just a subsection</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.190" end="00:05:52.979" style="s2">of American society and it reflects that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:55.560" style="s2">way inside the military as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.979" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">Special Operations Forces sure they all</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.560" end="00:05:58.919" style="s2">have their own little culture but you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.389" end="00:06:01.350" style="s2">know you go to different colleges and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.919" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">they have different cultures and you go</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.350" end="00:06:04.050" style="s2">to different businesses I work with</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:05.370" style="s2">different businesses all the time they</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.050" end="00:06:07.169" style="s2">all have their own little cultures going</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.370" end="00:06:10.020" style="s2">on inside and you don&#39;t think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.169" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">profound the military of a difference um</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.020" end="00:06:17.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s more profound</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:21.750" style="s2">there&#39;s some really dynamic companies</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.490" end="00:06:25.080" style="s2">out there that have very very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.750" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">rooted cultures and those are probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.080" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">in some cases even more distinct then</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.070" style="s2">what what you have inside the military</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">one thing that&#39;s interesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.070" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">military sure there&#39;s some military</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">traditions that go back hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:37.980" style="s2">years but the military people come and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:39.930" style="s2">go in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.980" end="00:06:41.250" style="s2">military all the time you know as an as</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.930" end="00:06:44.370" style="s2">an officer in the military you might</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.250" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">spend two maybe three years at a at an</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.370" end="00:06:48.600" style="s2">individual unit and then you&#39;re gone and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.650" end="00:06:50.220" style="s2">someone&#39;s gonna take your place so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.600" end="00:06:51.570" style="s2">not like a business or a company where</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.220" end="00:06:52.770" style="s2">sometimes you go to a company I work</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.570" end="00:06:55.740" style="s2">with companies where there&#39;s been people</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:06:56.900" style="s2">there for 28 years you know throughout</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.740" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">the chain of command maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.900" end="00:07:01.320" style="s2">frontline worker that&#39;s been running</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:03.900" style="s2">some machine at a company for 27 years</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.320" end="00:07:05.310" style="s2">or maybe it&#39;s the CEO who&#39;s owned the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.900" end="00:07:07.530" style="s2">business or started the business or</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.310" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">inherited the business or bought the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.530" end="00:07:12.840" style="s2">business but he&#39;s been there for a long</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2">time so those cultures can have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.840" end="00:07:17.880" style="s2">a more unified way about them because</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:20.550" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.880" end="00:07:22.620" style="s2">continuity of human beings in it whereas</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.550" end="00:07:24.350" style="s2">the military people move around and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.620" end="00:07:27.540" style="s2">get stationed they get out they retire</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.350" end="00:07:28.920" style="s2">but so there&#39;s there&#39;s cultures I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.540" end="00:07:31.920" style="s2">in in everywhere in the military</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.920" end="00:07:35.310" style="s2">certainly has a culture button depending</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.920" end="00:07:36.570" style="s2">on depending on what you&#39;re into you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.310" end="00:07:40.230" style="s2">know if you go to a Grateful Dead show</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.570" end="00:07:42.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll see a strong culture there that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.230" end="00:07:44.220" style="s2">everyone dresses the same everyone looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.360" end="00:07:47.400" style="s2">the same everyone probably thinks very</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.220" end="00:07:49.650" style="s2">similarly if you go to a Metallica show</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.400" end="00:07:53.130" style="s2">same thing you know people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.650" end="00:07:54.510" style="s2">dress very similarly so I guess it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.130" end="00:07:56.010" style="s2">I think everyone&#39;s got a culture and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.510" end="00:07:57.410" style="s2">it&#39;s present in the military for sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.010" end="00:08:01.140" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s cultures everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.410" end="00:08:04.260" style="s2">if somebody was in the military once</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.140" end="00:08:05.720" style="s2">said to me that you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.260" end="00:08:09.540" style="s2">that the military values</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.720" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">interoperability in place of continuity</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.540" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">that because people are constantly being</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:19.560" style="s2">moved around the culture is almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:23.550" style="s2">defined by a kind of mental flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.560" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">of a certain kind and that the person</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.550" end="00:08:28.740" style="s2">went on to say that American companies</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">used to move people around and have</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.740" end="00:08:33.479" style="s2">stopped doing that largely so that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:36.090" style="s2">used to be in his estimation that our</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.479" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">companies like Procter &amp; Gamble or an</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.090" end="00:08:40.860" style="s2">Exxon would be much more like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:42.780" style="s2">military and that they would have an</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">expectation that you would be posted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.780" end="00:08:46.670" style="s2">a particular place for a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:51.640" style="s2">there would be sort of a Welcome Wagon</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.670" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">there was a way of absorbing families</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.640" end="00:08:57.460" style="s2">and that that had actually been given up</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:59.650" style="s2">and that the military had retained some</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.460" end="00:09:01.420" style="s2">of that but that that was in fact also</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.650" end="00:09:03.610" style="s2">at risk I don&#39;t know whether that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.420" end="00:09:06.190" style="s2">resonates at all well certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:08.260" style="s2">military you you have to be adaptable</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.190" end="00:09:09.610" style="s2">right and when you take different people</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.260" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">all the time and you cycle them into</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.610" end="00:09:13.300" style="s2">different military units you learn to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:15.520" style="s2">work with different people that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.300" end="00:09:17.980" style="s2">sure and you can&#39;t get used to working</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.520" end="00:09:19.390" style="s2">with one type of human being because</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:20.980" style="s2">even though that human being has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.390" end="00:09:23.350" style="s2">through boot camp and been indoctrinated</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.980" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">they&#39;re still got all their own personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.350" end="00:09:27.580" style="s2">emotions and drives and personality and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:28.960" style="s2">idiosyncrasies and things that are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.580" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">drive you crazy and things that work</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.960" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">well and things that don&#39;t work well and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:33.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to deal with all those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:34.930" style="s2">all right and so it is that that does</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.520" end="00:09:36.490" style="s2">happen in the military and it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.930" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">the civilian sector now what I find</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.490" end="00:09:41.470" style="s2">interesting about that statement is I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:44.170" style="s2">think nowadays people change jobs a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.470" end="00:09:46.120" style="s2">more than they did when I was a kid when</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.170" end="00:09:47.890" style="s2">I was a kid all my friends parents they</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.120" end="00:09:49.450" style="s2">worked at the same company for 29 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.890" end="00:09:51.310" style="s2">so they might have been moved around by</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.450" end="00:09:53.650" style="s2">it and now you might move around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.310" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">but stay in the same city yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.650" end="00:09:59.740" style="s2">but you might move around from company</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:02.980" style="s2">to company right exactly so you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.740" end="00:10:03.940" style="s2">following on that one thing that I had</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.980" end="00:10:07.060" style="s2">heard that I thought was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.940" end="00:10:10.210" style="s2">interesting at at an almost a biological</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.060" end="00:10:14.100" style="s2">level was a description of boot camp</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.210" end="00:10:17.530" style="s2">which was that boot camp was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.100" end="00:10:20.080" style="s2">recapitulation of human development for</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.530" end="00:10:21.490" style="s2">adults that needed to be retrained as if</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.080" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">they had always been meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.490" end="00:10:27.730" style="s2">soldiers so that the idea being that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:30.250" style="s2">have a civilian set of instructions in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.730" end="00:10:33.640" style="s2">your brain and you have to more or less</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.250" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">blow it away to accept all of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.640" end="00:10:38.020" style="s2">differences that there really is a chain</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:39.400" style="s2">of command and it&#39;s not flexible in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.020" end="00:10:42.580" style="s2">way that your regular life might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.400" end="00:10:45.250" style="s2">flexible or that you think that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.580" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">can&#39;t do something that is within your</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.250" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">physical capacity to do it but requires</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:53.470" style="s2">a lot of effort for you to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">level and that in essence what boot camp</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.470" end="00:11:00.010" style="s2">was was it was a second childhood that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:03.070" style="s2">was imposed to make you safe to be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.010" end="00:11:04.990" style="s2">soldier to be in harm&#39;s way whereas if</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.070" end="00:11:07.060" style="s2">you took your regular self</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.990" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">to a battlefield your instincts would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.060" end="00:11:11.170" style="s2">completely counter to what would be safe</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:13.330" style="s2">for not only you but for others who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.170" end="00:11:15.790" style="s2">attached to you do you do you buy that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.330" end="00:11:18.310" style="s2">boot camp is effectively another version</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.790" end="00:11:19.810" style="s2">of childhood that is overlaid over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.310" end="00:11:21.880" style="s2">previous one I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.810" end="00:11:24.550" style="s2">another version of childhood but I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.880" end="00:11:28.120" style="s2">tell you what the military boot camps do</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.550" end="00:11:29.830" style="s2">an incredible job of taking normal human</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.120" end="00:11:32.470" style="s2">beings from every walk of life and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.830" end="00:11:34.149" style="s2">turning them into someone that is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.470" end="00:11:35.350" style="s2">many cases now the military is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.149" end="00:11:37.990" style="s2">perfect by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.350" end="00:11:41.410" style="s2">imagination but if you take a kid like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.990" end="00:11:43.290" style="s2">me well use me and as an example you</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.410" end="00:11:46.660" style="s2">take a kid like me that was a marginal</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.290" end="00:11:48.370" style="s2">student a marginal athlete I was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.660" end="00:11:51.399" style="s2">rebellious I was getting in trouble a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.370" end="00:11:53.230" style="s2">lot and you put me into boot camp and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.399" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">say okay here&#39;s you have a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.230" end="00:11:56.589" style="s2">none of your past matter so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:58.270" style="s2">care where you&#39;re from we don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.589" end="00:11:59.950" style="s2">what your parents did we don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.270" end="00:12:01.000" style="s2">about any of that we don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.950" end="00:12:03.070" style="s2">your history</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.000" end="00:12:04.870" style="s2">your past at all what we care about what</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.070" end="00:12:07.060" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do now and if you do these</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.870" end="00:12:09.459" style="s2">things you&#39;re gonna move in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.060" end="00:12:10.570" style="s2">direction you want to move into and here</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.459" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">here&#39;s what you&#39;re gonna do you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.570" end="00:12:14.200" style="s2">what you do in boot camp you fold your</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:16.510" style="s2">underwear a certain way you walk a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.200" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">certain way you eat a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.510" end="00:12:21.190" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do and if you do what</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:22.810" style="s2">they tell you to do you can move forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.190" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">and you can advance and things work out</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">well now what what the the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.180" end="00:12:29.260" style="s2">you got to remember is boot camp is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.940" style="s2">miniscule fraction of what your career</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.260" end="00:12:34.089" style="s2">in the military is all right so for</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.940" end="00:12:36.279" style="s2">instance obedience to orders right</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.089" end="00:12:37.810" style="s2">that&#39;s something that you get drilled to</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.279" end="00:12:39.459" style="s2">do in boot camp in fact the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.810" end="00:12:41.110" style="s2">military drill you you know you see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.459" end="00:12:42.279" style="s2">guys marching around with rifles on</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.110" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">their arms and they&#39;re all coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.279" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">doing synchronized movements that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:49.420" style="s2">called close order drill and they used</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:51.940" style="s2">to do it because when you were in battle</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.420" end="00:12:53.470" style="s2">in ranks in in the Revolutionary War</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.940" end="00:12:55.540" style="s2">period of course we didn&#39;t fight this</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.470" end="00:12:58.029" style="s2">way in America that&#39;s right we won but</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.540" end="00:12:59.709" style="s2">the the British military close order</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.029" end="00:13:00.730" style="s2">drill hey you&#39;re gonna draw your weapon</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.709" end="00:13:01.540" style="s2">at the same time you&#39;re gonna load your</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.730" end="00:13:03.310" style="s2">weapon at the same time you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.540" end="00:13:04.690" style="s2">fire your weapon at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.310" end="00:13:06.010" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna follow these orders when</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.690" end="00:13:08.770" style="s2">they come out directly that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.010" end="00:13:10.510" style="s2">was originally for right but they we</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.770" end="00:13:13.720" style="s2">still do close order drill in boot camp</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.510" end="00:13:15.880" style="s2">and the reason that they do it is so</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.720" end="00:13:18.010" style="s2">that you learn immediate obedience</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.880" end="00:13:20.140" style="s2">obedience to orders the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:22.270" style="s2">why you do it now what&#39;d you find out</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.140" end="00:13:24.610" style="s2">after boot camp and what I tell people</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.270" end="00:13:26.140" style="s2">all the time is the last thing I want as</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.610" end="00:13:27.670" style="s2">a commander is people that are just</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.140" end="00:13:29.320" style="s2">gonna obey my orders without questioning</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.670" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">them I want to be surrounded with people</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.320" end="00:13:33.280" style="s2">that question what I&#39;m saying that give</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.720" end="00:13:34.510" style="s2">me pushback when something doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.280" end="00:13:36.610" style="s2">sense and the last thing I want is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.510" end="00:13:40.930" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s gonna blindly obey my</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.610" end="00:13:43.390" style="s2">orders so boot camp is like childhood I</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.930" end="00:13:45.610" style="s2">guess but it&#39;s really only like infancy</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.390" end="00:13:47.530" style="s2">it really just teaches you get you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.610" end="00:13:49.180" style="s2">potty-trained and then once you get into</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.530" end="00:13:52.270" style="s2">the military that&#39;s where you actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.180" end="00:13:54.250" style="s2">learn to maneuver how to lead how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.270" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">interact with other people you learn how</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.250" end="00:13:58.060" style="s2">to flex up and down the chain of command</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:00.220" style="s2">like you talked about the inflexibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.060" end="00:14:01.720" style="s2">of the chain of command that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.220" end="00:14:03.730" style="s2">once you get the further you get in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.720" end="00:14:05.650" style="s2">military the more flexibility you see in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.730" end="00:14:08.140" style="s2">the chain of command so in part wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.650" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">that be because the people who rise to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.140" end="00:14:13.060" style="s2">positions of power cannot get there by</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">doing it highly egoic lee that they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.060" end="00:14:18.250" style="s2">to actually recognize that the guy at</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:21.310" style="s2">the bottom might have the best</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.250" end="00:14:24.580" style="s2">information in this so that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.310" end="00:14:27.910" style="s2">because we refuse to promote people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.580" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">are crazily egoic that we have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.910" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">of flexibility well that is an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:33.280" style="s2">outlook and and certainly that would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.650" style="s2">a nice thing but no there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.280" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">peope the you know like I said in an</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.650" end="00:14:38.410" style="s2">ideal situation sure people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:39.790" style="s2">promoted because they&#39;re the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.410" end="00:14:41.830" style="s2">are open-minded there&#39;s the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.790" end="00:14:42.940" style="s2">put their ego aside but I have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.830" end="00:14:44.620" style="s2">explain this to people all the time that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.940" end="00:14:47.410" style="s2">because I always tell people hey you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.620" end="00:14:48.970" style="s2">need to keep your ego in check and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.410" end="00:14:51.070" style="s2">have to explain to people yeah sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.970" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">that person that is concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.070" end="00:14:54.970" style="s2">themselves and they&#39;re taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:56.620" style="s2">themselves well I&#39;m telling you Eric hey</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.970" end="00:14:57.730" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about you know don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.620" end="00:14:59.590" style="s2">about yourself take care of the team</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.730" end="00:15:00.250" style="s2">take care of the mission and and things</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.590" end="00:15:02.080" style="s2">will be okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.250" end="00:15:03.490" style="s2">and I have to say but listen you this</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.080" end="00:15:05.140" style="s2">other guy who&#39;s taking care of himself</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.490" end="00:15:06.640" style="s2">he might actually get a promotion ahead</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.140" end="00:15:08.260" style="s2">of you he might move ahead of you this</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.640" end="00:15:10.120" style="s2">time he might even move ahead of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.260" end="00:15:11.320" style="s2">next time but guess what eventually</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.120" end="00:15:13.630" style="s2">people are gonna look at that guy</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.320" end="00:15:14.890" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna characterize him for what</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.630" end="00:15:15.910" style="s2">he is which is someone that&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.890" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">care of himself doesn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.910" end="00:15:20.170" style="s2">anyone else and that is gonna undermine</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:22.960" style="s2">his future so in the long run Fran</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.170" end="00:15:24.040" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;ll advance because you took</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.960" end="00:15:25.450" style="s2">care of the team you take care of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.040" end="00:15:26.860" style="s2">mission maybe in the short term you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.450" end="00:15:28.390" style="s2">might advance because you took care of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.860" end="00:15:31.450" style="s2">yourself but that&#39;s not a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.390" end="00:15:31.760" style="s2">solution so ideally yes people that put</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.450" end="00:15:33.410" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.760" end="00:15:35.090" style="s2">and check of those are the people that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.410" end="00:15:36.350" style="s2">get promoted unfortunately it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.090" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">always work that way sometimes some</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.350" end="00:15:39.950" style="s2">people are egomaniacs and they they step</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:42.770" style="s2">on people&#39;s backs and they make it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.950" end="00:15:45.800" style="s2">the top that absolutely happens do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.770" end="00:15:49.790" style="s2">find that there&#39;s a I mean I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.800" end="00:15:52.820" style="s2">suspicious of the idea of really</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.790" end="00:15:57.740" style="s2">sidelining the ego and the ego is in</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.820" end="00:15:59.570" style="s2">some sense this receptacle before we you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.740" end="00:16:02.120" style="s2">know our life needs a protagonist</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.570" end="00:16:04.070" style="s2">somehow and the ego provides that sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.120" end="00:16:06.140" style="s2">that it is about us because we have one</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.070" end="00:16:10.970" style="s2">set of eyes and that&#39;s how we tour the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.140" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">world do you find that the people that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.970" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">you respect the most keeping their ego</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:18.500" style="s2">in check as you say it are people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:21.290" style="s2">are really not highly ago or are they</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.500" end="00:16:23.300" style="s2">people who have their ego involved in</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.290" end="00:16:25.270" style="s2">like a Mexican standoff with other parts</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.300" end="00:16:28.820" style="s2">of their personality so that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.270" end="00:16:30.110" style="s2">tension and a dynamism to you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.820" end="00:16:31.580" style="s2">there&#39;s something that I call the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.110" end="00:16:33.080" style="s2">dichotomy of leadership which are these</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.580" end="00:16:35.060" style="s2">opposing forces that are pulling you in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.080" end="00:16:37.310" style="s2">opposite directions all the time and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.060" end="00:16:40.070" style="s2">yes ego is absolutely one of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.310" end="00:16:42.440" style="s2">things because if I if I truly had no</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.070" end="00:16:44.060" style="s2">ego well then I wouldn&#39;t care what my</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.440" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">performance was I wouldn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.060" end="00:16:48.200" style="s2">anything right I would just be happy to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:51.710" style="s2">be sitting watching television and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.200" end="00:16:54.650" style="s2">eating Cheetos that&#39;s what a total lack</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.710" end="00:16:56.690" style="s2">of ego could do to me the other extreme</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.650" end="00:16:58.310" style="s2">is hey I&#39;m gonna step on everyone&#39;s back</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.690" end="00:17:00.110" style="s2">in order and rise to the top and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.310" end="00:17:02.150" style="s2">care whoever gets in my way I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.110" end="00:17:03.950" style="s2">take them down where do we want to be we</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.150" end="00:17:06.350" style="s2">want to be in a balanced place where</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.950" end="00:17:07.310" style="s2">we&#39;re confident but we&#39;re not cocky you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.350" end="00:17:10.699" style="s2">know I went and spoke with some</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.310" end="00:17:12.020" style="s2">inner-city kids here in LA anyone when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.699" end="00:17:13.459" style="s2">ever went out I speak to people one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.020" end="00:17:14.750" style="s2">the topics that I talk to them about is</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.459" end="00:17:16.100" style="s2">hey you&#39;ve got to stay humble because</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.750" end="00:17:18.829" style="s2">normally I&#39;m talking to people that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.100" end="00:17:20.270" style="s2">CEOs of companies or you know people</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.829" end="00:17:22.760" style="s2">that are in positions of power and so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.270" end="00:17:24.320" style="s2">have to constantly remind them to keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.760" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">their ego in check and that originally</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.320" end="00:17:28.850" style="s2">that originated in the fact that I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:31.070" style="s2">training young seal leaders and young</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.850" end="00:17:32.840" style="s2">seal leaders they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.070" end="00:17:34.520" style="s2">frontrunners they&#39;re overachievers</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.840" end="00:17:36.290" style="s2">they&#39;re they got a strong ego so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.520" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">have to be told hey you got to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.290" end="00:17:38.840" style="s2">thing in check you&#39;ve got to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:40.340" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to other people you got</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.840" end="00:17:41.210" style="s2">to hear other people&#39;s ideas you got to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.340" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">make sure that you&#39;re taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.210" end="00:17:43.700" style="s2">your team ahead of yourself they need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:46.340" style="s2">hear that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.700" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2">I went and spoke with these inner-city</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.340" end="00:17:48.830" style="s2">kids and it was an interesting group of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.900" end="00:17:50.810" style="s2">inner-city kids because they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.830" end="00:17:52.010" style="s2">just they weren&#39;t just underprivileged</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.810" end="00:17:53.960" style="s2">they were underprivileged but they had</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.010" end="00:17:55.430" style="s2">done some kind of tests so that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.960" end="00:17:58.610" style="s2">were there were there were smart kids</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.430" end="00:18:00.200" style="s2">and I was gonna talk about the normal</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.610" end="00:18:01.880" style="s2">topics that I speak on and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.200" end="00:18:03.830" style="s2">is humility and I went in this room and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.880" end="00:18:05.810" style="s2">I immediately realized I wasn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.830" end="00:18:09.530" style="s2">talk about humility at all because every</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.810" end="00:18:11.540" style="s2">one of these kids in this room was was</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.530" end="00:18:13.340" style="s2">beat down you that was eat the message</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.540" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">they need their their heads were hung</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.340" end="00:18:17.270" style="s2">low they wouldn&#39;t look me in the eyes so</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:19.400" style="s2">what they needed here is hey be</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.270" end="00:18:21.680" style="s2">confident you you have capability you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.400" end="00:18:24.290" style="s2">can do this so they were there&#39;s a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.680" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">of people whose ego was was crushed too</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.290" end="00:18:27.710" style="s2">far and they needed to have confidence</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:29.060" style="s2">built up so again this is another one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.710" end="00:18:30.530" style="s2">those classic dichotomies that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.060" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">be balanced you need yes you need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.530" end="00:18:34.610" style="s2">have an ego but at the same time you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:35.720" style="s2">have to be humble enough to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.610" end="00:18:39.770" style="s2">other people and you can&#39;t let your ego</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.720" end="00:18:41.240" style="s2">get out of control so I&#39;m super glad to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.770" end="00:18:44.090" style="s2">hear you bring up the dichotomy of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.240" end="00:18:46.070" style="s2">leadership and and I was just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.090" end="00:18:48.830" style="s2">touch it lightly can you talk more about</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.070" end="00:18:52.010" style="s2">what that theory is and how you&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.830" end="00:18:55.610" style="s2">to it it&#39;s interesting the way I came to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.010" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">it the way I came to it was by Rio</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.610" end="00:19:01.910" style="s2">actually had to have the ultimate form</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:04.910" style="s2">of humility or myself because I realized</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.910" end="00:19:07.310" style="s2">as I preached these many of the theories</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.910" end="00:19:09.020" style="s2">that I had as I preached them I realized</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.310" end="00:19:10.730" style="s2">that I wasn&#39;t always right and I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.020" end="00:19:13.130" style="s2">an example is yeah one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.730" end="00:19:14.780" style="s2">that I always talked about especially on</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.130" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">the battlefield was that you had to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.780" end="00:19:17.240" style="s2">aggressive like you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:19.940" style="s2">aggressive that&#39;s what you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.240" end="00:19:21.800" style="s2">you have to be ready to maneuver you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.940" end="00:19:23.210" style="s2">have to take the fight to the enemy if</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.800" end="00:19:24.710" style="s2">you see a problem you need to attack</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.210" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">that problem I talk about that all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.710" end="00:19:28.850" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:30.830" style="s2">and then plain as day clearly are there</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.850" end="00:19:33.230" style="s2">times when as a leader or as a human</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.830" end="00:19:36.230" style="s2">being you can be too aggressive yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.230" end="00:19:38.120" style="s2">there absolutely are and we used to call</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.230" end="00:19:40.340" style="s2">that running to your death hey if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.120" end="00:19:42.110" style="s2">super hyper aggressive because Jocko</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.340" end="00:19:44.150" style="s2">said you got to be aggressive and so now</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.110" end="00:19:46.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a machine-gun nest on a hill and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.150" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">you just go charge that thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.190" end="00:19:51.170" style="s2">gonna die and whoever follows you is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:54.830" style="s2">also going to die so you you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.170" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">you you have to you have to modulate</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.830" end="00:19:57.860" style="s2">your aggression either sometimes we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:00.049" style="s2">to back off</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.860" end="00:20:03.289" style="s2">and that was sort of the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.049" end="00:20:04.039" style="s2">that I said well on the one hand I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.289" end="00:20:05.149" style="s2">talked about you got to be aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.039" end="00:20:07.010" style="s2">but there&#39;s times where you can be too</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.149" end="00:20:10.340" style="s2">aggressive and then I said to myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.010" end="00:20:11.990" style="s2">well what about what about talking as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.340" end="00:20:13.309" style="s2">leader because because of the leader you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.990" end="00:20:14.779" style="s2">have to talk right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.309" end="00:20:17.149" style="s2">communicate with the other people on</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.779" end="00:20:19.789" style="s2">your team right is there such a thing as</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.149" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">a leader that can talk too much yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.789" end="00:20:24.500" style="s2">there absolutely is and if I as a leader</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:26.120" style="s2">all I do is talk talk talk talk talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:27.140" style="s2">we&#39;ll eventually people stop listening</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.120" end="00:20:29.630" style="s2">to me they don&#39;t know what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.140" end="00:20:32.179" style="s2">what&#39;s not I over communicate to them to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.630" end="00:20:34.909" style="s2">the point where they stop listening so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.179" end="00:20:36.169" style="s2">you can talk too much but the other side</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.909" end="00:20:38.029" style="s2">of the spectrum is I don&#39;t talk enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.169" end="00:20:39.110" style="s2">and now you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.029" end="00:20:42.620" style="s2">the team doesn&#39;t know which direction</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.110" end="00:20:45.590" style="s2">we&#39;re headed so this is where this idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.620" end="00:20:47.480" style="s2">came from is that the the the quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.590" end="00:20:49.850" style="s2">that we&#39;re looking for isn&#39;t on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.480" end="00:20:51.380" style="s2">extremes it&#39;s a balanced it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.850" end="00:20:54.350" style="s2">dichotomy of leadership and finding the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.380" end="00:20:55.720" style="s2">balance in those dichotomies let lead me</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.350" end="00:20:58.190" style="s2">and my buddy life to write this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.720" end="00:20:59.539" style="s2">follow-on book two extreme ownership the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.190" end="00:21:01.639" style="s2">reason to follow on book two extreme</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.539" end="00:21:04.370" style="s2">ownership the reason for that is because</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.639" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">that&#39;s as we work with companies not</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.370" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">only did most questions revolve around</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:12.710" style="s2">this idea of the dichotomy of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.190" end="00:21:17.389" style="s2">but most answers most answers that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.710" end="00:21:20.419" style="s2">give are someone says oh my team isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.389" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">taking any initiative ok well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.419" end="00:21:22.669" style="s2">break that problem down why is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.669" end="00:21:28.490" style="s2">that&#39;s happening because you perhaps are</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">taking so much ownership so much extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.490" end="00:21:31.159" style="s2">ownership you read the book extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:33.019" style="s2">ownership so you&#39;re taking so all this</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.159" end="00:21:34.669" style="s2">ownership well now your team doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.019" end="00:21:35.929" style="s2">have any ownership so they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.669" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">waiting for you to tell them what to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.929" end="00:21:40.909" style="s2">so when you do that their initiative</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:42.769" style="s2">gets crushed you go too far in the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.909" end="00:21:43.940" style="s2">direction and you&#39;ve got people doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.769" end="00:21:45.980" style="s2">things that they shouldn&#39;t be doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.940" end="00:21:48.139" style="s2">working on their their stepping outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.980" end="00:21:49.460" style="s2">their bounds they&#39;re they&#39;re not staying</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.139" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">within the parameters you&#39;ve given them</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.460" end="00:21:53.059" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got them running wild so</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:54.860" style="s2">you don&#39;t gone too far in the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.059" end="00:21:56.809" style="s2">direction where do you want to be you</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.860" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">want to be balanced and and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.809" end="00:22:05.090" style="s2">that dichotomy of leadership comes in so</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:07.700" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s fascinating to have to tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.090" end="00:22:09.919" style="s2">people that the best advice is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.700" end="00:22:11.660" style="s2">constantly recalibrate the forces that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.919" end="00:22:16.060" style="s2">are in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.660" end="00:22:19.550" style="s2">in your mind do you have any way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.060" end="00:22:21.650" style="s2">helping people in general with</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.550" end="00:22:23.180" style="s2">dialectics that need to cover their I</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.650" end="00:22:24.590" style="s2">feel like you know I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.180" end="00:22:28.040" style="s2">beautiful what you said before about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.590" end="00:22:30.710" style="s2">these inner-city inner-city kids so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.040" end="00:22:34.940" style="s2">of what I hear is people giving blanket</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.710" end="00:22:37.370" style="s2">advice which has no sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.940" end="00:22:40.550" style="s2">listener it&#39;s finding so you know like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.370" end="00:22:42.380" style="s2">you teach people to be humble who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.550" end="00:22:45.650" style="s2">already humble you&#39;re just cutting them</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.380" end="00:22:47.210" style="s2">off at the at the knees or if you teach</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.650" end="00:22:48.700" style="s2">people you know you need to be assertive</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.210" end="00:22:51.950" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.700" end="00:22:54.770" style="s2">wildly over-aggressive the person just</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.950" end="00:22:58.210" style="s2">takes it as license how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.770" end="00:23:01.130" style="s2">responsibly push out a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.210" end="00:23:05.390" style="s2">balance which isn&#39;t mealy-mouthed but</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.130" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">really has full-blown versions of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.390" end="00:23:12.020" style="s2">opposing ideas with within one mind that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:14.630" style="s2">again that&#39;s that&#39;s why this book that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.020" end="00:23:18.920" style="s2">economy leadership was we had to write</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.630" end="00:23:22.070" style="s2">it that&#39;s because because we put the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.920" end="00:23:24.440" style="s2">name on the first book extreme ownership</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.070" end="00:23:26.510" style="s2">we gave it that name and and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">great concept when you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.510" end="00:23:29.270" style="s2">that don&#39;t want to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.590" style="s2">for things like listen you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.270" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">take extreme ownership of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.590" end="00:23:35.480" style="s2">on but it&#39;s like you said when you give</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:37.670" style="s2">it that to someone that&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.480" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2">micromanager right oh they&#39;re all of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.670" end="00:23:40.100" style="s2">sudden they&#39;re running with it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:41.990" style="s2">would you say a license it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.100" end="00:23:44.090" style="s2">have a license now to micromanage</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.990" end="00:23:46.490" style="s2">double-o micromanage yeah and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.090" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">wondering why things are falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.490" end="00:23:49.700" style="s2">on them and why no one has any</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:51.170" style="s2">initiative anymore and why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">having to make every single decision and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.170" end="00:23:54.260" style="s2">why the frontline troops aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:55.730" style="s2">maneuvering on their own well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.260" end="00:23:58.190" style="s2">because you&#39;re micromanaging them now</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.730" end="00:24:00.410" style="s2">you&#39;re micromanaging them to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.190" end="00:24:03.680" style="s2">so that is why we had to do it because</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.410" end="00:24:06.980" style="s2">these these things as you said you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.680" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">to constantly modulate all these</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.980" end="00:24:10.460" style="s2">different balances all these different</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">dichotomies you have to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.460" end="00:24:15.890" style="s2">modulate them and by the way once you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:17.690" style="s2">get it modulated today right tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.890" end="00:24:19.100" style="s2">it&#39;ll change a little bit yeah cuz all</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.690" end="00:24:20.390" style="s2">of a sudden you know if you were if you</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.980" end="00:24:25.190" style="s2">I need you to step up more and you go oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.050" end="00:24:27.290" style="s2">okay cool and</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.290" end="00:24:30.110" style="s2">some project that I hadn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.460" end="00:24:31.940" style="s2">authorized and now I got to come back</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.110" end="00:24:33.560" style="s2">and I got a I got to adjust because now</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.940" end="00:24:35.420" style="s2">I gotta tighten you up and say hey I</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.560" end="00:24:37.250" style="s2">want you to take initiative and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.420" end="00:24:38.300" style="s2">appreciate it but you still got to stay</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.250" end="00:24:40.820" style="s2">within the bounds of what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.300" end="00:24:42.710" style="s2">to get done so I was right yesterday and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.820" end="00:24:44.300" style="s2">now all of a sudden same mindset I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.710" end="00:24:46.820" style="s2">wrong and I have to adjust again so</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.300" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">you&#39;re a hundred percent spot on there</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.820" end="00:24:51.560" style="s2">you have to modulate all these</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:53.060" style="s2">principles for the people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.560" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">dealing with and the situation that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.060" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">they&#39;re in so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:01.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve been really curious about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:03.110" style="s2">know whether this rate whether you react</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.640" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">to this in any way and in any way at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.110" end="00:25:07.880" style="s2">is we always talked about teaching</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:10.220" style="s2">critical thinking but we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.880" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">about teaching critical feeling and but</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.220" end="00:25:15.890" style="s2">what by critical feeling I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:19.610" style="s2">most of our emotions are susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.890" end="00:25:23.480" style="s2">becoming maladaptive and because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.610" end="00:25:26.090" style="s2">not in analytic thoughts they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.480" end="00:25:28.910" style="s2">harder to access and harder to influence</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.090" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">I would imagine that when you were in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.910" end="00:25:33.530" style="s2">some situation where you&#39;re you know in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:35.660" style="s2">harm&#39;s way and you&#39;ve got a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.530" end="00:25:38.060" style="s2">people that you&#39;re looking out for and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.660" end="00:25:39.220" style="s2">you got to get something done and stakes</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.060" end="00:25:41.960" style="s2">are very high</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.220" end="00:25:44.810" style="s2">the emotions that you might have around</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.960" end="00:25:47.000" style="s2">your house on the weekend when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.810" end="00:25:49.700" style="s2">with your family are very different than</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.000" end="00:25:52.700" style="s2">the emotions you can afford when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.700" end="00:25:56.180" style="s2">actually engaged in some sort of action</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.700" end="00:25:57.710" style="s2">in a military context can you do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.180" end="00:25:59.930" style="s2">relate to this concept of critical</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.710" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">feeling at all does that sound like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.930" end="00:26:04.460" style="s2">something that you have had to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:08.150" style="s2">about am i off base I have had to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.460" end="00:26:11.660" style="s2">about emotions a ton yeah and what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.150" end="00:26:14.900" style="s2">have found with emotions is just like</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.660" end="00:26:18.470" style="s2">every other thing that we have as human</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.900" end="00:26:21.380" style="s2">beings they can get out of balance so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.470" end="00:26:23.420" style="s2">I have a leader that gets super</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.380" end="00:26:25.280" style="s2">emotional about every decision or flies</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.420" end="00:26:27.920" style="s2">off the handle or shows a bunch of anger</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.280" end="00:26:30.050" style="s2">and loses his temper that is not going</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.920" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">to be good people will not respect that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.050" end="00:26:34.850" style="s2">people will not trust his judgment</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:37.280" style="s2">because they&#39;re emotional so we can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.850" end="00:26:38.150" style="s2">and and be super emotional human beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.280" end="00:26:38.990" style="s2">if we&#39;re trying to be in a leadership</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.150" end="00:26:40.790" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">and that includes in your house right if</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.790" end="00:26:44.030" style="s2">you fly off the handle with your wife or</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:45.860" style="s2">you fly off the handle with your kids</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.030" end="00:26:46.970" style="s2">that is not gonna be healthy for those</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.860" end="00:26:48.230" style="s2">kids they&#39;re not gonna trust your</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.970" end="00:26:49.700" style="s2">judgment they&#39;re not gonna respect you</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.230" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">how can they respect you when you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:54.020" style="s2">control your own temper and if they do</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">respect it that&#39;s actually scary because</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.020" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">what you&#39;re teaching them is that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:59.750" style="s2">order to get respect what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:27:01.070" style="s2">is have a violent crazy temper so you so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.750" end="00:27:03.290" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be a super hyper</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.070" end="00:27:04.700" style="s2">emotional person what&#39;s the other end of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.290" end="00:27:06.830" style="s2">the spectrum the other end of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.700" end="00:27:09.380" style="s2">spectrum is I&#39;ve shut my emotions off</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.830" end="00:27:11.809" style="s2">completely I don&#39;t I&#39;m totally and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.380" end="00:27:13.370" style="s2">completely detached I have no emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.809" end="00:27:15.320" style="s2">connection with the people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.370" end="00:27:17.510" style="s2">leading whether they&#39;re on my team or in</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.320" end="00:27:18.290" style="s2">my family and guess what if I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.510" end="00:27:21.530" style="s2">that connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.290" end="00:27:22.280" style="s2">as a human being as human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.530" end="00:27:25.880" style="s2">working for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.280" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">they are not going to do what they need</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.880" end="00:27:30.200" style="s2">to do to accomplish the mission when</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:33.230" style="s2">they see me as a cold-blooded robot</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.200" end="00:27:34.010" style="s2">so with these emotions you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.230" end="00:27:36.140" style="s2">them under control</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.010" end="00:27:37.400" style="s2">I&#39;m not telling people and I don&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.140" end="00:27:38.900" style="s2">people that they should be void of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.400" end="00:27:40.010" style="s2">emotion right because if your void of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.900" end="00:27:42.200" style="s2">emotions you&#39;re a robot and people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.010" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">follow robots people follow other human</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.200" end="00:27:46.580" style="s2">beings people follow human beings that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.650" style="s2">they&#39;re connected to emotionally however</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.580" end="00:27:49.790" style="s2">let that go too far and your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.650" end="00:27:51.590" style="s2">are out of control and you&#39;re making bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:53.720" style="s2">decisions you fire I always ask people</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.590" end="00:27:55.280" style="s2">when but what kind of decisions do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.720" end="00:27:57.350" style="s2">make when you were super emotional the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.280" end="00:27:59.929" style="s2">answer is not really like this once yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.350" end="00:28:01.160" style="s2">but if you completely cut emotions out</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.929" end="00:28:03.050" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve got a team and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.160" end="00:28:05.750" style="s2">gonna make a decision that&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.050" end="00:28:07.370" style="s2">massive negative impact on them and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.750" end="00:28:09.140" style="s2">don&#39;t let those emotions play a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.370" end="00:28:11.870" style="s2">bit and you just make the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.140" end="00:28:13.880" style="s2">business decision okay great you made a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.870" end="00:28:16.550" style="s2">perfect this business decision you saved</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.880" end="00:28:17.990" style="s2">X amount of dollars but but you cut that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.550" end="00:28:19.550" style="s2">emotional connection with your people</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.990" end="00:28:22.370" style="s2">and they saw that you didn&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.550" end="00:28:23.960" style="s2">about their emotions okay you got the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.370" end="00:28:25.429" style="s2">short-term win you made a little more</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.960" end="00:28:27.020" style="s2">money this quarter guess what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.429" end="00:28:28.520" style="s2">happening next quarter you losing three</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.020" end="00:28:30.350" style="s2">people critical people that went and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.520" end="00:28:31.820" style="s2">found a job somewhere else somebody some</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.350" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">other leader somewhere made an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">connection with them and now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:40.670" style="s2">gone and so your short-term win turns</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:42.800" style="s2">into a long-term loss how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.670" end="00:28:44.740" style="s2">you think about the concept we&#39;re used</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.800" end="00:28:47.510" style="s2">to hearing you&#39;re overthinking this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.740" end="00:28:50.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve started to try this phrase I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.510" end="00:28:52.700" style="s2">you&#39;re over feeling this I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.510" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">that in our public square it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.700" end="00:28:57.650" style="s2">become more important to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:29:00.650" style="s2">explore one&#39;s feelings and to the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.650" end="00:29:02.510" style="s2">where I find it absolutely distracting</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.650" end="00:29:05.690" style="s2">the the extent to which people are now</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.510" end="00:29:08.900" style="s2">sharing their feelings feels to my way</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.690" end="00:29:10.430" style="s2">of thinking wrong they&#39;re not holding</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.900" end="00:29:11.900" style="s2">anything back there&#39;s nothing intimate</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.430" end="00:29:15.710" style="s2">you&#39;re expected to go into this</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.900" end="00:29:18.260" style="s2">performative kind of heart connection to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.710" end="00:29:20.840" style="s2">you know various abstractions do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.260" end="00:29:22.610" style="s2">think they&#39;re I know there&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.840" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2">way of saying it like you&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.610" end="00:29:27.740" style="s2">feeling this is not an easy thing for</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.520" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">people to hear how do you get people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.740" end="00:29:31.400" style="s2">to rein in some of those emotion no I</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:32.870" style="s2">actually don&#39;t don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.400" end="00:29:34.520" style="s2">better way of saying that over feelings</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.870" end="00:29:36.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a great term I I think I might have</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.520" end="00:29:37.940" style="s2">to use that that&#39;s great and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.260" end="00:29:41.210" style="s2">explaining what I just explained right</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.940" end="00:29:43.280" style="s2">if I if you tell me something and my</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.210" end="00:29:46.460" style="s2">emotion is this or my reaction is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.280" end="00:29:48.110" style="s2">massive emotional reaction what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.460" end="00:29:50.270" style="s2">horrible about it from a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.110" end="00:29:52.580" style="s2">perspective is if you tell me some</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.270" end="00:29:54.200" style="s2">opinion and I just immediately fly off</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.580" end="00:29:56.120" style="s2">the handle emotionally right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.200" end="00:29:57.560" style="s2">listen to another word that I say and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.120" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">means nothing to you other than you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.560" end="00:30:01.490" style="s2">he&#39;s super emotional you just you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:03.380" style="s2">discount everything that I say because</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.490" end="00:30:05.480" style="s2">I&#39;m emotional and that you as a human</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.380" end="00:30:06.920" style="s2">being know that someone else being super</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.480" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">emotional isn&#39;t thinking straight and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.920" end="00:30:12.290" style="s2">isn&#39;t making good decisions and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:14.810" style="s2">they&#39;re just just being emotional so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.290" end="00:30:16.430" style="s2">better to say oh interesting point let</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.810" end="00:30:17.540" style="s2">me give you what what my take on that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.430" end="00:30:18.530" style="s2">and all of a sudden you&#39;re gonna sit</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.540" end="00:30:19.580" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna listen to me you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.530" end="00:30:21.920" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna hear me out</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:23.270" style="s2">and so yes over feeling is something</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.920" end="00:30:25.460" style="s2">that happens all the time and again</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.270" end="00:30:27.350" style="s2">that&#39;s just going too far out of balance</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.460" end="00:30:31.160" style="s2">in the dichotomy of leadership with your</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.350" end="00:30:35.750" style="s2">emotions so another thing I want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.160" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">explore with you is this question well</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.750" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">come at it from kind of a funny angle</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.270" style="s2">are you familiar with Esther Perel at</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">all the relationship expert</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.270" end="00:30:48.590" style="s2">no she specializes in thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:51.740" style="s2">very difficult topics she&#39;s touched you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.590" end="00:30:54.440" style="s2">know what happens to marriage in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.740" end="00:30:56.570" style="s2">monogamous setting when it feels very</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.440" end="00:30:59.260" style="s2">constraining she&#39;s touched on infidelity</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.570" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">she&#39;s not talking about workplace issues</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.260" end="00:31:03.770" style="s2">where she&#39;s exploring you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:05.210" style="s2">forbidden thoughts about what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.770" end="00:31:09.020" style="s2">the workplace</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.210" end="00:31:10.820" style="s2">and one of the things that she said to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.020" end="00:31:13.460" style="s2">me that was very interesting is it she</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.820" end="00:31:16.190" style="s2">was reconsidering masculinity and she</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:19.130" style="s2">said the masculinity is clearly an</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.190" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">incredibly powerful thing but did she</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.130" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">hadn&#39;t appreciated that it is as fragile</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:29.390" style="s2">as it is powerful that the number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">ways of invalidating men is quite high</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.390" end="00:31:36.549" style="s2">and that there is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:39.020" style="s2">dependence on kind of a bargain in which</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.549" end="00:31:40.789" style="s2">men tend to be more disposable</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.020" end="00:31:44.590" style="s2">particularly in times of war and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.789" end="00:31:49.159" style="s2">conflict let&#39;s be honest about it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.590" end="00:31:52.909" style="s2">that there is something both extremely</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.159" end="00:31:55.159" style="s2">powerful but also fragile about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.909" end="00:31:57.799" style="s2">concept of masculinity itself it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.159" end="00:32:00.169" style="s2">difficult for us even in our society to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.799" end="00:32:02.330" style="s2">find things that are wholly positive</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.169" end="00:32:04.279" style="s2">that we ascribe to the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.330" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">masculinity that we would denied to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.279" end="00:32:08.779" style="s2">concept of femininity like we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:12.500" style="s2">to a point where we&#39;re just unsure it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.779" end="00:32:15.049" style="s2">would seem as to whether or not there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.500" end="00:32:19.700" style="s2">a compelling reason for half of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.049" end="00:32:22.130" style="s2">now war of course is an easy counter to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.700" end="00:32:25.970" style="s2">that but the more distance we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.130" end="00:32:29.630" style="s2">from world war two I worry that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.970" end="00:32:32.270" style="s2">forgotten exactly why men exist in in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">terms of their full complement of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.270" end="00:32:37.640" style="s2">abilities and skills and functions do</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:39.649" style="s2">you think that there&#39;s anything to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.640" end="00:32:45.830" style="s2">concept that masculinity may be</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.649" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">intrinsically fragile they get subject</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.830" end="00:32:52.309" style="s2">to veto if you say you know if you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:54.200" style="s2">something that&#39;s heroic let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.309" end="00:32:57.799" style="s2">nobody chooses to acknowledge it or like</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.200" end="00:33:02.779" style="s2">well you&#39;re showing off you know it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.799" end="00:33:04.669" style="s2">a very hard thing to to protect do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.779" end="00:33:07.480" style="s2">detect a crisis in masculinity that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.669" end="00:33:09.770" style="s2">big topic we get a lot of young people</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.480" end="00:33:12.770" style="s2">who come to some of the shows of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.770" end="00:33:15.529" style="s2">Friends of both of ours and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.770" end="00:33:18.650" style="s2">clear that there is the search for how</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.529" end="00:33:22.280" style="s2">do I make my way as a young man</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.650" end="00:33:24.350" style="s2">are you are you getting this energy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.280" end="00:33:26.600" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t get a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.350" end="00:33:28.309" style="s2">energy all right and the reason I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.600" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">get a lot of that energy is because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.309" end="00:33:35.059" style="s2">mean I do what I do</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:37.190" style="s2">my friends they do what we do you know I</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.059" end="00:33:40.280" style="s2">think the the thing with with</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.190" end="00:33:42.890" style="s2">masculinity is just like everything else</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.280" end="00:33:44.900" style="s2">if I take any masculine trait and I take</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.890" end="00:33:47.690" style="s2">it to an extreme it turns back turn</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.900" end="00:33:49.970" style="s2">stock I and you know and I should say</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.690" end="00:33:51.650" style="s2">traditionally masculine trait because if</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.970" end="00:33:52.970" style="s2">I take any traditionally masculine trait</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.650" end="00:33:55.550" style="s2">and I take a turret extreme it turns bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.970" end="00:33:57.500" style="s2">yeah the thing is the masculine traits</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.550" end="00:34:00.650" style="s2">that we talked about but I have three</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.500" end="00:34:02.840" style="s2">daughters and one son I I raised them</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.650" end="00:34:05.990" style="s2">all the same and I want them to have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.840" end="00:34:07.610" style="s2">same amount of the masculine traits hey</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.990" end="00:34:08.450" style="s2">do I want you to be assertive yes I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.610" end="00:34:10.970" style="s2">you to be assertive that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.450" end="00:34:13.399" style="s2">traditionally masculine trait do I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.970" end="00:34:16.580" style="s2">you to be brave yes I want you to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.399" end="00:34:18.950" style="s2">brave do I want you to be stupid and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.580" end="00:34:22.310" style="s2">I&#39;d go over all that isn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.950" end="00:34:25.250" style="s2">masculine yeah we have to check with my</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.310" end="00:34:26.750" style="s2">wife on that all right but so so these</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.250" end="00:34:28.040" style="s2">but even those aren&#39;t really I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.750" end="00:34:30.110" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that assertiveness is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.040" end="00:34:32.540" style="s2">masculine trait I would say we have our</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.110" end="00:34:34.700" style="s2">flavor of assertiveness has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.540" end="00:34:39.770" style="s2">traditionally different than the female</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.700" end="00:34:41.600" style="s2">flavor but you know definitely you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.770" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">I think if my wife is one of the braver</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.600" end="00:34:45.080" style="s2">people I know and there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:47.720" style="s2">contradicts the feminine and that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.080" end="00:34:50.600" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t do it the way let&#39;s say my</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.720" end="00:34:54.409" style="s2">brother would would behave in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.600" end="00:34:59.840" style="s2">brave context and so the the question in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.409" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">some sense has to do with its you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.840" end="00:35:04.850" style="s2">give people the puzzle name some</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:07.220" style="s2">positive trait that you would associate</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.850" end="00:35:08.900" style="s2">with masculinity to distinguish it from</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.220" end="00:35:10.670" style="s2">femininity there&#39;s plenty of things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.900" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">we say that a feminine that are positive</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.670" end="00:35:14.660" style="s2">but there are very few things that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">can say are masculine that are positive</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.660" end="00:35:21.890" style="s2">without an immediate claim that that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:22.070" style="s2">as female as it is male I don&#39;t know all</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.890" end="00:35:27.620" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.070" end="00:35:29.500" style="s2">I mean III don&#39;t know I I&#39;m over here</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.620" end="00:35:31.450" style="s2">doing what I do</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.500" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.450" end="00:35:37.050" style="s2">masculine or whatever but this is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.420" end="00:35:40.660" style="s2">is kind of what I do how I live my life</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.050" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">the people that I know that are men they</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.660" end="00:35:45.250" style="s2">all seem kind of similar to me okay uh I</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:46.660" style="s2">mean not all of them obviously cuz</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.250" end="00:35:48.849" style="s2">you&#39;ve got I mean I have friends that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.660" end="00:35:53.230" style="s2">are that are not like me at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.849" end="00:35:55.090" style="s2">but yeah I don&#39;t know let&#39;s try another</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.230" end="00:35:58.750" style="s2">one I don&#39;t know if I have the best the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.090" end="00:36:03.010" style="s2">better to answer for okay what is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.750" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">that I guess I think about the few</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.010" end="00:36:08.050" style="s2">people I&#39;ve gone through life and death</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">situations with and I feel a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.050" end="00:36:14.650" style="s2">special strong bond to them that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:16.150" style="s2">catalyzed by the peril that we went</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.650" end="00:36:20.109" style="s2">through together and I watched how they</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.150" end="00:36:22.630" style="s2">performed but it wasn&#39;t in a military</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.109" end="00:36:24.099" style="s2">situation was just sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.630" end="00:36:25.960" style="s2">you&#39;re like you&#39;re out on a remote hike</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.099" end="00:36:28.840" style="s2">and people perform and they come through</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.960" end="00:36:30.220" style="s2">and you you you take that knowledge for</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.840" end="00:36:32.650" style="s2">the rest of your life that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.220" end="00:36:35.830" style="s2">somebody I can depend upon is there any</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.650" end="00:36:38.650" style="s2">substitute for putting your life at risk</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.830" end="00:36:42.369" style="s2">when it comes to deepening bonds between</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.650" end="00:36:44.020" style="s2">people particularly men going through</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.369" end="00:36:46.630" style="s2">hard things together is what brings</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.020" end="00:36:48.310" style="s2">people together and for sure the harder</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.630" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">things that you go through the tighter</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.310" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">the bonds gonna be so if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.250" style="s2">military for example to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:55.270" style="s2">military well the first thing you do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.250" end="00:36:57.820" style="s2">you put in through boot camp like we</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.270" end="00:36:59.500" style="s2">talked about well that&#39;s hard and you go</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.820" end="00:37:00.940" style="s2">and you form bonds with people that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.500" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">other people that went through boot camp</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.940" end="00:37:05.500" style="s2">we all kind of have that common bond</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.760" style="s2">then you go to Airborne School where</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.500" end="00:37:08.260" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna jump out of airplanes and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.760" end="00:37:10.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit of a death-defying</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.260" end="00:37:11.950" style="s2">thing and you&#39;re gonna be the airborne</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.630" end="00:37:13.869" style="s2">crews are gonna be a little bit tighter</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.950" end="00:37:14.710" style="s2">you go to Special Operations training</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.869" end="00:37:16.410" style="s2">and all of a sudden you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.710" end="00:37:18.339" style="s2">something that&#39;s harder than that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.410" end="00:37:19.990" style="s2">and now the bombs are a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.339" end="00:37:22.180" style="s2">tighter now you take that unit and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.990" end="00:37:23.770" style="s2">put them in the combat zone and their</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.180" end="00:37:25.720" style="s2">bonds are gonna be even tighter now you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.770" end="00:37:27.849" style="s2">take that combat zone and you make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.720" end="00:37:30.010" style="s2">super intense those bonds are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.849" end="00:37:31.480" style="s2">even tighter so there&#39;s no doubt about</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.010" end="00:37:33.160" style="s2">it now in the business world what that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.480" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">looks like and especially I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.160" end="00:37:38.260" style="s2">retired in 2010 so the companies that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:39.780" style="s2">worked with a lot of them the companies</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.260" end="00:37:41.829" style="s2">that we work with were many of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.780" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">survivors of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.829" end="00:37:45.969" style="s2">economic crash and believe me they</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:47.529" style="s2">talked about that like that was their</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.969" end="00:37:49.029" style="s2">battle zone that&#39;s where they formed</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.529" end="00:37:50.619" style="s2">these really tight bonds and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.029" end="00:37:54.309" style="s2">weren&#39;t going anywhere now they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.619" end="00:37:56.920" style="s2">tight so whether you can replace it I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.309" end="00:37:58.329" style="s2">don&#39;t really think so I think the harder</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.920" end="00:38:00.309" style="s2">strife you go through with someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.329" end="00:38:02.489" style="s2">the tighter the bond is gonna be and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.309" end="00:38:04.690" style="s2">maybe over time you form a strong bond</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.489" end="00:38:06.219" style="s2">you know if I had to rely on you for</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.690" end="00:38:08.349" style="s2">something and you came through for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.219" end="00:38:10.059" style="s2">and then you did it again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.349" end="00:38:11.709" style="s2">then I did it for you and we we stuck</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.059" end="00:38:14.469" style="s2">together I mean over time you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.709" end="00:38:16.779" style="s2">definitely form really really strong</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.469" end="00:38:18.609" style="s2">bonds with people but I think the harder</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.779" end="00:38:20.289" style="s2">something is the stronger the bonds if</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.609" end="00:38:22.450" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t fracture you if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.289" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">break you right well then you have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.450" end="00:38:26.619" style="s2">guy you&#39;ll never speak to again because</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:29.709" style="s2">where were you when I needed you exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.619" end="00:38:31.539" style="s2">right my concern though I mean let me</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.709" end="00:38:33.009" style="s2">just open up about the fact that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.539" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">least favorite phrase in the English</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.009" end="00:38:37.479" style="s2">language at the moment is I&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:39.910" style="s2">back and the reason is because I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.479" end="00:38:42.369" style="s2">it migrated from the military into</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.910" end="00:38:44.410" style="s2">civilian life where civilians have no</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.369" end="00:38:46.809" style="s2">idea what it means they think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.410" end="00:38:48.969" style="s2">like it&#39;s a good thing to say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.809" end="00:38:50.170" style="s2">I really care about you and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.969" end="00:38:51.670" style="s2">anything bad to happen but it has</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.170" end="00:38:56.349" style="s2">nothing to do with I&#39;ve actually got</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.670" end="00:38:59.410" style="s2">your back do you find that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.349" end="00:39:02.650" style="s2">kind of military envy and bleed where</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.410" end="00:39:04.630" style="s2">people talk as if they&#39;re in these</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.650" end="00:39:08.559" style="s2">situations and it actually just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.630" end="00:39:11.229" style="s2">match in any way I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.559" end="00:39:13.749" style="s2">envy or if it&#39;s just slang terms that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.229" end="00:39:15.160" style="s2">expand over time mean there&#39;s slang</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.749" end="00:39:17.410" style="s2">terms that we use all the time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.160" end="00:39:19.690" style="s2">farming sports and the military provide</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.410" end="00:39:21.729" style="s2">a lot of language right right yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.690" end="00:39:24.130" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think that when someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.729" end="00:39:27.489" style="s2">says I got your back you know you and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.130" end="00:39:29.289" style="s2">are are you know hey can you I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.489" end="00:39:31.089" style="s2">go to McDonald&#39;s right you know I got</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.289" end="00:39:32.650" style="s2">your back you need anything you know let</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.089" end="00:39:35.289" style="s2">me grab you some chicken nuggets over</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.650" end="00:39:36.819" style="s2">here I don&#39;t think that my intent and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.289" end="00:39:39.579" style="s2">saying that wouldn&#39;t be like hey brother</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.819" end="00:39:41.619" style="s2">I got your back with the chicken nuggets</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.579" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">deep you know I I think it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.619" end="00:39:45.069" style="s2">slang thing that people are thrown</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:48.069" style="s2">around yeah I percent I think it rhymes</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.069" end="00:39:49.749" style="s2">up in a situation in which like you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.069" end="00:39:52.059" style="s2">the boss is gonna come and ask a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.749" end="00:39:54.099" style="s2">of questions and one guy says I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.059" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">worry I got your back and he immediately</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.099" end="00:39:58.600" style="s2">folds</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:40:01.390" style="s2">because he did not even think about what</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.600" end="00:40:02.470" style="s2">he was saying and I think in part one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.390" end="00:40:04.120" style="s2">the fears I have and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.470" end="00:40:08.110" style="s2">whether you resonate with this is that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.120" end="00:40:11.340" style="s2">think a lot of American men men in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.110" end="00:40:13.900" style="s2">developed world don&#39;t have any bonds</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.340" end="00:40:15.130" style="s2">that are comparable to the bonds that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.900" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about in other words</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.130" end="00:40:22.710" style="s2">their closest friend is untested in any</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">real way yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s uh not good</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.710" end="00:40:28.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not good you definitely want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:31.390" style="s2">have some friends that you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.690" end="00:40:34.360" style="s2">call them they will answer and when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.390" end="00:40:35.500" style="s2">make a request they will deliver and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.360" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">don&#39;t need a big group of friends like</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.500" end="00:40:40.570" style="s2">that but it&#39;s nice to have a few and one</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:43.180" style="s2">of the things that I&#39;m curious about is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.570" end="00:40:47.080" style="s2">that I&#39;m seeing kids not be allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.180" end="00:40:48.490" style="s2">work out their own problems and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.080" end="00:40:50.770" style="s2">they&#39;re taught if that anything goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.490" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">wrong immediately go find an authority</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.770" end="00:40:56.050" style="s2">figure and as a result I worry that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:57.460" style="s2">these kids are never gonna have those</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.050" end="00:40:59.080" style="s2">strong bonds because you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.460" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">into trouble and out of trouble</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.080" end="00:41:02.320" style="s2">repeatedly with the same people do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">think there&#39;s anything to that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.320" end="00:41:07.540" style="s2">definitely form good bonds doing hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:09.160" style="s2">things and also would you get in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.540" end="00:41:11.560" style="s2">can you let spirit is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.160" end="00:41:14.260" style="s2">that you got in trouble for that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.560" end="00:41:15.880" style="s2">discuss from like before you enter the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.260" end="00:41:17.500" style="s2">military yeah I mean I you know just</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.880" end="00:41:19.270" style="s2">every other knucklehead thing that every</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.500" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">other boy was doing when they&#39;re 13 14</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.270" end="00:41:25.960" style="s2">15 years old such as whether it was you</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:29.500" style="s2">know blowing up fireworks driving like</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:32.380" style="s2">maniacs just every stupid thing fighting</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.500" end="00:41:35.770" style="s2">you know big giant street fights it just</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.380" end="00:41:38.200" style="s2">dumb stuff and yeah I did it all like an</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.770" end="00:41:39.160" style="s2">idiot like a like a 14 year old boy like</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.200" end="00:41:43.060" style="s2">a 15 year old boy</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.160" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">did you enjoy street fighting yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.060" end="00:41:48.330" style="s2">can you so there it&#39;s a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:52.030" style="s2">violence with probably very little point</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.330" end="00:41:55.150" style="s2">but the pleasure of fighting you know I</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.030" end="00:41:57.970" style="s2">think it was PJ O&#39;Rourke who pointed me</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.150" end="00:42:00.010" style="s2">to it&#39;s one of his writings that he said</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.970" end="00:42:02.230" style="s2">we used to discuss the drunk delight of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.010" end="00:42:05.370" style="s2">battle before we decided that war was</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.230" end="00:42:05.370" style="s2">generally a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.720" end="00:42:14.150" style="s2">you know I think people like competition</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:16.609" style="s2">right and you know there&#39;s no more</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.150" end="00:42:19.099" style="s2">heightened form of competition</p>

<p begin="00:44:14.770" end="00:44:18.610" style="s2">three things that really help me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.380" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">gonna give a speech at my friend&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.610" end="00:44:23.230" style="s2">wedding yeah he was getting married and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:24.550" style="s2">he was a guy that I had trained</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.230" end="00:44:28.030" style="s2">jiu-jitsu with a lot he&#39;s a guy I went</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.550" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">to combat with and in now I was at his</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.030" end="00:44:31.690" style="s2">wedding he&#39;s getting married and I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">giving the speech and what I said was</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.690" end="00:44:39.340" style="s2">there was three things in my life that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:42.670" style="s2">sort of made me feel secure as a man</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.340" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">okay and the first one was learning how</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.670" end="00:44:48.130" style="s2">to fight so like learning jiu-jitsu and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:51.100" style="s2">knowing that hey if I get into a fight</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.130" end="00:44:53.410" style="s2">with someone I can handle myself that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.100" end="00:44:55.890" style="s2">was number one number two was going into</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.410" end="00:44:59.230" style="s2">combat because when you go into combat</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.890" end="00:45:01.840" style="s2">you you want to know that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.230" end="00:45:03.880" style="s2">perform your duties and you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.840" end="00:45:06.220" style="s2">cower and you&#39;re gonna be brave and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.880" end="00:45:09.820" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do your job so went to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.220" end="00:45:13.480" style="s2">combat I was good with it I liked it it</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.820" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">was fine and then the last one was I got</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.480" end="00:45:17.320" style="s2">married and had kids and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:19.450" style="s2">now I&#39;ve got people that depend on me</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.320" end="00:45:21.010" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got people that are a higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.450" end="00:45:23.590" style="s2">priority than me ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.010" end="00:45:26.109" style="s2">then I will ever be and so those three</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.590" end="00:45:28.780" style="s2">things were very important to me feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.109" end="00:45:31.000" style="s2">secure and and you know I always say</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.780" end="00:45:32.320" style="s2">when I was young and stupid and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.000" end="00:45:34.450" style="s2">know how to fight I used to fight all</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.320" end="00:45:36.280" style="s2">the time and then once I learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.450" end="00:45:38.020" style="s2">fight I didn&#39;t fight anymore because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.280" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">have anything to prove anymore you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.020" end="00:45:41.260" style="s2">I I&#39;m not trying to prove that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:43.330" style="s2">tougher than you and outside the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.260" end="00:45:45.250" style="s2">7-eleven it&#39;s like hey if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.330" end="00:45:47.320" style="s2">find out who&#39;s tougher come to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.250" end="00:45:49.930" style="s2">gym and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get on the mat and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.320" end="00:45:53.590" style="s2">see you so you would win but let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.930" end="00:45:55.180" style="s2">do it in the street like like dummies so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.590" end="00:45:59.050" style="s2">those three things I think are helpful</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.180" end="00:46:01.240" style="s2">for people to do they were helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.050" end="00:46:03.369" style="s2">me I know that they were helpful you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.240" end="00:46:04.630" style="s2">know as a young insecure kid which</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.369" end="00:46:06.430" style="s2">that&#39;s what you that&#39;s what kids are</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.630" end="00:46:07.960" style="s2">they&#39;re insecure with who they are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.430" end="00:46:10.420" style="s2">know that no one&#39;s walking around at age</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.960" end="00:46:12.220" style="s2">15 thinking you know I&#39;m the man and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.420" end="00:46:13.869" style="s2">when they project that which I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.220" end="00:46:15.340" style="s2">tried to project what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.869" end="00:46:18.340" style="s2">projecting is I&#39;m pretty insecure about</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.340" end="00:46:20.890" style="s2">what&#39;s going on right now okay cool how</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.340" end="00:46:23.020" style="s2">are you gonna get over that then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.890" end="00:46:25.060" style="s2">don&#39;t learn how to fight learn what that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.020" end="00:46:26.320" style="s2">feels like take responsibility for you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.060" end="00:46:27.830" style="s2">know when you have a wife and kids so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.320" end="00:46:31.610" style="s2">you have a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.830" end="00:46:33.470" style="s2">big one so those are things that I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.610" end="00:46:35.330" style="s2">move you in the right direction so if I</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.470" end="00:46:38.660" style="s2">take that sequence right the first one</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.330" end="00:46:41.510" style="s2">is learning theoretically to be capable</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.660" end="00:46:43.970" style="s2">in a fight so that you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.510" end="00:46:46.190" style="s2">worry that if something happens you need</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.970" end="00:46:48.950" style="s2">to back down instantly you can assess</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.190" end="00:46:51.190" style="s2">the situation figure out how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.950" end="00:46:53.510" style="s2">handle it on your own terms hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.190" end="00:46:56.060" style="s2">but then you say the second thing which</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.510" end="00:47:00.110" style="s2">is beyond being able to fight</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.060" end="00:47:04.580" style="s2">I really enjoy door combat helped make</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.110" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">me who I am can you talk about and feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.580" end="00:47:12.760" style="s2">free not to if it&#39;s not right what what</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:16.580" style="s2">is the sort of the poetry of combat that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.760" end="00:47:18.140" style="s2">allows you to more fully develop that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.580" end="00:47:20.420" style="s2">allowed you to more fully develop as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.140" end="00:47:22.070" style="s2">human being beyond the ability let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.420" end="00:47:24.950" style="s2">to just handle yourself in a fight where</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.070" end="00:47:27.740" style="s2">you&#39;re actually applying this now with</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.950" end="00:47:31.160" style="s2">leverage in terms of weaponry in terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.740" end="00:47:34.490" style="s2">of command in terms of strategy tactics</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.160" end="00:47:35.930" style="s2">in a life-and-death situation you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.490" end="00:47:39.170" style="s2">all that stuff that you just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.930" end="00:47:42.230" style="s2">mm-hmm I absolutely love and I&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.170" end="00:47:45.410" style="s2">my entire life trying to get good at</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.230" end="00:47:47.750" style="s2">tactics with weapons maneuver on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.410" end="00:47:48.890" style="s2">battlefield combat leadership and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.750" end="00:47:52.970" style="s2">those things are awesome and that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.890" end="00:47:56.420" style="s2">certainly the the the things in combat</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.970" end="00:47:58.700" style="s2">that you get to experience but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.420" end="00:48:00.530" style="s2">bottom line is is this when you go into</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.700" end="00:48:02.690" style="s2">combat you got people that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.530" end="00:48:06.940" style="s2">kill you and at some point you realize</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.690" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">okay I could die tonight and if I die</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.940" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">bring it and I think for me you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:17.630" style="s2">the idea you know people people go</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:20.870" style="s2">through life they they you got death out</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.630" end="00:48:22.970" style="s2">there in the future and they either</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.870" end="00:48:24.710" style="s2">don&#39;t want to face it or it&#39;s so far</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.970" end="00:48:27.080" style="s2">away that they they don&#39;t need to face</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.710" end="00:48:29.660" style="s2">it or they put it in the back of their</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.080" end="00:48:32.660" style="s2">mind well when you go into war it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.660" end="00:48:34.370" style="s2">coming to the front of your mind and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.660" end="00:48:36.080" style="s2">get to answer that question that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.370" end="00:48:37.820" style="s2">some people wait their whole lives to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.080" end="00:48:39.890" style="s2">answer is what am I going to do when</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.820" end="00:48:41.630" style="s2">it&#39;s time to die and once you answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.890" end="00:48:46.420" style="s2">that question for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.630" end="00:48:50.780" style="s2">then for me I was like okay you know III</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.330" end="00:49:54.370" style="s2">you don&#39;t most people don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.950" end="00:49:56.950" style="s2">they they&#39;ve imagined the death is this</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.370" end="00:49:59.540" style="s2">incredibly remote thing they don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.950" end="00:50:03.290" style="s2">bodies or there are fewer open caskets</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.540" end="00:50:05.120" style="s2">probably we we cremate people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.290" end="00:50:07.790" style="s2">visit graves there are all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.120" end="00:50:09.830" style="s2">things that are keeping us in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.790" end="00:50:13.100" style="s2">abstraction where death seems very very</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.830" end="00:50:16.040" style="s2">remote are you saying that combat was</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.100" end="00:50:19.220" style="s2">liberating specifically because you were</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.040" end="00:50:21.890" style="s2">forced to say I am playing with the full</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.220" end="00:50:23.720" style="s2">stack and I&#39;ve accepted that and your</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.890" end="00:50:26.870" style="s2">comment bring it I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.720" end="00:50:29.330" style="s2">terrifying thing to say in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.870" end="00:50:30.470" style="s2">life-and-death situation how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.330" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">do you how do you see that if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.470" end="00:50:37.820" style="s2">crossed over some threshold I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:39.380" style="s2">a matter of acceptance of accepting the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.820" end="00:50:41.270" style="s2">fact that this is what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.380" end="00:50:43.130" style="s2">happen and you know you talk about not</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.270" end="00:50:45.590" style="s2">visiting graves I mean I visit my</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.130" end="00:50:48.590" style="s2">friends graves all the time I go to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.590" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">national cemeteries and I see you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.590" end="00:50:53.180" style="s2">that there&#39;ll be some some person who</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:55.069" style="s2">died in like let&#39;s say the 50s or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.180" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">40s and there are fresh flowers on</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.069" end="00:51:01.099" style="s2">that particular grave is very moving so</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:05.109" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if liberating is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.099" end="00:51:08.719" style="s2">word but perhaps it is but I think again</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.109" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">and you know Sam Harris he asked a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.719" end="00:51:14.119" style="s2">pointed question on his podcast he said</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.609" style="s2">you know you talk about war being hell</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.119" end="00:51:19.880" style="s2">which I do and and being awful which I</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.609" end="00:51:23.509" style="s2">do and which it is and then you know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.880" end="00:51:25.130" style="s2">say that combat was like the best time</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.509" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">that I&#39;ve had in my life and he says how</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.130" end="00:51:31.400" style="s2">do you reconcile those two statements</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:32.690" style="s2">and and what I said to him was I asked</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.400" end="00:51:36.769" style="s2">him if he ever knew anyone that had</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.690" end="00:51:40.130" style="s2">cancer and that had cancer and lived and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.769" end="00:51:43.549" style="s2">he said yes and I said and when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.130" end="00:51:46.489" style="s2">those people they&#39;re they very often</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.549" end="00:51:48.259" style="s2">give the answer I&#39;m glad it happened to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.489" end="00:51:50.900" style="s2">me this is what I learned from it they</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.259" end="00:51:54.259" style="s2">had to face death and once they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.900" end="00:51:55.819" style="s2">through it they realized you know they</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.259" end="00:51:57.859" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t wish it on their best on their</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.819" end="00:51:59.539" style="s2">worst enemy but they&#39;re they&#39;re glad</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.859" end="00:52:02.359" style="s2">that they went through it because they</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.539" end="00:52:04.219" style="s2">learned and I think I said that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.359" end="00:52:07.009" style="s2">what combat is like you have to face</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.219" end="00:52:09.199" style="s2">your own mortality and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.009" end="00:52:12.049" style="s2">recognize that you know you could die</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.199" end="00:52:13.910" style="s2">and then when you&#39;re done you get back</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.049" end="00:52:15.890" style="s2">and you realize that the Sun coming up</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.910" end="00:52:20.410" style="s2">in the morning is a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.890" end="00:52:25.339" style="s2">I can imagine what about so you were</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.410" end="00:52:28.789" style="s2">most associated in my mind with with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.339" end="00:52:31.519" style="s2">Iraqi theater and what I wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.789" end="00:52:34.729" style="s2">you about is what was in your estimation</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.519" end="00:52:39.039" style="s2">what was unusual and peculiar about</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.729" end="00:52:42.319" style="s2">operating in that theater at that time</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.039" end="00:52:44.209" style="s2">and and what did you bring back from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.319" end="00:52:45.199" style="s2">particularity of that experience it</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.209" end="00:52:48.769" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been the same if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.199" end="00:52:50.779" style="s2">been in Afghanistan or posted somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.769" end="00:52:53.199" style="s2">else one thing that&#39;s interesting is I</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.779" end="00:52:55.759" style="s2">do two deployments to Iraq and and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.199" end="00:52:58.279" style="s2">amount that the battlefield changes all</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.759" end="00:53:00.289" style="s2">the time how quickly the enemy adapts</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.279" end="00:53:02.329" style="s2">and then how coalition forces have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.289" end="00:53:04.039" style="s2">adapt to what the enemy adapted to and</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.329" end="00:53:06.109" style="s2">that&#39;s a cycle that just doesn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.039" end="00:53:07.819" style="s2">and so you you&#39;re constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.109" end="00:53:08.190" style="s2">keep your eyes open and be humble about</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.819" end="00:53:09.089" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.190" end="00:53:11.220" style="s2">the enemy&#39;s doing and never</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.089" end="00:53:15.329" style="s2">underestimate what their capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.220" end="00:53:16.890" style="s2">are as far as the operating theater my</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.329" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">first deployment I was all over the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.890" end="00:53:22.200" style="s2">country we operated all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:23.910" style="s2">and I was living in Baghdad or we were</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.200" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">we had our compound wasn&#39;t in Baghdad</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.910" end="00:53:28.410" style="s2">and then but I waited all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:30.810" style="s2">and we travel and fly and drive</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.410" end="00:53:34.349" style="s2">everywhere in Iraq or to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.810" end="00:53:35.579" style="s2">different places and then my second</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.349" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">deployment where we were in the Battle</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.579" end="00:53:37.650" style="s2">of Ramadi</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:40.410" style="s2">I didn&#39;t leave Ramadi and then leave</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.650" end="00:53:43.140" style="s2">that little you know three four square</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.410" end="00:53:45.180" style="s2">miles of neighborhoods and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.140" end="00:53:47.490" style="s2">very different and who are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.180" end="00:53:49.410" style="s2">belligerents on both sides was Isis on</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.490" end="00:53:51.980" style="s2">the other side though my first</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.410" end="00:53:56.869" style="s2">deployment what it was was a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.980" end="00:54:00.900" style="s2">thugs criminals former regime elements</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.869" end="00:54:04.770" style="s2">running around causing problems and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.900" end="00:54:08.520" style="s2">were very disorganized mmm so that was</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.770" end="00:54:11.250" style="s2">in 2003 2004 by 2006 when I went back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.520" end="00:54:13.589" style="s2">Ramadi when I went to Ramadi that was</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.250" end="00:54:16.829" style="s2">now a full-fledged insurgency that was</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.589" end="00:54:18.740" style="s2">organized and financed and led and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.829" end="00:54:21.300" style="s2">were operating as a paramilitary</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.740" end="00:54:23.940" style="s2">organization and the same folks who had</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.300" end="00:54:25.290" style="s2">gotten disciplined the same folks but</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.940" end="00:54:27.060" style="s2">they had gotten disciplined that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.290" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to figure out yes the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.060" end="00:54:31.020" style="s2">folks disciplined but more important</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:32.819" style="s2">they had leadership now because al-qaeda</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.020" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">started bringing in foreign fighters</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.819" end="00:54:37.410" style="s2">foreign leadership to go in and run and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:39.300" style="s2">direct operations and that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.410" end="00:54:40.800" style="s2">when you have a an organization without</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.300" end="00:54:43.020" style="s2">leadership isn&#39;t an organization at all</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.800" end="00:54:45.119" style="s2">I&#39;m sure they can they can nipa you and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.020" end="00:54:47.250" style="s2">they can do some random attacks and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.119" end="00:54:49.589" style="s2">that&#39;ll be problematic but once you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.250" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">organize an element and you put</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.589" end="00:54:52.230" style="s2">leadership over them then that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:54:53.790" style="s2">they could start to do real damage and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.230" end="00:54:55.589" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what happened and where</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.790" end="00:54:59.880" style="s2">was the experience coming from was it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.589" end="00:55:02.510" style="s2">Chechnya or all over all over from yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.880" end="00:55:02.510" style="s2">from all over</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.580" end="00:55:10.080" style="s2">one of the things we talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.260" end="00:55:14.310" style="s2">world war 2 is the sense of being the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.080" end="00:55:16.320" style="s2">good guys and I think in the era that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.310" end="00:55:18.050" style="s2">followed World War 2 we were less</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.320" end="00:55:20.370" style="s2">convinced that we were always</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.050" end="00:55:22.110" style="s2">intrinsically the good guys but you had</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.370" end="00:55:27.270" style="s2">the opportunity to go up against some of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.110" end="00:55:29.130" style="s2">the most horrible people we&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.270" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">in modern times is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.130" end="00:55:35.490" style="s2">characterization of the of the enemy yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:38.570" style="s2">can you talk about and I would actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.490" end="00:55:43.820" style="s2">like to do it somewhat unflinchingly</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.570" end="00:55:46.850" style="s2">what distinguished Isis in terms of I</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.820" end="00:55:49.620" style="s2">talk about a concept most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.850" end="00:55:52.170" style="s2">react to called message violence where</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.620" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">the point of the violence is to be so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.170" end="00:55:56.970" style="s2">picturesque that it works its way into</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:55:59.960" style="s2">your mind and it won&#39;t let you go</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.970" end="00:56:03.030" style="s2">because somebody did something that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.960" end="00:56:05.010" style="s2">unnecessarily unthinkable just for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.030" end="00:56:06.600" style="s2">purpose of torturing your brain with</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.010" end="00:56:09.830" style="s2">knowing that that&#39;s what&#39;s on the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.600" end="00:56:14.040" style="s2">side is is that a fair characterization</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.830" end="00:56:16.830" style="s2">yeah so the term Isis started being used</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.040" end="00:56:20.280" style="s2">around 2007 I my last deployment ended</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.830" end="00:56:22.320" style="s2">in 2006 but the characters are still the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.280" end="00:56:24.390" style="s2">same and they were they weren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.320" end="00:56:26.910" style="s2">organized as they became when they</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.390" end="00:56:29.550" style="s2">became Isis when they started flying the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.910" end="00:56:31.170" style="s2">ISIS flag and then what you had was this</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.550" end="00:56:35.070" style="s2">recruitment there&#39;s a worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.170" end="00:56:39.530" style="s2">recruitment of of sadistic evil human</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.070" end="00:56:41.900" style="s2">beings coming to the the Caliphate to</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.530" end="00:56:45.840" style="s2">torture and murder and rape</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.900" end="00:56:50.610" style="s2">systematically girls and boys and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.840" end="00:56:53.460" style="s2">but what we saw in in Ramadi in 2006 was</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.610" end="00:56:55.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the worst nightmares that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.460" end="00:56:59.460" style="s2">can imagine from people being skinned</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.710" end="00:57:01.080" style="s2">alive people being beheaded people being</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.460" end="00:57:03.930" style="s2">tortured in all manners</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.080" end="00:57:06.630" style="s2">rape you know rape used as a weapon of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.930" end="00:57:08.870" style="s2">war just everything every horrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.630" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">that you can family members being</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.870" end="00:57:13.890" style="s2">violated in front of other family</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:16.290" style="s2">absolutely and and that&#39;s why you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.890" end="00:57:18.600" style="s2">for us when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.290" end="00:57:20.070" style="s2">did you feel like the good guys oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.600" end="00:57:21.540" style="s2">we definitely felt like the good guys</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.070" end="00:57:23.580" style="s2">and we especially felt like the good</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.540" end="00:57:26.550" style="s2">guys because the local populace is who</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.580" end="00:57:28.560" style="s2">was enduring this this this heinous</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.550" end="00:57:30.090" style="s2">these heinous acts was the local</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.560" end="00:57:32.700" style="s2">populace though the local people that</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.090" end="00:57:34.380" style="s2">lived in ramadi that&#39;s who was enduring</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.700" end="00:57:36.360" style="s2">and suffering these horrible acts so</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.380" end="00:57:38.760" style="s2">when we came in and started eliminating</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.360" end="00:57:40.470" style="s2">the insurgents they were ecstatic and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.760" end="00:57:41.850" style="s2">they were happy that we were there and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.470" end="00:57:44.700" style="s2">they believed me they wanted nothing</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.850" end="00:57:47.610" style="s2">more than for to help us get those</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.700" end="00:57:50.660" style="s2">insurgents out of the city and out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.610" end="00:57:53.070" style="s2">the country what is it that you think</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.660" end="00:57:56.670" style="s2">you know you mentioned the caliphate and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.070" end="00:58:00.930" style="s2">my fear is is that the caliphate was</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.670" end="00:58:04.680" style="s2">sort of a remote dream and that what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.930" end="00:58:10.080" style="s2">allowed to happen was that the caliphate</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.680" end="00:58:12.660" style="s2">came to be a potential reality in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.080" end="00:58:15.240" style="s2">world of people who hadn&#39;t been used to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.660" end="00:58:17.220" style="s2">thinking about it until recently that in</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.240" end="00:58:19.380" style="s2">essence there been a couple of major</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.220" end="00:58:21.030" style="s2">shifts in the Islamic world one is for</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.380" end="00:58:23.970" style="s2">example the suicide bombing was an</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.030" end="00:58:26.430" style="s2">almost unknown before the Lebanese</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.970" end="00:58:29.570" style="s2">barracks and then it was perfected in</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.430" end="00:58:32.370" style="s2">Sri Lanka by the Tamil rebels against</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.570" end="00:58:34.290" style="s2">against the Sinhalese yeah populist well</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.370" end="00:58:36.180" style="s2">and actually is back to the not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.290" end="00:58:37.950" style="s2">in Sri Lanka I mean this Sri Lankan the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.180" end="00:58:39.480" style="s2">Tamils Tigers there was two meals that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.950" end="00:58:41.130" style="s2">were in the sin Elise or that were in</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.480" end="00:58:43.500" style="s2">the Sri Lankan army right so it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.130" end="00:58:46.590" style="s2">all it wasn&#39;t all it wasn&#39;t pure it</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.500" end="00:58:49.890" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a pure ethnic the tactic was was</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.590" end="00:58:52.470" style="s2">very strange in the way in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.890" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">been a relatively modern invention and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.470" end="00:58:58.770" style="s2">then it came back to the Middle East and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:59:02.910" style="s2">that together with the concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.770" end="00:59:05.850" style="s2">caliphate started to animate a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.910" end="00:59:08.490" style="s2">sleeping islamic identity that hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.850" end="00:59:10.800" style="s2">been wildly present I mean I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.490" end="00:59:13.770" style="s2">analogize it to what would happen in</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.800" end="00:59:14.520" style="s2">Judaism if somebody started rebuilding</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.770" end="00:59:17.250" style="s2">the temple</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.520" end="00:59:19.010" style="s2">and all of this room code that has not</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.250" end="00:59:21.480" style="s2">never been run like where you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.010" end="00:59:23.610" style="s2">reconvene the sanhedrin&#39;s to mete out</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.480" end="00:59:26.220" style="s2">death penalties according to Jewish law</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.610" end="00:59:29.250" style="s2">thank God we don&#39;t have a third temple</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.220" end="00:59:30.590" style="s2">right but somehow that we we let this</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.250" end="00:59:34.620" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.590" end="00:59:37.260" style="s2">go from fantasy to some kind of reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.620" end="00:59:38.700" style="s2">is that is that wrong that somehow we</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.260" end="00:59:40.950" style="s2">allowed something to animate this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.700" end="00:59:43.320" style="s2">portion of the world and it went very</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.950" end="00:59:45.710" style="s2">sadistic and psychopathic I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.320" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">wrong that we allowed that to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.710" end="00:59:52.740" style="s2">it was it was clear to people that had</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:56.100" style="s2">been in Iraq that there was embers of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.740" end="00:59:58.020" style="s2">the insurgency of this of this sadistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.100" end="01:00:01.800" style="s2">insurgency that there were embers that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.020" end="01:00:04.620" style="s2">were still burning when we pulled out</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.800" end="01:00:05.940" style="s2">hmm and so once we pulled out all of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.620" end="01:00:08.430" style="s2">sudden you know the fire the firemen</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.940" end="01:00:09.270" style="s2">there was a firehouse they came spread</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.430" end="01:00:11.120" style="s2">some water on it</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.270" end="01:00:13.590" style="s2">the flames were gone and then they left</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.120" end="01:00:15.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what we did well the fires not</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.590" end="01:00:17.190" style="s2">out yet right right and so then it</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.540" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t take long for those embers to</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.190" end="01:00:25.320" style="s2">rekindle and start completely burning</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:27.540" style="s2">out of control and then we we let it get</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.320" end="01:00:30.980" style="s2">to a point where I mean in in the city</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.540" end="01:00:34.500" style="s2">of Ramadi we we had people that we knew</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.980" end="01:00:38.810" style="s2">who when when Isis took over Ramadi</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.500" end="01:00:41.670" style="s2">which Ramadi was peaceful from 2007 till</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.810" end="01:00:45.450" style="s2">2014-2015 like completely peaceful when</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.670" end="01:00:47.700" style="s2">Isis came in they rounded up about five</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.450" end="01:00:48.870" style="s2">hundred families that had families</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.700" end="01:00:50.550" style="s2">members who had worked with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.870" end="01:00:57.800" style="s2">coalition forces and then they murdered</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.550" end="01:01:02.130" style="s2">them all right so justjust sick sadistic</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.800" end="01:01:04.230" style="s2">subhuman beings that should never have</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.130" end="01:01:07.590" style="s2">been allowed to do that now they did it</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.230" end="01:01:11.880" style="s2">and once they did and they took Ramadi</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.590" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">and they took Mosul you know when Iraqi</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.880" end="01:01:16.890" style="s2">forces went back in with the support of</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:20.370" style="s2">heavy American firepower they clean</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.890" end="01:01:22.350" style="s2">those places out and and it took I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.370" end="01:01:24.690" style="s2">they wiped out about 40,000 Isis</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.350" end="01:01:28.740" style="s2">fighters which is pretty much all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.690" end="01:01:31.530" style="s2">them pretty unique situation where they</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.740" end="01:01:34.590" style="s2">skilled fighters some of them were but</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.530" end="01:01:37.560" style="s2">what was interesting is you had them</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.590" end="01:01:38.910" style="s2">wearing uniforms carrying flags and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.560" end="01:01:41.160" style="s2">trying to act like a conventional</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.910" end="01:01:43.210" style="s2">military force in many ways not always</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.160" end="01:01:45.760" style="s2">but in many ways and</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.210" end="01:01:47.980" style="s2">so you know you want to get new</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.760" end="01:01:51.099" style="s2">conventional war with basically with</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.980" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">America that&#39;s not a good tactic but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.099" end="01:01:55.390" style="s2">was a good tactic for us for them to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.010" style="s2">that right because you know fighting an</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.390" end="01:02:00.339" style="s2">insurgency is much more difficult than</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.010" end="01:02:02.830" style="s2">fighting an open conventional war now I</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.339" end="01:02:05.099" style="s2">have a very unpopular opinion in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.830" end="01:02:08.890" style="s2">country which is somewhat popular</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.099" end="01:02:12.220" style="s2">outside of it which is that Saddam</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.890" end="01:02:15.220" style="s2">Hussein while a horrible in all the ways</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.220" end="01:02:18.820" style="s2">that we claim he was horrible was in</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.220" end="01:02:23.380" style="s2">fact holding together some powder keg</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.820" end="01:02:28.030" style="s2">and that was using it was a relatively</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.380" end="01:02:31.109" style="s2">secular government and that brought some</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.030" end="01:02:36.040" style="s2">order to a potentially very chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.109" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">communal situation his sons of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.040" end="01:02:40.690" style="s2">were you know one and one in particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:42.220" style="s2">was a stone-cold psychopath and he you</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.690" end="01:02:43.810" style="s2">know Saddam Hussein did terrible</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.220" end="01:02:46.119" style="s2">horrible things by American standards</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.810" end="01:02:49.119" style="s2">but if we evaluated him by the standards</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.920" end="01:02:56.440" style="s2">that he&#39;s obviously a bad guy he</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.730" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">certainly provided stability for the</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.440" end="01:03:01.869" style="s2">region no doubt about that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:07.240" style="s2">have you ever seen the video by which he</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.240" end="01:03:14.170" style="s2">shows up on stage smoking a cigar and he</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.300" end="01:03:15.940" style="s2">says we have a special guest today and</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.170" end="01:03:17.859" style="s2">this guy comes to the microphone and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.940" end="01:03:20.890" style="s2">starts saying I&#39;ve plotted against</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.859" end="01:03:24.640" style="s2">Saddam and I&#39;m here to read the names of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.890" end="01:03:27.190" style="s2">my co-conspirators and you see panic</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.640" end="01:03:28.599" style="s2">take over and the audience and names are</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.190" end="01:03:32.230" style="s2">called and people are let out of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.599" end="01:03:33.730" style="s2">auditorium and people start to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.230" end="01:03:36.940" style="s2">understand that everyone who&#39;s let out</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.730" end="01:03:38.830" style="s2">is going to be killed yep and so they</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.940" end="01:03:40.599" style="s2">starts screaming like you know long live</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.830" end="01:03:42.910" style="s2">Saddam we love Saddam in order to save</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.599" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">their own lives my understanding is is</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.910" end="01:03:47.320" style="s2">that the people who were left were given</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:51.310" style="s2">sidearms to execute the people who had</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.320" end="01:03:54.750" style="s2">been let out to consolidate power around</p>

<p begin="01:03:55.530" end="01:04:01.590" style="s2">to me that&#39;s an example of this message</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.480" end="01:04:05.040" style="s2">violence concept that for people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.590" end="01:04:07.290" style="s2">don&#39;t speak other languages violence and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.040" end="01:04:10.980" style="s2">even sadistic language is their poetry</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.290" end="01:04:12.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s poetry in which our fighters</p>

<p begin="01:04:24.390" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">of looking at this that&#39;s profitable</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.340" end="01:04:33.030" style="s2">that people who have not been in battle</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:34.950" style="s2">can understand about how how these</p>

<p begin="01:04:52.770" end="01:04:56.040" style="s2">know you were asking me earlier what</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.150" end="01:04:57.690" style="s2">languages I speak and I&#39;d said English</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.040" end="01:04:58.920" style="s2">and you said he didn&#39;t learn in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.690" end="01:05:00.270" style="s2">Arabic and I said well I learned enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.920" end="01:05:03.450" style="s2">to say get down</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.270" end="01:05:06.090" style="s2">show me your hands but but wait when I</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.450" end="01:05:07.440" style="s2">would speak those words in Arabic to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.090" end="01:05:09.570" style="s2">know if we enter a building in their</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:11.070" style="s2">home and there&#39;s you know a military-age</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.570" end="01:05:12.660" style="s2">male and I&#39;d be speaking to him in</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.070" end="01:05:14.220" style="s2">Arabic he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.660" end="01:05:16.620" style="s2">understand that I was even trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.220" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">speak Arabic a because my Arabic is bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.620" end="01:05:23.970" style="s2">and B because it&#39;s it&#39;s just he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:26.550" style="s2">expecting that and so they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.970" end="01:05:28.260" style="s2">don&#39;t respond very seldom would I have</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.550" end="01:05:29.700" style="s2">until we get them to calm down a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.260" end="01:05:31.230" style="s2">bit then I could maybe speak a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.700" end="01:05:33.390" style="s2">bit of Arabic to them but in that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.230" end="01:05:35.040" style="s2">initial moment of Terror there&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.390" end="01:05:36.690" style="s2">don&#39;t understand they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.040" end="01:05:40.110" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.690" end="01:05:43.380" style="s2">not ready to hear it but when you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.110" end="01:05:46.070" style="s2">somebody that is resistant clearly</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.380" end="01:05:48.570" style="s2">resistant they&#39;re though there is some</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.070" end="01:05:50.910" style="s2">nonverbal communication that you can do</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.570" end="01:05:52.350" style="s2">that is violence and they will</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.910" end="01:05:54.510" style="s2">understand it and the other people that</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.350" end="01:05:57.510" style="s2">see it will understand it so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.510" end="01:05:59.730" style="s2">doubt that violence is a method of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.510" end="01:06:02.750" style="s2">communicating with people a message</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.730" end="01:06:05.550" style="s2">stronger than words in many cases and</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.750" end="01:06:07.890" style="s2">people like Saddam people like Isis</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.550" end="01:06:09.119" style="s2">they&#39;ll absolutely use that to the best</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.890" end="01:06:10.890" style="s2">of their ability and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.119" end="01:06:13.640" style="s2">exploit when things happen you know one</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.890" end="01:06:16.589" style="s2">of the one of the horrible strategic</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.640" end="01:06:21.059" style="s2">losses or strategic setbacks we had and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.589" end="01:06:23.910" style="s2">in the Iraq war was the the abuses that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.059" end="01:06:25.349" style="s2">went on at the Abu Ghraib prison because</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.910" end="01:06:28.289" style="s2">now we had photographs of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.349" end="01:06:30.900" style="s2">Americans with doing things that look</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.289" end="01:06:34.140" style="s2">like extreme torture to the prisoners</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.900" end="01:06:37.140" style="s2">there and and the al-qaeda elements just</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.140" end="01:06:39.329" style="s2">absolutely took those and ran with them</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.140" end="01:06:40.680" style="s2">to make to fuel that insurgency and it</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.329" end="01:06:43.380" style="s2">did it did a great job of fueling that</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.680" end="01:06:46.289" style="s2">insurgency so you have to be very very</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.380" end="01:06:48.569" style="s2">careful about the way you treat your</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.289" end="01:06:51.150" style="s2">enemy because if you treat if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.569" end="01:06:52.799" style="s2">mistreat the enemy then the enemy will</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.150" end="01:06:54.420" style="s2">use that as propaganda and they would do</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:06:56.279" style="s2">that on purpose they they would love</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.420" end="01:06:59.490" style="s2">nothing more for them than for you to</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.279" end="01:07:01.289" style="s2">accidentally kill a kid or you know drop</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.490" end="01:07:03.150" style="s2">a bomb on a mosque or drop a bomb they</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.289" end="01:07:06.119" style="s2">love they absolutely would love that and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.150" end="01:07:07.470" style="s2">so we had to do everything in our power</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.119" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">to prevent those things from happening</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.470" end="01:07:11.460" style="s2">because the strategic the negative</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:13.799" style="s2">strategic impact was phenomenal when</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.460" end="01:07:15.660" style="s2">events like that occur did you watch the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.799" end="01:07:18.930" style="s2">video of the Jordanian pilot who was</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.660" end="01:07:20.940" style="s2">executed by Isis yes yeah so a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.930" end="01:07:23.450" style="s2">people stateside did not watch that</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.940" end="01:07:27.630" style="s2">video and one of the things that I found</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.450" end="01:07:31.710" style="s2">very interesting about it was that it</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.630" end="01:07:33.809" style="s2">had a point that was disguised by our</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.710" end="01:07:35.670" style="s2">unwillingness to watch the video now</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.809" end="01:07:37.950" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s important that Isis not be</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.670" end="01:07:41.059" style="s2">allowed to communicate its point but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.950" end="01:07:44.009" style="s2">point was you&#39;re up there in the skies</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.059" end="01:07:46.739" style="s2">meeting out very particular forms of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.009" end="01:07:50.609" style="s2">death in particular incinerating people</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.739" end="01:07:53.160" style="s2">and burying them in rubble and our aim</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.609" end="01:07:56.009" style="s2">in this video is to subject a captured</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.160" end="01:07:59.279" style="s2">pilot to the exact form of death that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.009" end="01:08:01.499" style="s2">you are dispensing from the skies and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.279" end="01:08:04.170" style="s2">you&#39;re normally not here to see this let</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.499" end="01:08:08.279" style="s2">this be your death and you know it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.170" end="01:08:12.599" style="s2">cinematically beyond belief it was shot</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.279" end="01:08:16.139" style="s2">to be gorgeous and to be repugnant and</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.599" end="01:08:18.929" style="s2">sickening and that concept of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.139" end="01:08:20.639" style="s2">Hollywood style death filmed for real a</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.929" end="01:08:24.389" style="s2">snuff film if you will</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.639" end="01:08:26.940" style="s2">with a point and then offering bounties</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.389" end="01:08:29.850" style="s2">showing the homes of the Jordanian</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.940" end="01:08:33.569" style="s2">pilots you know by Street I think in</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.850" end="01:08:35.670" style="s2">Amman Jordan my sense was is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.569" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">Americans didn&#39;t pick up anything of</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.670" end="01:08:41.069" style="s2">what was going on because we decided</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:44.850" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t want our population</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.069" end="01:08:46.319" style="s2">exposed to anything coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.850" end="01:08:47.940" style="s2">other side even their propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.319" end="01:08:50.639" style="s2">informed us as to how they were thinking</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.940" end="01:08:53.130" style="s2">and feeling but it was as if we plugged</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.639" end="01:08:55.589" style="s2">our ears and didn&#39;t want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.130" end="01:08:59.880" style="s2">what we were watching do you do you see</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.589" end="01:09:04.500" style="s2">that I I see yeah I would agree with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.880" end="01:09:09.869" style="s2">point that when you disconnect people</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.500" end="01:09:12.900" style="s2">from war its they lose track right I</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.869" end="01:09:15.119" style="s2">mean in America you know we we when I</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.900" end="01:09:16.980" style="s2">was in Ramadi in 2006 I was you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.119" end="01:09:17.819" style="s2">sitting in some combat outposts in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.980" end="01:09:19.619" style="s2">middle of nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.819" end="01:09:22.290" style="s2">with mortar shells coming in and</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.619" end="01:09:25.589" style="s2">meanwhile everyone in America was you</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.290" end="01:09:27.509" style="s2">know going to the mall and driving</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.589" end="01:09:29.429" style="s2">around their SUV in order in a Starbucks</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.509" end="01:09:30.449" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s just the way it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.429" end="01:09:32.699" style="s2">I&#39;m not mad at that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.449" end="01:09:34.949" style="s2">but there&#39;s a definite detachment that</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.699" end="01:09:37.469" style="s2">I&#39;m mad at then no here&#39;s no here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.949" end="01:09:39.839" style="s2">I&#39;m mad at that first of all I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.469" end="01:09:41.580" style="s2">slightly older than you are</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.839" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">and so I have some memories of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.580" end="01:09:45.900" style="s2">Vietnam War as it was playing out on</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:51.000" style="s2">American television that some of my</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.900" end="01:09:54.299" style="s2">earliest childhood memories and let me</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.000" end="01:09:57.150" style="s2">say this it was spectacularly gruesome</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.299" end="01:10:00.600" style="s2">what we saw on the TV during that period</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.150" end="01:10:06.030" style="s2">of time I believe that my parents turned</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.600" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">off the TV when it showed an image of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.030" end="01:10:13.170" style="s2">gi&#39;s head on a pike and it was just like</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:15.179" style="s2">okay this is too much and on the one</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.170" end="01:10:18.119" style="s2">hand this was real information coming</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.179" end="01:10:19.380" style="s2">from the war and on the other hand it</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.119" end="01:10:21.239" style="s2">was propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.380" end="01:10:25.739" style="s2">it was meant to strike fear in our</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.239" end="01:10:28.889" style="s2">hearts there was a self-hatred that was</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.739" end="01:10:32.159" style="s2">playing out just as there was concern</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.889" end="01:10:34.020" style="s2">about the excesses of American kids</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.159" end="01:10:36.000" style="s2">being turned loose in a jungle with</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.020" end="01:10:37.860" style="s2">too little discipline and supervision I</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.000" end="01:10:43.340" style="s2">mean there was so much happening in</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.860" end="01:10:46.200" style="s2">Vietnam which was hard to pull apart and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.340" end="01:10:49.320" style="s2">what I found was is that after that war</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.200" end="01:10:52.290" style="s2">we never went into a conflict the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.320" end="01:10:55.770" style="s2">way again the embedded journalists</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.290" end="01:10:57.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to want to report in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.770" end="01:11:00.360" style="s2">same way that a non embedded journalist</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.960" end="01:11:04.140" style="s2">did and there&#39;s a need that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.360" end="01:11:05.850" style="s2">be able to go to war without constantly</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.140" end="01:11:09.300" style="s2">second-guessing ourselves and putting</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.850" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">our own troops in harm&#39;s way and not</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.300" end="01:11:14.850" style="s2">working through all of our psychological</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">nonsense when we have people who are you</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.850" end="01:11:20.850" style="s2">know definitely at risk and doing our</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:22.920" style="s2">work as the military I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.850" end="01:11:26.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever really come to grips with the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.920" end="01:11:28.620" style="s2">lessons of Vietnam we we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.550" end="01:11:31.290" style="s2">clear sense that we should go to war as</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.620" end="01:11:33.930" style="s2">a nation where the newsreels should talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.290" end="01:11:36.870" style="s2">about our side versus the other side we</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.930" end="01:11:39.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do this do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.870" end="01:11:42.120" style="s2">sense that I got my sense is is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.960" end="01:11:51.870" style="s2">Vietnam really broke something in terms</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.120" end="01:11:54.630" style="s2">of our ability to go to war Vietnam was</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.870" end="01:11:58.290" style="s2">we have been lucky enough to have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.630" end="01:12:00.810" style="s2">of podcast guests that were in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.290" end="01:12:03.630" style="s2">and their experiences were all different</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.810" end="01:12:06.239" style="s2">I mean from one guy captain Charlie plum</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.630" end="01:12:09.930" style="s2">who was shot down and was in the Hanoi</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.239" end="01:12:13.290" style="s2">Hilton for six years I&#39;ve had SOG</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.930" end="01:12:14.550" style="s2">operators special operation or Studies</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.290" end="01:12:16.560" style="s2">and observation group guys that were</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.550" end="01:12:19.080" style="s2">fighting behind the lines in Cambodia</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.560" end="01:12:21.239" style="s2">and Laos I&#39;ve had helicopter pilot that</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.080" end="01:12:24.630" style="s2">was shot down and in the jungle prisoner</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.239" end="01:12:27.810" style="s2">prisons for months and months being</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.630" end="01:12:32.969" style="s2">tortured and and mock executed the whole</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.810" end="01:12:34.380" style="s2">nine yards so what was what was horrible</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.969" end="01:12:37.020" style="s2">there&#39;s so many horrible things about</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.380" end="01:12:39.840" style="s2">Vietnam you know I did I did a podcast</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.020" end="01:12:42.660" style="s2">about the meal I massacre which which</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.840" end="01:12:45.580" style="s2">really is by far the most the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.660" end="01:12:47.740" style="s2">atrocity that American troops have</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.580" end="01:12:49.720" style="s2">ever comitted and it was absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.740" end="01:12:51.850" style="s2">heinous now you could go to Sand Creek</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.720" end="01:12:53.710" style="s2">and maybe some of the Native Americans</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.850" end="01:12:57.340" style="s2">there were some some significant</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.710" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">horrible atrocities there as well those</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.340" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">generally weren&#39;t as clear-cut you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:06.280" style="s2">most of those had American soldiers that</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:08.500" style="s2">were saying no stop right Nilay for a</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.280" end="01:13:10.600" style="s2">while for for at least several hours it</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.500" end="01:13:14.110" style="s2">was no no one when no one was stopping</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.600" end="01:13:15.970" style="s2">so what you had you know what you have I</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.110" end="01:13:17.860" style="s2">think what with the press and the media</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.970" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">and Vietnam was you got a lens into what</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.860" end="01:13:24.010" style="s2">war is and in war you&#39;re killing other</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.760" end="01:13:26.980" style="s2">people right and when you&#39;re killing</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.010" end="01:13:29.260" style="s2">other people it&#39;s you know you you just</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.980" end="01:13:31.480" style="s2">take one step back if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.260" end="01:13:33.100" style="s2">what that other person did and you take</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.480" end="01:13:35.170" style="s2">one step back and you watch someone kill</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.100" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">someone else that is that is not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.170" end="01:13:38.590" style="s2">go over well in most people&#39;s stomachs</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:39.910" style="s2">most people are gonna look at that and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.590" end="01:13:42.370" style="s2">say why is this happening why are we</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.910" end="01:13:44.740" style="s2">doing this so that&#39;s what happened in</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.370" end="01:13:47.410" style="s2">Vietnam you take one step back and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.740" end="01:13:49.390" style="s2">see you take one step back and what you</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.410" end="01:13:51.250" style="s2">see is killing you see human beings</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.390" end="01:13:54.340" style="s2">killing other human beings and why in</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.250" end="01:13:56.200" style="s2">god&#39;s name are we doing this and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.340" end="01:14:01.870" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think happened in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.200" end="01:14:04.300" style="s2">how it broke us I mean I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.870" end="01:14:06.850" style="s2">broke us is the right word but we</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.300" end="01:14:09.070" style="s2">certainly are more cautious and should</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.850" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">be more cautious always about going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.070" end="01:14:13.270" style="s2">war I mean you know you you want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:14.470" style="s2">to the people that don&#39;t want to go to</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.270" end="01:14:15.970" style="s2">war it&#39;s the people that have been to</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.470" end="01:14:18.250" style="s2">war the people that have had their</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.970" end="01:14:20.200" style="s2">friends get killed like they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.250" end="01:14:22.270" style="s2">that don&#39;t want to go to war unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.200" end="01:14:24.520" style="s2">absolutely necessary unless we&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.270" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">every other method unless we&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.520" end="01:14:29.380" style="s2">every other technique that we could use</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:31.420" style="s2">to prevent us from going to war now that</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.380" end="01:14:34.780" style="s2">when you have to go to war like go to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.420" end="01:14:36.010" style="s2">war and win that&#39;s that&#39;s my attitude we</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.780" end="01:14:38.170" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go to war at all if we</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.010" end="01:14:40.420" style="s2">have to go go and win win as quickly as</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.170" end="01:14:42.790" style="s2">you can we&#39;ll just use whatever means</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.420" end="01:14:44.110" style="s2">necessary to achieve a quick dominant</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.790" end="01:14:48.070" style="s2">victory</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.110" end="01:14:50.079" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s so much and that&#39;s so so</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.070" end="01:14:54.190" style="s2">rich is an answer I guess where I want</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.079" end="01:14:56.849" style="s2">to go back to is I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.190" end="01:15:00.040" style="s2">irresponsible for us as a nation to</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.849" end="01:15:05.530" style="s2">allow this much insulation of the home</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.040" end="01:15:09.070" style="s2">front from the raw facts of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.530" end="01:15:11.860" style="s2">doing abroad and that if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.070" end="01:15:13.989" style="s2">mean you know if you take my assessment</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.860" end="01:15:16.949" style="s2">that the United States is the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.989" end="01:15:20.980" style="s2">dangerous machine ever constructed right</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.949" end="01:15:23.409" style="s2">we do not have the right to wield that</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.980" end="01:15:26.440" style="s2">power if we&#39;re not interested in what it</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.409" end="01:15:29.050" style="s2">looks like and what it means if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.440" end="01:15:31.179" style="s2">not willing to celebrate heroes who come</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.050" end="01:15:34.420" style="s2">back from the battlefield if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.179" end="01:15:36.579" style="s2">willing to look at murderers and</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.420" end="01:15:39.369" style="s2">Psychopaths who fought under our flag I</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.579" end="01:15:41.170" style="s2">mean you know my belief is is that you</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.369" end="01:15:44.110" style="s2">to have a mature relationship with your</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.170" end="01:15:46.599" style="s2">country requires being able to look at</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.110" end="01:15:49.960" style="s2">something like me lie and seeing it for</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.599" end="01:15:51.610" style="s2">the horror that it was and still coming</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.960" end="01:15:53.530" style="s2">to an understanding that there is going</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.610" end="01:15:55.420" style="s2">to be some amount of breakdown that</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.530" end="01:15:58.119" style="s2">looks something like that maybe not that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.420" end="01:16:00.190" style="s2">bad anytime we deploy troops that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.119" end="01:16:03.849" style="s2">part of what it means to deploy troops</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.190" end="01:16:06.429" style="s2">is is that you can&#39;t monitor how every</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.849" end="01:16:08.440" style="s2">particular unit functions and</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.429" end="01:16:11.500" style="s2">particularly if there are no eyes on</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.440" end="01:16:14.710" style="s2">them one of the things that I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.500" end="01:16:16.270" style="s2">before is that if you go to war you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.710" end="01:16:19.599" style="s2">to be willing you have to have the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.270" end="01:16:21.760" style="s2">will the will for the following two</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.599" end="01:16:24.610" style="s2">things to happen number one is you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.760" end="01:16:26.440" style="s2">to have the will to kill and when I say</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.610" end="01:16:28.540" style="s2">kill I&#39;m not just talking about killing</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.440" end="01:16:30.520" style="s2">your enemy because although you&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.540" end="01:16:32.770" style="s2">and kill your enemy you will absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.520" end="01:16:35.559" style="s2">have collateral damage in war and</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.770" end="01:16:37.210" style="s2">innocent people are going to die and if</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.559" end="01:16:39.340" style="s2">you think that you can pull off a war</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.210" end="01:16:41.829" style="s2">without killing innocent people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.340" end="01:16:42.820" style="s2">wrong so you have to be willing to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.829" end="01:16:45.790" style="s2">that you have to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.820" end="01:16:47.290" style="s2">cause the reason that the why behind why</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.790" end="01:16:48.969" style="s2">you&#39;re going to war you need to make</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.290" end="01:16:51.340" style="s2">sure that you understand that you will</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.969" end="01:16:53.079" style="s2">kill innocent people and you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:54.790" style="s2">willing to do that even if you net save</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.079" end="01:16:56.300" style="s2">innocent lives there will always be</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.790" end="01:16:58.520" style="s2">innocent casual</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.300" end="01:17:00.050" style="s2">will absolutely be innocent casualties</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.520" end="01:17:01.670" style="s2">and the other will that you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.050" end="01:17:04.130" style="s2">is you have to have the will to die and</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.670" end="01:17:05.960" style="s2">that is that no matter how surgical you</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.130" end="01:17:07.190" style="s2">are no matter how good your weapons are</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.960" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">know how matter matter how good your</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.190" end="01:17:13.730" style="s2">technology is when you go to war you</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:16.849" style="s2">will have young American men and women</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.730" end="01:17:19.880" style="s2">being killed in horrible ways way too</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.849" end="01:17:21.619" style="s2">young over and over and over again and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.880" end="01:17:24.500" style="s2">if you&#39;re not ready for those two things</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.619" end="01:17:29.030" style="s2">then you need to stop and think about</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.500" end="01:17:31.849" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually doing yeah what do</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.030" end="01:17:35.929" style="s2">we do about changing the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.849" end="01:17:40.040" style="s2">between news media and combat troops so</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.929" end="01:17:42.230" style="s2">that we have the ability to understand</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.040" end="01:17:44.630" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing abroad say thank you to</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.230" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">the people who need to be thanked and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.630" end="01:17:50.119" style="s2">welcomed home keep an eye on what needs</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:54.040" style="s2">to not happen such as a place like Abu</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.119" end="01:17:57.469" style="s2">Ghraib it seems to me that we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.040" end="01:18:00.730" style="s2">we&#39;re developing a fragility as a people</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.469" end="01:18:04.369" style="s2">that is incompatible with our level of</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.730" end="01:18:06.260" style="s2">lethality and we have to get information</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.369" end="01:18:08.840" style="s2">back to the homefront am I wrong in this</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.260" end="01:18:11.300" style="s2">I mean we had embedded troops in Ramadi</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.840" end="01:18:13.670" style="s2">there was combat photographers there was</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.300" end="01:18:15.860" style="s2">photographers there was reporters they</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.670" end="01:18:21.559" style="s2">had very open access to everything that</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.860" end="01:18:24.559" style="s2">was going on so I think I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.559" end="01:18:27.380" style="s2">many clicks on the websites the normal</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.559" end="01:18:29.150" style="s2">military news stories got compared to</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.380" end="01:18:33.800" style="s2">you know whatever entertainment</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.150" end="01:18:35.449" style="s2">Hollywood Brian gets well so let me give</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.800" end="01:18:38.179" style="s2">you an example of what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.449" end="01:18:41.659" style="s2">this isn&#39;t strictly a foreign foreign</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.179" end="01:18:44.329" style="s2">involvement but when 9/11 happened the</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.659" end="01:18:46.280" style="s2">most famous photograph from 9/11 is this</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.329" end="01:18:48.520" style="s2">photograph called falling man of this</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.280" end="01:18:51.139" style="s2">inverted human being sort of doing a</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.520" end="01:18:54.290" style="s2">weird kind of like bicycle motion and</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.139" end="01:18:57.230" style="s2">he&#39;s falling to his death and I think it</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.290" end="01:19:00.650" style="s2">ran once briefly in the morning it was</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.230" end="01:19:03.500" style="s2">spiked and it didn&#39;t become the iconic</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.650" end="01:19:05.750" style="s2">photograph of 9/11 if I think back to</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.500" end="01:19:08.719" style="s2">Vietnam we all have the same set of 10</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.750" end="01:19:10.699" style="s2">photographs seared into our minds and</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.719" end="01:19:13.429" style="s2">yet I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.699" end="01:19:16.810" style="s2">you know beyond like a statue being</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.429" end="01:19:19.340" style="s2">toppled what we would associate with</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.810" end="01:19:21.890" style="s2">Iraq except for the Abu Ghraib</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.340" end="01:19:27.250" style="s2">photographs so it didn&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.890" end="01:19:30.350" style="s2">that kind of effect of in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.250" end="01:19:32.150" style="s2">commemorat commemorative what that war</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.350" end="01:19:33.890" style="s2">looked like how long were we there how</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.150" end="01:19:37.880" style="s2">many troops did we have how many</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.890" end="01:19:40.760" style="s2">families you know lost somebody I just I</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.880" end="01:19:43.460" style="s2">feel I feel like it sort of took place</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.760" end="01:19:46.340" style="s2">out of sight yeah and the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.460" end="01:19:48.530" style="s2">thing is there&#39;s thousands and thousands</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.340" end="01:19:50.150" style="s2">and thousands of pictures I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.530" end="01:19:52.580" style="s2">think they were I don&#39;t think I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.150" end="01:19:53.989" style="s2">more I think the prop the I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.580" end="01:19:55.040" style="s2">if we call a problem but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.989" end="01:19:56.270" style="s2">more the fact that people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.040" end="01:19:58.160" style="s2">clicking on those pictures and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.270" end="01:20:02.090" style="s2">remembering them because if you google</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.160" end="01:20:04.340" style="s2">Iraq war you&#39;ll see hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.090" end="01:20:06.140" style="s2">thousands of pictures from all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.340" end="01:20:09.260" style="s2">news agencies all over the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.140" end="01:20:11.630" style="s2">just people maybe they&#39;ve seen so many</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.260" end="01:20:14.300" style="s2">pictures that they&#39;re over it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.630" end="01:20:16.640" style="s2">believe this actually deco here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.300" end="01:20:18.290" style="s2">my take on it if you think about what</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.640" end="01:20:21.650" style="s2">the cartels have been doing on our</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.290" end="01:20:24.890" style="s2">southern border it is spectacular the</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.650" end="01:20:28.880" style="s2">violence is so graphic and so disturbing</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.890" end="01:20:32.600" style="s2">by design and yet so many Americans are</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:35.929" style="s2">unaware of just how bad that the drug</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.600" end="01:20:37.640" style="s2">wars have been in Mexico because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.929" end="01:20:40.250" style="s2">information doesn&#39;t percolate and these</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.640" end="01:20:42.410" style="s2">photographs if they were run would</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.250" end="01:20:44.750" style="s2">capture the public&#39;s imagination I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.410" end="01:20:45.920" style="s2">think there&#39;s any question okay I see</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.750" end="01:20:47.510" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying now I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.920" end="01:20:50.030" style="s2">quite understand that it makes good</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.510" end="01:20:50.840" style="s2">sense with the cartel because certainly</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.030" end="01:20:53.000" style="s2">they&#39;re down there</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.840" end="01:20:55.640" style="s2">I think we&#39;re terrified to show people</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.000" end="01:20:56.570" style="s2">the extremes of what life actually looks</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.640" end="01:21:00.080" style="s2">like anymore</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.570" end="01:21:01.880" style="s2">yes and if that is a bad thing you all</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.080" end="01:21:03.650" style="s2">right that is a bad you are correct</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.880" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">it&#39;s taken me a while to understand your</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.650" end="01:21:09.530" style="s2">point I apologize no no no you you are</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:12.890" style="s2">correct and and you should people should</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.530" end="01:21:15.650" style="s2">see what you know I I would when I would</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.890" end="01:21:18.140" style="s2">talk to young seals even now I have</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.650" end="01:21:19.550" style="s2">pictures of of me like color photographs</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.140" end="01:21:21.280" style="s2">of me lie which you know you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.550" end="01:21:23.230" style="s2">very many of those but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.280" end="01:21:25.780" style="s2">absolutely horrible</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.230" end="01:21:28.210" style="s2">look at even for a even for a young seal</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.780" end="01:21:30.610" style="s2">that&#39;s you know in his mind super hungry</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.210" end="01:21:32.830" style="s2">for combat they see these pictures that</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.610" end="01:21:34.360" style="s2">I put up on on the big screen for them</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.830" end="01:21:36.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s did stomach-turning</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.360" end="01:21:39.820" style="s2">then so that&#39;s what they need to see</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:41.800" style="s2">they need to understand that you go a</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.820" end="01:21:43.570" style="s2">little bit off the wrong direction if</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.800" end="01:21:45.190" style="s2">somebody doesn&#39;t step up and say no when</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.570" end="01:21:48.580" style="s2">things start to go sideways this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.190" end="01:21:50.830" style="s2">where it can end up that&#39;s right so yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.580" end="01:21:52.600" style="s2">what you are saying is correct if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.830" end="01:21:54.520" style="s2">want people to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.600" end="01:21:56.890" style="s2">happening one of the best ways to do it</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.520" end="01:21:59.590" style="s2">is the same technique that you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.890" end="01:22:02.260" style="s2">earlier that the enemy can use which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.590" end="01:22:04.840" style="s2">a message of violence here&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.260" end="01:22:07.750" style="s2">happening on the southern border these</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.840" end="01:22:10.150" style="s2">are the people that are one mile away</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.750" end="01:22:12.820" style="s2">and this is what they&#39;re doing to whole</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.150" end="01:22:15.850" style="s2">families in certain cases yes should</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.820" end="01:22:16.989" style="s2">that be propagated absolutely so that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.850" end="01:22:18.010" style="s2">understand the seriousness of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.989" end="01:22:20.980" style="s2">situation down there</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.010" end="01:22:24.010" style="s2">same thing with when Isis was acting</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.980" end="01:22:25.180" style="s2">this way anybody that looks I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.010" end="01:22:28.620" style="s2">know here&#39;s another good case was the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.180" end="01:22:33.130" style="s2">Rwandan genocide right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.620" end="01:22:38.590" style="s2">800,000 people in a hundred days mostly</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.130" end="01:22:39.940" style="s2">with machetes and what we I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.590" end="01:22:43.239" style="s2">to say we let that happen</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.940" end="01:22:46.390" style="s2">but we could have intervened in in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.239" end="01:22:47.710" style="s2">very powerful way and and we we chose</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.390" end="01:22:49.510" style="s2">not to and part of the reason that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.710" end="01:22:52.239" style="s2">chose not to is because of the very</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.510" end="01:22:54.489" style="s2">graphic images you&#39;re talking about from</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.239" end="01:22:56.050" style="s2">a year and a half earlier when Somalia</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.489" end="01:22:58.270" style="s2">took place and they were dragging</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.050" end="01:23:00.850" style="s2">American soldiers bodies through the</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.270" end="01:23:02.560" style="s2">streets and and and we got we got</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.850" end="01:23:03.880" style="s2">completely turned off by that and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.560" end="01:23:05.020" style="s2">when Rwanda happened it&#39;s like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.880" end="01:23:07.210" style="s2">want it we don&#39;t know if we want to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.020" end="01:23:10.360" style="s2">this is really what offends me which is</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.210" end="01:23:12.550" style="s2">that like when you send somebody into a</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.360" end="01:23:14.050" style="s2">position where they could have their</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.550" end="01:23:17.260" style="s2">body dragged through the streets by</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.050" end="01:23:20.470" style="s2">enemy combatants and they know that and</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.260" end="01:23:22.300" style="s2">you turn away because like you sent them</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.470" end="01:23:24.690" style="s2">there and then you can&#39;t bear to look</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.300" end="01:23:28.180" style="s2">because of your delicate sensibilities</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.690" end="01:23:31.600" style="s2">that strikes me is something very very</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.180" end="01:23:34.540" style="s2">wrong as opposed to we know why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.600" end="01:23:35.880" style="s2">some place and thank God we have people</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.540" end="01:23:38.820" style="s2">who were willing to</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.880" end="01:23:40.740" style="s2">do this and you know I mean I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.820" end="01:23:42.360" style="s2">that the depth and the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.740" end="01:23:43.980" style="s2">your perspective you&#39;re saying on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.360" end="01:23:45.840" style="s2">one hand people who&#39;ve been to war the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.980" end="01:23:47.820" style="s2">ones who don&#39;t want to go us to go to</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.840" end="01:23:50.970" style="s2">war on the other hand you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.820" end="01:23:52.410" style="s2">war can be more fun and more meaning</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.970" end="01:23:55.020" style="s2">than you could have in the rest of your</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.410" end="01:23:57.120" style="s2">life and these are these are really not</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.020" end="01:24:00.300" style="s2">contradictions but they&#39;re incredible</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.120" end="01:24:02.820" style="s2">tensions and instead of having this be</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.300" end="01:24:06.300" style="s2">part of our makeup where people come</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.820" end="01:24:08.310" style="s2">back from the front and they talk maybe</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.300" end="01:24:10.620" style="s2">in measured ways about what they saw</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.310" end="01:24:13.740" style="s2">what they participated in and what they</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.620" end="01:24:15.030" style="s2">saw this is doing for our nation I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.740" end="01:24:17.520" style="s2">I think that these things are very</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.030" end="01:24:20.790" style="s2">progressive in a certain sense that</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.520" end="01:24:22.950" style="s2">we&#39;re standing up for people who you</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.790" end="01:24:24.960" style="s2">know might be completely defenseless</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.950" end="01:24:27.450" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about in Ramadi and</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.960" end="01:24:30.600" style="s2">in fact I&#39;m very worried that what you</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.450" end="01:24:31.950" style="s2">said was that in Ramadi the people who</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.600" end="01:24:34.290" style="s2">got killed were the people who had</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.950" end="01:24:37.080" style="s2">helped our coalition and so did we have</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.290" end="01:24:39.540" style="s2">an obligation to stay there in order to</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.080" end="01:24:41.760" style="s2">make sure that the people who helped us</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.540" end="01:24:43.860" style="s2">weren&#39;t in harm&#39;s way we saw the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.760" end="01:24:47.870" style="s2">thing with the Marsh Arabs in the south</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.860" end="01:24:50.610" style="s2">of Iraq where they were told to rise up</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.870" end="01:24:52.470" style="s2">by a former president and we saw the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.610" end="01:24:56.190" style="s2">same thing in Vietnam we saw the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.470" end="01:24:59.520" style="s2">thing in Vietnam I mean it matters to me</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.190" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re engaged enough to realize hey</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.520" end="01:25:04.680" style="s2">we just issued an instruction and people</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:07.320" style="s2">trusted us and now those people are in a</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.680" end="01:25:11.030" style="s2">world of pain and hurt and where are we</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.320" end="01:25:16.830" style="s2">and we have to we need a tougher country</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.030" end="01:25:19.440" style="s2">there was it was it was sickening for me</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.830" end="01:25:21.660" style="s2">when I when I saw the flag the black</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.440" end="01:25:22.230" style="s2">flag of Isis flying over the city of</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.660" end="01:25:25.410" style="s2">Ramadi</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.230" end="01:25:27.990" style="s2">I mean clearly first and foremost</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.410" end="01:25:29.970" style="s2">because of my own friends and my men</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.990" end="01:25:32.330" style="s2">that were killed in that battle and and</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.970" end="01:25:35.490" style="s2">wounded in that battle then obviously</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.330" end="01:25:37.470" style="s2">the Marines the soldiers the sailors the</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.490" end="01:25:40.590" style="s2">airmen that that fought alongside of us</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.470" end="01:25:44.040" style="s2">who made the same sacrifices were killed</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.590" end="01:25:45.510" style="s2">or gravely wounded and then I knew you</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.040" end="01:25:47.370" style="s2">know as soon as we as soon as I saw that</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.510" end="01:25:48.210" style="s2">that flag flying I mean before we even</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.370" end="01:25:50.880" style="s2">got reports</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.210" end="01:25:53.100" style="s2">ak we knew what was gonna happen to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.880" end="01:25:56.400" style="s2">civilian populace the civilian populace</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.100" end="01:25:57.630" style="s2">had been was going to be it was going to</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.400" end="01:25:59.790" style="s2">be annihilated</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.630" end="01:26:01.350" style="s2">and that that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.790" end="01:26:03.660" style="s2">and they do it at the level of families</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.350" end="01:26:07.350" style="s2">right yes somebody collaborated entire</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.660" end="01:26:09.239" style="s2">family the family is done right so did</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.350" end="01:26:10.590" style="s2">we have an obligation in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.239" end="01:26:13.650" style="s2">which again this is just one man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.590" end="01:26:15.300" style="s2">opinion yeah in my opinion absolutely we</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.650" end="01:26:18.950" style="s2">absolutely had an obligation to led to</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.300" end="01:26:22.860" style="s2">hear that and the the fact that that we</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.950" end="01:26:26.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t uphold that obligation it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.860" end="01:26:28.860" style="s2">not good it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a letdown</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.100" end="01:26:30.030" style="s2">it&#39;s and luckily we went back and they</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.860" end="01:26:32.010" style="s2">were able to take back the city and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.030" end="01:26:34.440" style="s2">Americans did support that and but the</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.010" end="01:26:36.330" style="s2">Iraqis they did the bolt they did the</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.440" end="01:26:38.400" style="s2">fighting which was very impressive</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.330" end="01:26:40.410" style="s2">because when we were in Ramadi in 2006</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.400" end="01:26:42.150" style="s2">the Iraqis didn&#39;t didn&#39;t want they</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.410" end="01:26:44.219" style="s2">didn&#39;t really have the stomach for the</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.150" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">fight but I have friends that were in</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.219" end="01:26:49.260" style="s2">Mosul and the Iraqi troops were fighting</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:51.600" style="s2">hard they were taking massive casualties</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.260" end="01:26:52.350" style="s2">in fact the Americans were saying look I</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.600" end="01:26:54.930" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we&#39;re gonna have enough</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.350" end="01:26:57.120" style="s2">Iraqis to do this and but the Iraqis</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.930" end="01:26:59.790" style="s2">kept fighting so so that was a really</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.120" end="01:27:03.150" style="s2">positive thing to see that the Iraqis</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.790" end="01:27:05.130" style="s2">were now fighting for themselves but do</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.150" end="01:27:08.550" style="s2">we have a moral obligation I think once</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.130" end="01:27:10.200" style="s2">we commit to something like that then we</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.550" end="01:27:11.340" style="s2">need to see it through and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.200" end="01:27:14.820" style="s2">certain amount of you break it you</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.340" end="01:27:18.030" style="s2">bought it especially because you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.820" end="01:27:21.900" style="s2">Lafe who who wrote the books with me he</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.030" end="01:27:24.300" style="s2">went back to Ramadi in 2010 and during</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.900" end="01:27:27.989" style="s2">so when we were there together there was</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.300" end="01:27:30.270" style="s2">you know there beat 1 2 3 4 or 5</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.989" end="01:27:32.400" style="s2">casualties a day right several of those</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.270" end="01:27:33.600" style="s2">wounded son was killed every single day</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.400" end="01:27:36.719" style="s2">just in the city of Ramadi</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.600" end="01:27:39.120" style="s2">when Lafe went back in 2010 during his</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.719" end="01:27:42.300" style="s2">entire six-month deployment there was a</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.120" end="01:27:44.040" style="s2">one fatality one coalition fatality it</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.300" end="01:27:47.150" style="s2">was from a vehicle rollover it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.040" end="01:27:50.640" style="s2">combat incident so it was completely</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.150" end="01:27:55.170" style="s2">decided down yeah it was it was peaceful</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.640" end="01:27:57.810" style="s2">and we took that as okay we should leave</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.170" end="01:27:58.920" style="s2">now and and that was the wrong move that</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.810" end="01:28:00.810" style="s2">was the wrong move and people say how</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.920" end="01:28:02.540" style="s2">long you gonna stay there let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.810" end="01:28:05.340" style="s2">we&#39;re still in Germany</p>

<p begin="01:28:05.340" end="01:28:12.840" style="s2">Japan even so I mean this is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.670" end="01:28:16.110" style="s2">where I want us to think about total</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.840" end="01:28:18.870" style="s2">cost of ownership of a conflict and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.110" end="01:28:22.800" style="s2">want whoever is going to lead us and is</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.870" end="01:28:25.290" style="s2">very concerned watching the Democrat I</p>

<p begin="01:28:31.830" end="01:28:38.550" style="s2">people came from a tougher perspective</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.130" end="01:28:42.150" style="s2">knowing that American troop deployment</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.550" end="01:28:43.890" style="s2">is a real issue and who are we going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.150" end="01:28:47.580" style="s2">follow do they have the presence of mind</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.890" end="01:28:50.010" style="s2">the gravitas to tell the country hey we</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.580" end="01:28:51.570" style="s2">are going to go into something and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.010" end="01:28:53.400" style="s2">guys need to toughen up because</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.570" end="01:28:56.790" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re going to be inconsistent</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.400" end="01:29:00.840" style="s2">sending messages to the people who are</p>

<p begin="01:29:10.230" end="01:29:14.460" style="s2">it&#39;s just irresponsible for us as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.640" end="01:29:15.480" style="s2">country to be this focused on on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.460" end="01:29:17.100" style="s2">going you know keeping up with the</p>

<p begin="01:29:34.290" end="01:29:39.960" style="s2">more willing to abandon those situations</p>

<p begin="01:29:47.000" end="01:29:52.140" style="s2">Americans should know and understand</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.530" end="01:29:54.510" style="s2">what is happening overseas so that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.140" end="01:29:57.000" style="s2">can make informed decisions back here</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.510" end="01:29:58.830" style="s2">and be able to stomach it and and have</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.000" end="01:30:01.140" style="s2">that will that I talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.830" end="01:30:04.950" style="s2">the will to kill and the will to die</p>

<p begin="01:36:47.760" end="01:36:52.989" style="s2">they take it and they do a better job</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.500" end="01:36:55.300" style="s2">and that was like the that was the very</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.989" end="01:36:57.850" style="s2">first kernel the very first seed in my</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.300" end="01:37:00.340" style="s2">brain about leadership seeing it from</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.850" end="01:37:04.690" style="s2">the perspective of oh if you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.340" end="01:37:06.160" style="s2">listen to people then then they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.690" end="01:37:07.750" style="s2">want to work for you more and this was</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.160" end="01:37:09.400" style="s2">contrasted with their the guy that got</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.750" end="01:37:11.380" style="s2">fired who didn&#39;t listen anyone well this</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.400" end="01:37:12.640" style="s2">is this is something I&#39;m glad you bring</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.380" end="01:37:14.880" style="s2">this up I don&#39;t know whether this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.640" end="01:37:17.170" style="s2">gonna dovetail properly but I always</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.880" end="01:37:19.930" style="s2">surprise people that I talk about</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.170" end="01:37:21.880" style="s2">followership because we always talk</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.930" end="01:37:23.440" style="s2">about leadership and I think we have a</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.880" end="01:37:25.570" style="s2">terrible relationship to it which is</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.440" end="01:37:27.520" style="s2">that leadership it&#39;s like yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.570" end="01:37:29.680" style="s2">kicking back I&#39;m in the corner office I</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.520" end="01:37:31.300" style="s2">got this thing and in fact I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.680" end="01:37:33.699" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing to do with leadership I</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.300" end="01:37:36.820" style="s2">think that leadership involves</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.699" end="01:37:38.680" style="s2">followership and the people who hate the</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.820" end="01:37:41.739" style="s2">idea of following other people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.680" end="01:37:44.230" style="s2">lead themselves and so when you find</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.739" end="01:37:45.520" style="s2">that people have a finally they&#39;ll smirk</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.230" end="01:37:48.100" style="s2">oh you&#39;re interested in followership</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.520" end="01:37:50.830" style="s2">greatest gift I can give many people is</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.100" end="01:37:52.690" style="s2">saying I&#39;ll take direction from you and</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.830" end="01:37:54.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very weird people think</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.690" end="01:37:55.540" style="s2">that they want to be in the top spot as</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.160" end="01:37:57.610" style="s2">soon as they have responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.540" end="01:38:00.130" style="s2">somebody somebody&#39;s sort of following</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.610" end="01:38:02.949" style="s2">their directions they&#39;re not sure that</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.130" end="01:38:05.260" style="s2">they love it yeah well just a dovetail</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.949" end="01:38:07.540" style="s2">into that now people are generally</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.260" end="01:38:09.730" style="s2">surprised when I build up and I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.540" end="01:38:11.440" style="s2">talking about build up the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.730" end="01:38:12.760" style="s2">leadership one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.440" end="01:38:14.380" style="s2">leadership tools that they have in their</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.760" end="01:38:16.780" style="s2">entire inventory of leadership tools</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.380" end="01:38:18.250" style="s2">that they can they can utilize and they</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.780" end="01:38:20.380" style="s2">can exploit and they could take</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.250" end="01:38:21.730" style="s2">advantage of this tool at the right time</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.380" end="01:38:25.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna do wonders for them is to</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.730" end="01:38:26.650" style="s2">listen to people right like just be</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.030" end="01:38:28.600" style="s2">quiet as a leader and just listen to</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.650" end="01:38:31.000" style="s2">what people are saying and if they have</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.600" end="01:38:32.739" style="s2">a good idea support their idea but you</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.000" end="01:38:34.810" style="s2">know there&#39;s a sort of a weird thing to</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.739" end="01:38:37.570" style="s2">bring up because it&#39;s not as intense as</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.810" end="01:38:39.550" style="s2">what you do but when I have when I work</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.570" end="01:38:42.070" style="s2">with an assistant one of the first</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.550" end="01:38:45.600" style="s2">things I do is to teach that person to</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.070" end="01:38:47.620" style="s2">tell me when I&#39;m over a line like</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.600" end="01:38:50.890" style="s2">because if that person doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.620" end="01:38:53.410" style="s2">comfort with saying hey you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.890" end="01:38:54.910" style="s2">calling me on a Sunday and this is not</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.410" end="01:38:56.949" style="s2">an appropriate reason the Communist I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.910" end="01:38:58.480" style="s2">they you&#39;re out of line then I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.949" end="01:39:00.670" style="s2">feel great because if I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.480" end="01:39:01.960" style="s2">leadership role with that person then I</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.670" end="01:39:03.619" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they&#39;re doing these things</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.960" end="01:39:05.869" style="s2">because they want to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.619" end="01:39:08.630" style="s2">thing is always like can I get you</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.869" end="01:39:11.659" style="s2">coffee and I want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.630" end="01:39:13.909" style="s2">somebody understands that if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.659" end="01:39:16.310" style="s2">forming hierarchy is it&#39;s not for the</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.909" end="01:39:18.020" style="s2">pleasure of working out you know love we</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.310" end="01:39:19.219" style="s2">didn&#39;t get as a child it&#39;s because we</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.020" end="01:39:22.790" style="s2">actually have to accomplish something</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.219" end="01:39:25.580" style="s2">and trying to take the sting out of it</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.790" end="01:39:29.719" style="s2">without taking you know in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.580" end="01:39:31.460" style="s2">the the necessity of forming hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.719" end="01:39:34.040" style="s2">because I think that most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.460" end="01:39:35.540" style="s2">have an idea that if people below you</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.040" end="01:39:37.610" style="s2">don&#39;t want to follow you there are a</p>

<p begin="01:41:02.030" end="01:41:05.510" style="s2">we have a plan that your team came up</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.650" end="01:41:08.000" style="s2">with you came up with and and now</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.510" end="01:41:10.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no talk of how do I get you to</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.000" end="01:41:12.290" style="s2">buy into my plan right you it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.550" end="01:41:13.429" style="s2">plan you&#39;re already bought in so is your</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.290" end="01:41:15.050" style="s2">whole team when you bring it back to me</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.429" end="01:41:16.989" style="s2">and you say hey Jocko here&#39;s the plan</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.050" end="01:41:19.390" style="s2">now I look at the plan and I say hey</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.989" end="01:41:20.830" style="s2">okay that looks pretty good and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.390" end="01:41:22.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a little nudge I gave you maybe</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.830" end="01:41:24.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a little course correction yeah</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.030" end="01:41:25.810" style="s2">of you but it&#39;s still your plan and and</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.370" end="01:41:28.900" style="s2">now you go and execute the plan when you</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.810" end="01:41:30.910" style="s2">hit an obstacle now out in the field you</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.900" end="01:41:33.070" style="s2">go over it you go around it or you go</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.910" end="01:41:36.219" style="s2">through that obstacle yeah because you</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.070" end="01:41:38.290" style="s2">have ownership of the plan so no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.219" end="01:41:41.890" style="s2">about it that&#39;s that that that</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.290" end="01:41:42.760" style="s2">leadership thing of actually say people</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.890" end="01:41:44.800" style="s2">always talk about leading from the front</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.760" end="01:41:47.230" style="s2">and then you got a lead from the front</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.800" end="01:41:48.610" style="s2">twin and you certainly do but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.230" end="01:41:49.810" style="s2">many times where I want to lead from the</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.610" end="01:41:51.790" style="s2">rear a little bit I want to lead from</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.810" end="01:41:54.370" style="s2">the back up but it can be you know this</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.790" end="01:41:56.530" style="s2">is really theory of follow me where you</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.370" end="01:41:58.300" style="s2">put the highest value person in harm&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.530" end="01:42:00.760" style="s2">way first and it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.300" end="01:42:02.739" style="s2">initially but then you realize okay well</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.760" end="01:42:05.430" style="s2">if he&#39;s willing to go over the side</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.739" end="01:42:08.140" style="s2">first then maybe I&#39;m gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.430" end="01:42:09.610" style="s2">direction from him because he&#39;s putting</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.140" end="01:42:11.860" style="s2">it all on the line yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.610" end="01:42:13.630" style="s2">there are limitations to that plan as</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.860" end="01:42:15.280" style="s2">well sure because if you&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.630" end="01:42:17.020" style="s2">experienced guy and you have the most</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.280" end="01:42:18.400" style="s2">tactical knowledge and you have a full</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.020" end="01:42:19.989" style="s2">understanding and you&#39;re gonna be able</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.400" end="01:42:21.100" style="s2">to make the best decisions in the</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.989" end="01:42:22.630" style="s2">shortest amount of time that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.100" end="01:42:23.770" style="s2">keep everyone alive and you decide</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.630" end="01:42:25.450" style="s2">you&#39;re the one that&#39;s gonna go first and</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.770" end="01:42:27.040" style="s2">you get shot the first step right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.450" end="01:42:28.870" style="s2">what he did wasn&#39;t a good didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.040" end="01:42:30.940" style="s2">and even though I&#39;m following you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.870" end="01:42:32.739" style="s2">I&#39;m following you into a bloodbath so</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.940" end="01:42:34.810" style="s2">what I would rather have you do and this</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.739" end="01:42:36.070" style="s2">this happen all the time with me if if I</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.810" end="01:42:37.480" style="s2">was approaching a building and I happen</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.070" end="01:42:39.969" style="s2">to be one of the first two guys three</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.480" end="01:42:42.160" style="s2">guys on the entry I would take one step</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.969" end="01:42:43.750" style="s2">to the side and my guys knew my guys</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.160" end="01:42:45.310" style="s2">knew exactly that they didn&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.750" end="01:42:47.230" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t predicated on the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.310" end="01:42:49.750" style="s2">nobody that everyone knew that you were</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.230" end="01:42:52.390" style="s2">making a decision for a strategic or</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.750" end="01:42:56.050" style="s2">tactical reason but in order to have</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.390" end="01:42:57.489" style="s2">that known you have to do something that</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.050" end="01:42:59.860" style="s2">demonstrates that you&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.489" end="01:43:02.170" style="s2">for a personal reason yes and and there</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.860" end="01:43:05.980" style="s2">are times there are absolutely times</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.170" end="01:43:08.860" style="s2">where no one&#39;s gonna move until they see</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.980" end="01:43:10.239" style="s2">you move yeah and so you&#39;ve got it again</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.860" end="01:43:11.469" style="s2">this is the dichotomy you can&#39;t lead</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.239" end="01:43:12.340" style="s2">from the front all the time you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.469" end="01:43:13.690" style="s2">lead from the rear all the time</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.340" end="01:43:14.650" style="s2">sometimes got to be up front sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.690" end="01:43:15.940" style="s2">you got to be in the rear sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.650" end="01:43:18.700" style="s2">got to be in the middle you got to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.940" end="01:43:21.190" style="s2">able to modulate that appropriately for</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.700" end="01:43:23.620" style="s2">whatever situation you&#39;re in you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.190" end="01:43:26.649" style="s2">it&#39;s very is very interesting we get to</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.620" end="01:43:29.599" style="s2">watch some of these films from</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.649" end="01:43:32.179" style="s2">Afghanistan and Iraq and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.599" end="01:43:36.979" style="s2">remember particularly poignant films one</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.179" end="01:43:38.360" style="s2">of which was some convoy that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.979" end="01:43:41.989" style="s2">trying to make positive identification</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.360" end="01:43:43.059" style="s2">they decide that its enemy then you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.989" end="01:43:47.630" style="s2">light it up</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.059" end="01:43:50.149" style="s2">fire fire along the convoy and then you</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.630" end="01:43:51.889" style="s2">know there&#39;s sort of muted celebration</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.149" end="01:43:53.659" style="s2">job well done blah blah blah and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.889" end="01:43:55.249" style="s2">like wait we&#39;re getting reports that</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.659" end="01:43:59.209" style="s2">there are friendlies in the area and you</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.249" end="01:44:01.309" style="s2">listen to just like how flipped out</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.209" end="01:44:02.929" style="s2">these people are about what they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.309" end="01:44:07.329" style="s2">in the interpretation another one I</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.929" end="01:44:11.749" style="s2">remember the sniper was talking and</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.329" end="01:44:13.459" style="s2">something to the extent of you know is</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.749" end="01:44:15.709" style="s2">do what do you think about this target</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.459" end="01:44:18.130" style="s2">yes no yes now somebody said something</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.709" end="01:44:20.719" style="s2">like okay well here comes pink mist and</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.130" end="01:44:23.899" style="s2">you know this human being effectively</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.719" end="01:44:26.570" style="s2">evaporates you know with it with a</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.899" end="01:44:29.959" style="s2">well-placed sniper shot and the</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.570" end="01:44:32.539" style="s2">ambiguity of the situation and the</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.959" end="01:44:35.809" style="s2">weight that comes from taking life as</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.539" end="01:44:38.929" style="s2">well as from putting your own life on</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.809" end="01:44:41.510" style="s2">the line you know I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.929" end="01:44:44.269" style="s2">things that those videos have done for</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.510" end="01:44:46.280" style="s2">me is to remind me of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.269" end="01:44:48.349" style="s2">professionalism that we&#39;ve moved towards</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.280" end="01:44:53.119" style="s2">and how seriously people are taking</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.349" end="01:44:55.429" style="s2">these decisions and I worry that in some</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.119" end="01:44:57.769" style="s2">sense we need to update ourselves for</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.429" end="01:45:00.559" style="s2">how much we changed after Vietnam in</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.769" end="01:45:02.689" style="s2">this context well the the opening</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.559" end="01:45:06.139" style="s2">chapter of the first book that I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.689" end="01:45:10.189" style="s2">extreme ownership is about a fratricide</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.139" end="01:45:12.649" style="s2">mean that took place with my guys and I</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.189" end="01:45:14.659" style="s2">was in charge and there was a chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.649" end="01:45:17.539" style="s2">situation I had multiple elements on the</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.659" end="01:45:22.179" style="s2">battlefield including myself all engaged</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.539" end="01:45:25.039" style="s2">in firefights and there was some</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.179" end="01:45:28.459" style="s2">miscommunication there was some non</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.039" end="01:45:33.010" style="s2">communication and there ended up being a</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.459" end="01:45:36.229" style="s2">small element of friendly Iraqi soldiers</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.010" end="01:45:38.360" style="s2">attacking one of the positions that my</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.229" end="01:45:40.489" style="s2">guys were in</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.360" end="01:45:41.449" style="s2">and one of my guys shot and killed an</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.489" end="01:45:44.150" style="s2">Iraqi soldier</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.449" end="01:45:48.230" style="s2">they were then attacked by the Iraqis</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.150" end="01:45:50.420" style="s2">and then the army who then who called in</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.230" end="01:45:54.380" style="s2">as a quick reaction force and engaged my</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.420" end="01:45:57.290" style="s2">guys in a building with 50 caliber</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.380" end="01:45:59.389" style="s2">machine gun yeah I had one of my guys</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.290" end="01:46:05.360" style="s2">wounded there was several other Iraqis</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.389" end="01:46:06.080" style="s2">wounded and all this took place in five</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.360" end="01:46:08.750" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.080" end="01:46:11.060" style="s2">by the time I went down I was in it I</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.750" end="01:46:14.510" style="s2">was a couple blocks away and when when</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.060" end="01:46:16.400" style="s2">my guys called in the what they called</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.510" end="01:46:18.139" style="s2">the heavy QRF for the heavy quick</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.400" end="01:46:21.710" style="s2">reaction force which was a section or</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.139" end="01:46:24.500" style="s2">two m1 Abrams tanks when they called in</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.710" end="01:46:26.270" style="s2">the heavy QRF I told the guys I was with</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.500" end="01:46:30.320" style="s2">I said hey those are my guys were going</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.270" end="01:46:31.940" style="s2">so we went down there and all this had</p>

<p begin="01:46:31.940" end="01:46:38.330" style="s2">minutes but it so that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.570" end="01:46:40.670" style="s2">opening chapters how that happened in</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.330" end="01:46:42.590" style="s2">the book extreme ownership there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.670" end="01:46:44.480" style="s2">other situations that Lafe wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.590" end="01:46:46.369" style="s2">another situation where the very</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.480" end="01:46:47.960" style="s2">situation you&#39;re talking about his</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.369" end="01:46:50.600" style="s2">sniper which was which was Chris Kyle</p>

<p begin="01:47:53.970" end="01:47:57.200" style="s2">the chap one of the chapters I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.500" end="01:47:59.370" style="s2">about is a similar situation there was a</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.200" end="01:48:00.900" style="s2">Bradley Fighting Vehicle the 25</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.370" end="01:48:03.720" style="s2">millimeter chain gun getting ready to</p>

<p begin="01:48:03.720" end="01:48:09.780" style="s2">rooftop of a building and as I</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.630" end="01:48:11.850" style="s2">deciphered the situation and told him</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.780" end="01:48:14.880" style="s2">not to shoot and eventually had them</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.850" end="01:48:17.460" style="s2">confirm exactly by literally I said</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.880" end="01:48:20.190" style="s2">count the buildings from where you are</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.460" end="01:48:21.300" style="s2">to where you see the enemy and they</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.190" end="01:48:23.520" style="s2">counted the buildings and they said I</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.300" end="01:48:25.710" style="s2">stand by we have an adjustment oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.520" end="01:48:28.710" style="s2">and guess who it was it was my guys so</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.710" end="01:48:30.990" style="s2">those horrible situations they unfold</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.710" end="01:48:33.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.990" end="01:48:35.910" style="s2">reality of of combat that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.900" end="01:48:37.710" style="s2">harsh reality of combat well I wish more</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.910" end="01:48:40.800" style="s2">people understood that when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.710" end="01:48:43.920" style="s2">about leadership it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.800" end="01:48:46.530" style="s2">glamorous it&#39;s heart wrenching hard in</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.920" end="01:48:49.110" style="s2">your mouth situations where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.530" end="01:48:51.570" style="s2">even know anything complete information</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.110" end="01:48:53.790" style="s2">what to do and there&#39;s no one there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.570" end="01:48:56.490" style="s2">one to lean on I would imagine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.790" end="01:48:58.410" style="s2">no one to lean on and there&#39;s also no</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.490" end="01:49:00.180" style="s2">one to blame there&#39;s no when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.410" end="01:49:01.040" style="s2">charge every single thing that happens</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.180" end="01:49:03.960" style="s2">on the battlefield</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.040" end="01:49:06.570" style="s2">absolutely is on you well and this is</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.960" end="01:49:09.090" style="s2">where I want to sort of maybe close out</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.570" end="01:49:12.450" style="s2">this this sit down with you although I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.090" end="01:49:14.640" style="s2">love to continue another time as you</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.450" end="01:49:17.780" style="s2">know this this podcast is known as the</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.640" end="01:49:20.400" style="s2">portal and the idea for the portal is</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.780" end="01:49:23.940" style="s2">how to extricate yourself from wherever</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.400" end="01:49:26.630" style="s2">you feel trapped towards some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.940" end="01:49:29.520" style="s2">more transcendent existence and what I</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.630" end="01:49:31.320" style="s2">understand from everything that you do</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.520" end="01:49:33.780" style="s2">and project and I just I feel very</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.320" end="01:49:35.310" style="s2">grateful that I was connected to you by</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.780" end="01:49:38.700" style="s2">some of our mutual friends this is our</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.310" end="01:49:41.580" style="s2">first meeting is this concept of</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.700" end="01:49:44.970" style="s2">liberation through extreme discipline</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.580" end="01:49:46.830" style="s2">and that sounds sort of counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.970" end="01:49:48.330" style="s2">it looks like you have the supress of</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.830" end="01:49:50.730" style="s2">life where you get up in the morning at</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.330" end="01:49:52.650" style="s2">4:30 a.m. you&#39;re taking a picture of</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.730" end="01:49:54.930" style="s2">your wristwatch and there&#39;s sweat</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.650" end="01:49:56.640" style="s2">everywhere and the point is you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.930" end="01:49:58.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a path and you can fall off it</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.640" end="01:50:01.770" style="s2">but if you get back on it and you own it</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.610" end="01:50:03.300" style="s2">there is freedom and liberation even</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.770" end="01:50:04.070" style="s2">though it seems like an oppressive</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.300" end="01:50:06.530" style="s2">regime</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.070" end="01:50:09.200" style="s2">can you talk about this is a portal and</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.530" end="01:50:12.260" style="s2">as a as a way out for people who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.200" end="01:50:15.650" style="s2">understood what they&#39;re capable of doing</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.260" end="01:50:18.830" style="s2">by toughening their mind and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.650" end="01:50:20.300" style="s2">making use of all of these very hard-won</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.830" end="01:50:23.470" style="s2">lessons that you&#39;ve decided to share</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.300" end="01:50:29.260" style="s2">with us from places they&#39;ll never go for</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.470" end="01:50:31.640" style="s2">me when I was a young new guy seal I</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.260" end="01:50:33.080" style="s2">wanted to be a good seal that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.640" end="01:50:35.750" style="s2">what I wanted to do I want it to be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.080" end="01:50:38.800" style="s2">good seal and I looked at other seals</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.750" end="01:50:43.160" style="s2">that were respected for their</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.800" end="01:50:45.890" style="s2">operational capability and I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.160" end="01:50:47.960" style="s2">gonna sit here and tell you that I did</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.890" end="01:50:49.970" style="s2">like a Tim Ferriss assessment of</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.960" end="01:50:51.800" style="s2">breaking down each and everything and</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.970" end="01:50:54.470" style="s2">what what is it that makes a great but I</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.800" end="01:50:57.320" style="s2">looked at them as a young kid and said</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.470" end="01:50:59.120" style="s2">what are they doing that&#39;s making them</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.320" end="01:50:59.930" style="s2">better one of the things I noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.120" end="01:51:02.570" style="s2">they were doing is they got to work</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.930" end="01:51:04.190" style="s2">before I did okay so guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.570" end="01:51:05.990" style="s2">gonna start getting to work earlier I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.190" end="01:51:07.550" style="s2">gonna start getting up earlier in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.990" end="01:51:08.930" style="s2">morning guess what else I do they work</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.550" end="01:51:10.910" style="s2">out every day regardless of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.930" end="01:51:12.380" style="s2">on they get that done Oh guess what else</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.910" end="01:51:14.660" style="s2">they&#39;re doing they&#39;re studying so they</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.380" end="01:51:16.490" style="s2">understand tactics their honor they they</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.660" end="01:51:18.620" style="s2">trained with the weapon systems as much</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.490" end="01:51:21.800" style="s2">as they can so they impose these</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.620" end="01:51:23.330" style="s2">disciplines on themselves and with a</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.800" end="01:51:25.580" style="s2">more discipline they imposed on</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.330" end="01:51:28.330" style="s2">themselves that the better they were so</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.580" end="01:51:32.030" style="s2">when you had somebody that was hard core</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.330" end="01:51:35.810" style="s2">discipline they ended up being a hard</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.030" end="01:51:37.700" style="s2">core operator I saw that and said okay I</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.810" end="01:51:39.380" style="s2">need to and I didn&#39;t even call it</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.700" end="01:51:40.640" style="s2">discipline I just said oh I gotta get it</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.380" end="01:51:43.070" style="s2">to get to work earlier oh I gotta study</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.640" end="01:51:44.870" style="s2">more I gotta train more and then the</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.070" end="01:51:47.120" style="s2">more I did that guess what I&#39;d go to a</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.870" end="01:51:49.370" style="s2">training event and I would have freedom</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.120" end="01:51:50.690" style="s2">there because I was in better condition</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.370" end="01:51:53.420" style="s2">or I understood the weapons better I</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.690" end="01:51:56.030" style="s2">understood the tactics better so or I</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.420" end="01:51:57.470" style="s2">just was more prepared because I had</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.030" end="01:51:59.180" style="s2">gotten to work at five o&#39;clock in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.470" end="01:52:01.130" style="s2">morning and prepped my gear and prepped</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.180" end="01:52:02.480" style="s2">my dive rig before anyone else did so I</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.130" end="01:52:05.390" style="s2">was just a little bit ahead so I could</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.480" end="01:52:07.730" style="s2">spend a little more time doing a chart</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.390" end="01:52:09.590" style="s2">study of the water I was gonna be diving</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.730" end="01:52:12.650" style="s2">in so I kind of got a better lay of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.590" end="01:52:15.530" style="s2">land or of the ocean in this case so</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.650" end="01:52:18.079" style="s2">these little disciplines that I imposed</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.530" end="01:52:20.420" style="s2">on myself made me more equipped</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.079" end="01:52:22.670" style="s2">was gonna what I was gonna face in these</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.420" end="01:52:24.170" style="s2">training situations and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.670" end="01:52:26.360" style="s2">very soon you realize that the more</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.170" end="01:52:28.610" style="s2">discipline you impose on just about</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.360" end="01:52:30.619" style="s2">every aspect of your life the more</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.610" end="01:52:33.409" style="s2">freedom you end up with whether it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.619" end="01:52:34.790" style="s2">know the example of financial freedom if</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.409" end="01:52:36.590" style="s2">you want financial freedom guess what</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.790" end="01:52:38.210" style="s2">you gotta have financial discipline to</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.590" end="01:52:39.770" style="s2">get there if you want to have more free</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.210" end="01:52:41.389" style="s2">time guess what you gotta have more</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.770" end="01:52:44.389" style="s2">discipline time management and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.389" end="01:52:47.150" style="s2">a part of a team then the way that the</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.389" end="01:52:48.679" style="s2">you you if you saw my sealable tune</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.150" end="01:52:50.300" style="s2">you&#39;d see that we had discipline</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.679" end="01:52:51.949" style="s2">standard operating procedures for just</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.300" end="01:52:53.329" style="s2">about everything that we did and you</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.949" end="01:52:55.880" style="s2">might think that that constrains us on</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.329" end="01:53:00.679" style="s2">the battlefield but it actually gives us</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.880" end="01:53:03.440" style="s2">freedom Nana and and that&#39;s the way that</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.679" end="01:53:06.079" style="s2">it is that&#39;s the way that that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.440" end="01:53:10.369" style="s2">that for me discipline in my life has</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.079" end="01:53:14.300" style="s2">given me from my perspective right now</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.369" end="01:53:18.860" style="s2">an immense amount of freedom now as far</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.300" end="01:53:22.610" style="s2">as the portal that that allows someone</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.860" end="01:53:25.099" style="s2">to kind of transition for me another</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.610" end="01:53:29.510" style="s2">thing that I talk about all the time is</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.099" end="01:53:32.389" style="s2">the ability to detach from the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.510" end="01:53:34.360" style="s2">detached from mayhem and detach from</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.389" end="01:53:37.250" style="s2">your emotions so that you can make good</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.360" end="01:53:42.290" style="s2">logical decisions about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.250" end="01:53:45.110" style="s2">doing in your life in the world and this</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.290" end="01:53:48.710" style="s2">is something that I remember the day I</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.110" end="01:53:50.300" style="s2">learned it I was on an oil rig and we</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.710" end="01:53:53.570" style="s2">were doing a training operation on an</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.300" end="01:53:56.270" style="s2">oil rig and we approached one of the the</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.570" end="01:53:58.550" style="s2">the main deck of the oil rig with my</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.270" end="01:53:59.989" style="s2">platoon and everyone gets out on line on</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.550" end="01:54:02.480" style="s2">this platoon we&#39;re all lined up waiting</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.989" end="01:54:03.619" style="s2">for a command to be made whether to go</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.480" end="01:54:05.869" style="s2">left whether to go right whether to go</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.619" end="01:54:11.090" style="s2">forward and no one&#39;s making any decision</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.869" end="01:54:13.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m I I think this is my my first</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.090" end="01:54:17.480" style="s2">platoon so I was a new guy all right and</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.730" end="01:54:19.309" style="s2">I&#39;m waiting and no one&#39;s making any</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.480" end="01:54:20.989" style="s2">decisions because everyone&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.309" end="01:54:23.179" style="s2">I was doing which is staring down the</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.989" end="01:54:26.239" style="s2">barrel of their gun looking for targets</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.179" end="01:54:27.559" style="s2">and I stood there for a second and then</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.239" end="01:54:29.179" style="s2">three seconds then five seconds and I</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.559" end="01:54:31.969" style="s2">said okay I&#39;m just gonna take a step</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.179" end="01:54:33.469" style="s2">back so I lifted my gun into the high</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.969" end="01:54:35.389" style="s2">port position so I wasn&#39;t looking down</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.469" end="01:54:36.949" style="s2">my weapon anymore I took a step back I</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.389" end="01:54:39.499" style="s2">looked to my left I looked to my right I</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.949" end="01:54:43.519" style="s2">saw that no one was looking around to</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.499" end="01:54:45.829" style="s2">make a decision and I said hold left</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.519" end="01:54:47.630" style="s2">clear right which was a common standard</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.829" end="01:54:49.039" style="s2">operating procedure and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.630" end="01:54:50.570" style="s2">repeated the call because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.039" end="01:54:52.670" style="s2">you do in the SEAL Teams when somebody</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.570" end="01:54:54.469" style="s2">makes a verbal call everyone repeats it</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.670" end="01:54:56.269" style="s2">so everyone says you know hold left</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.469" end="01:54:59.749" style="s2">clear right and then everyone held left</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.269" end="01:55:01.820" style="s2">and we cleared right and I realized at</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.749" end="01:55:03.079" style="s2">that moment the oh I was the least one</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.820" end="01:55:05.360" style="s2">of the least tactically experienced</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.079" end="01:55:07.909" style="s2">people but because I had taken a step</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.360" end="01:55:09.590" style="s2">back I was able to see things with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.909" end="01:55:11.449" style="s2">more clarity than anyone else on that</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.590" end="01:55:13.489" style="s2">line could so this is a phrase you use</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.449" end="01:55:16.130" style="s2">take a step back which essentially as</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.489" end="01:55:19.070" style="s2">far as I can tell means go metacognitive</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.130" end="01:55:21.349" style="s2">and witness the robot that is you yes</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.070" end="01:55:23.059" style="s2">acting robotically and find something</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.349" end="01:55:24.650" style="s2">that is not the robot to evaluate the</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.059" end="01:55:28.039" style="s2">situation you have to die just call it</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.650" end="01:55:29.929" style="s2">detach you have a detach from all that</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.039" end="01:55:31.789" style="s2">chaos and what you&#39;re really doing and</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.929" end="01:55:34.130" style="s2">this you know makes me think of your</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.789" end="01:55:36.260" style="s2">portal ideas you&#39;re detaching from you</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.130" end="01:55:38.719" style="s2">right you&#39;re taking a step you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.260" end="01:55:39.619" style="s2">attaching from your own brain and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.719" end="01:55:42.110" style="s2">looking at things from a different</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.619" end="01:55:43.280" style="s2">perspective and the better you get at it</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.110" end="01:55:45.739" style="s2">you know it got to a point where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.280" end="01:55:49.400" style="s2">even have to move and I&#39;m detached and</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.739" end="01:55:50.780" style="s2">I&#39;m looking around so that to me is one</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.400" end="01:55:52.729" style="s2">of the most powerful tools you have as a</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.780" end="01:55:57.800" style="s2">leader and really as a person is to</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.729" end="01:56:00.590" style="s2">instead of be being constantly in the in</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.800" end="01:56:01.670" style="s2">the firefight right take a step back get</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.590" end="01:56:03.710" style="s2">out of the five versus like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.670" end="01:56:05.780" style="s2">watching a football game on TV you watch</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.710" end="01:56:07.729" style="s2">that football game you wonder why these</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.780" end="01:56:09.710" style="s2">idiots on the field can&#39;t see what you</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.729" end="01:56:11.179" style="s2">see well it&#39;s because you&#39;re seeing it</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.710" end="01:56:13.010" style="s2">from 9 different angles or at least an</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.179" end="01:56:14.539" style="s2">elevated angle on the television you can</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.010" end="01:56:16.579" style="s2">see everything that&#39;s happening so if</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.539" end="01:56:19.519" style="s2">you do that with your life you detach</p>

<p begin="01:56:19.519" end="01:56:23.599" style="s2">more visibility on decisions you should</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.739" end="01:56:26.300" style="s2">make and directions you should be also</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.599" end="01:56:27.920" style="s2">both at the level of cognition and at</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.300" end="01:56:31.429" style="s2">the level of emotion and feeling</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.920" end="01:56:33.380" style="s2">absolutely absolutely well this is some</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.429" end="01:56:35.539" style="s2">incredibly powerful advice I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.380" end="01:56:38.119" style="s2">try to put it into action by the way if</p>

<p begin="01:56:42.800" end="01:56:47.219" style="s2">succumbed to eating a piece of cake and</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.699" end="01:56:49.199" style="s2">and he had to get back on the path it is</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.219" end="01:56:52.290" style="s2">one of the most powerful minutes because</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.199" end="01:56:54.719" style="s2">it&#39;s as if he&#39;s locked in combat</p>
