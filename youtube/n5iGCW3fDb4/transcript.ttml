<p begin="00:02:50.360" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">that I want to talk to you about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.769" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">particular exercise I&#39;ll briefly</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">describe it I know that Donnell</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">Robertson is going to take you through</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">the exercise so I&#39;ll do be doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:04.050" style="s2">of the theory and some of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">science and then we&#39;ll do the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.050" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">together so you get sort of the one-two</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">punch what I&#39;m particularly interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">in is how this exercise contributes to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">rationality but what I&#39;m going to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">to do is try and sort of broaden your</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">notion of what rationality is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:20.160" style="s2">part of what the project is so the view</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:22.350" style="s2">from above just very quickly is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.160" end="00:03:25.049" style="s2">imaginative exercise where you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.350" end="00:03:27.060" style="s2">sort of rising above the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.049" end="00:03:29.100" style="s2">seeing it sort of from extended</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.060" end="00:03:31.769" style="s2">elevations and you can also extend it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.100" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">time a broader historical scope imagine</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.769" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">that you&#39;re you&#39;ve been alive for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">thousand years as opposed to well for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">fifty-six all right and that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:44.010" style="s2">things you can immediately think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">is that this action the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.010" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">exercise of imaginatively rising above</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">the earth in this way and getting a view</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">from above is opening up that space</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">opening up the space between impression</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">and response now here&#39;s what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">do I want to reverse engineer the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">exercise with you that&#39;s what I do as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">cognitive scientist I try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">cognition by reverse engineering it what</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:14.100" style="s2">does that mean find a problem that your</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">cognition needs to solve and then fry</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.100" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">the engineer what a solution would look</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:20.910" style="s2">like and then figure out if your</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:22.229" style="s2">cognition is approximating that solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.910" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is to reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">that&#39;s how we&#39;re going about making the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">terrifying artificial intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:33.569" style="s2">is going to make all of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:35.330" style="s2">completely irrelevant joke okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.569" end="00:04:38.099" style="s2">I want to do is set the problem with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">and as I&#39;m setting the problem I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.099" end="00:04:41.189" style="s2">to try to introduce these ideas to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.870" end="00:04:42.719" style="s2">that we should broaden in order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.189" end="00:04:45.509" style="s2">broaden the notion of rationality we</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.719" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">need to broaden the kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.509" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">familiar with propositional knowing but</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">I want to talk about procedural and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:54.330" style="s2">especially perspectival in participatory</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">knowing you don&#39;t know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.330" end="00:04:57.900" style="s2">right now that&#39;s why I&#39;m here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:02.159" style="s2">because what that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.900" end="00:05:04.650" style="s2">you okay now I want to talk about a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.159" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">of rationality that I guess colored</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.650" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">calls proleptic rationality and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:13.469" style="s2">actually right instantiated in the view</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:14.789" style="s2">from above as a practice then I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.469" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">talk to you about the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.789" end="00:05:18.719" style="s2">of the view from above what&#39;s cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:20.159" style="s2">science saying about this practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.719" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually telling us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.159" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">about it&#39;s what it&#39;s doing to our</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:30.509" style="s2">cognition and our consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">I want to confront a problem because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.509" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">view from the above can look an awful</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:36.659" style="s2">lot like the view from nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.440" end="00:05:37.979" style="s2">the Thomas Nagel famously talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.659" end="00:05:40.949" style="s2">and the thing about the view from</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.979" end="00:05:43.229" style="s2">nowhere is it provokes cosmic absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.949" end="00:05:44.879" style="s2">and a sense of meaninglessness and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.229" end="00:05:47.219" style="s2">know it&#39;s going to take away any joy in</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.879" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">life from you a pervasive sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.219" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">meaninglessness so how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:56.069" style="s2">the view from above doesn&#39;t become the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.500" end="00:05:58.830" style="s2">view from nowhere and then I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.069" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">try and propose a solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.830" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">making use of some ideas from Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">and some current philosophy ok so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:09.930" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">so stoicism your is trying about bring</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.740" end="00:07:17.219" style="s2">changing what you&#39;re capable of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.340" end="00:07:18.900" style="s2">those are two different things so let me</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.219" end="00:07:21.689" style="s2">give you an example you have a</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.689" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">is just a sponge right I&#39;ve had raised</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.599" end="00:07:28.529" style="s2">two sons and like I know what this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:30.539" style="s2">like they&#39;re just taking in so much</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.539" end="00:07:35.009" style="s2">development because although they can</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.699" end="00:07:57.029" style="s2">that 6 is more than five and five is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.169" end="00:07:59.219" style="s2">more than four do you understand you</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.029" end="00:08:00.990" style="s2">count out 5 candies 1 2 3 4 5 you count</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.990" end="00:08:05.370" style="s2">but you space them like this 1 2 3 4 5</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">do you see the difference and you ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.370" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">them which row do you want you know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">they all reliably pick the bottom row</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:14.969" style="s2">now how many of you would fall prey to</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.740" end="00:10:09.510" style="s2">myself and Leo Ferraro in 2013 argued</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:11.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit elliptical because</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.510" end="00:10:13.290" style="s2">real and illusory are comparative terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.610" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">you only know something&#39;s illusory in</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:24.200" style="s2">so we broadened it right seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.330" end="00:10:27.870" style="s2">illusion and into reality now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.200" end="00:10:30.690" style="s2">really important because what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.870" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">talking about here is a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.690" end="00:10:37.020" style="s2">kind of insight what do I mean by</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.860" end="00:10:51.390" style="s2">what it is to be in a particular stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.330" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">so you&#39;ve all had an insight experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.390" end="00:10:54.030" style="s2">hey well you realize oh I&#39;ve miss frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:56.940" style="s2">the problem and you have that AHA</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.030" end="00:10:58.620" style="s2">experience yes but notice what the child</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.940" end="00:11:00.570" style="s2">has to do though the child can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.620" end="00:11:02.850" style="s2">have a single aha here in this problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.570" end="00:11:05.010" style="s2">the child has to figure out there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.010" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">have a systemic comp</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">that here and here so that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:16.170" style="s2">don&#39;t fall prey to any of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:18.899" style="s2">illusions anymore you&#39;ve had a very</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.990" end="00:11:53.550" style="s2">you of one I&#39;ve had those formulations</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.430" end="00:11:55.529" style="s2">of wisdom right in fact and it was</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:13.020" style="s2">you as an adult need to go through huge</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.279" end="00:12:26.390" style="s2">something I study I study illusion under</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.430" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">the idea of self-deception</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.060" end="00:20:59.690" style="s2">participatory knowing is if I go through</p>

<p begin="00:21:13.460" end="00:21:16.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve just shown you propositional</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:18.500" style="s2">knowledge isn&#39;t the same thing as</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.010" end="00:21:40.100" style="s2">gets you this and you sort of go yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.210" end="00:21:42.200" style="s2">get that and then she goes and you face</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.100" end="00:21:45.550" style="s2">these decisions all the time here&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:22:00.030" style="s2">can order propositions to you but all</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.420" end="00:22:01.950" style="s2">the parents about yet get that totally</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.780" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">Lori makes you can&#39;t infer your way</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.120" end="00:22:27.000" style="s2">through this because you don&#39;t know the</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.160" end="00:22:56.520" style="s2">something because the word rationality</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">has been invoked a lot but when we hear</p>

<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:01.400" style="s2">have people saying rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:04.770" style="s2">syllogistic reasoning so they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.400" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">along that rationality is reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.770" end="00:23:10.020" style="s2">propositional argumentation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:11.610" style="s2">fundamental mistake because if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.020" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">all rationality is it doesn&#39;t touch</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:21.480" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t help you go through</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.030" end="00:23:27.510" style="s2">transformation Jerry Fodor gives a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.480" end="00:23:29.910" style="s2">similar argument he basically says well</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.510" end="00:23:31.590" style="s2">he thought that all of cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.910" end="00:23:33.450" style="s2">computation just inferentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.590" end="00:23:36.750" style="s2">manipulating propositions and altering</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.450" end="00:23:41.420" style="s2">beliefs that&#39;s all it is to think and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.750" end="00:23:43.620" style="s2">then he famously said okay if pre oj is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.420" end="00:23:45.180" style="s2">you know we take piace at his word</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.620" end="00:23:47.790" style="s2">people are going through a change in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.180" end="00:23:50.340" style="s2">competence what does that mean well that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.790" end="00:23:53.040" style="s2">means a change from a weaker logic to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.340" end="00:23:55.230" style="s2">stronger logic that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.040" end="00:23:58.120" style="s2">if I&#39;m changing my competence and all I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.230" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">am is computational I have to be making</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.120" end="00:24:02.919" style="s2">a stronger logic from a weaker logic but</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:05.830" style="s2">you know what you can&#39;t do you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.919" end="00:24:09.010" style="s2">infer a stronger logic from a weaker</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.830" end="00:24:11.380" style="s2">logic I can&#39;t do that because I have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.010" end="00:24:14.620" style="s2">ah this is a pretty good DeLeon reasons</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.380" end="00:24:16.809" style="s2">I have to step outside my axioms and my</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.620" end="00:24:17.980" style="s2">functions and introduce new axioms and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.809" end="00:24:20.230" style="s2">functions so he came to this bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.980" end="00:24:21.789" style="s2">conclusion he said therefore Piaget is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.230" end="00:24:23.770" style="s2">wrong there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.789" end="00:24:25.210" style="s2">development that&#39;s it&#39;s all totally</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.730" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">else went what but but you could turn it</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.890" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">around it&#39;s a modus tollens the way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.330" style="s2">getting out of that ridiculousness is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:39.820" style="s2">say that&#39;s because most of your</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.330" end="00:24:44.620" style="s2">cognition contrary to what we believe is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.820" end="00:24:46.210" style="s2">not computational in nature because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.620" end="00:24:48.010" style="s2">have machines that can do exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.210" end="00:24:50.350" style="s2">photos said we couldn&#39;t do their neural</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.010" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">networks that use dynamical systems and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.350" end="00:25:00.010" style="s2">use self-organization to get you through</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.450" end="00:25:02.140" style="s2">through this change so how can you be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.010" end="00:25:06.789" style="s2">rational how can you aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.140" end="00:25:10.140" style="s2">rationality if rationality can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.789" end="00:25:10.140" style="s2">use of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.350" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">so that takes me to a final note</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.440" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">developed by Agnes a Callard she talks</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.669" style="s2">about in her book aspiration this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:31.150" style="s2">process of you where you genuinely</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.150" end="00:25:38.830" style="s2">that&#39;s right I notice how the value</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.320" end="00:25:41.159" style="s2">combines your skill what you find</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.830" end="00:25:44.140" style="s2">salient and a change in your identity</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.020" end="00:25:59.049" style="s2">can motivate them not a love of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.610" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">classical music because you know what</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:05.260" style="s2">a love of classical music so what do</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:07.059" style="s2">they do what are they well they take a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.260" end="00:26:08.919" style="s2">music appreciation class and they go</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.059" end="00:26:10.299" style="s2">through these exercises that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.919" end="00:26:12.010" style="s2">designed to transform them and notice</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.299" end="00:26:15.309" style="s2">what this word appreciation brings with</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.010" end="00:26:18.909" style="s2">it it brings with it the notion right</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.909" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">transforming again your salience</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.890" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">landscape what you find salient what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:27.940" style="s2">find relevant but also transforming your</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:30.130" style="s2">identity who and what you are changing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.940" end="00:26:32.500" style="s2">your understanding appreciation also</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.130" end="00:26:34.120" style="s2">carries with it that an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.500" end="00:26:38.110" style="s2">unlike knowing the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.120" end="00:26:39.700" style="s2">understanding and knowing is to know is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.110" end="00:26:42.490" style="s2">to be able to assert with evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.700" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">proposition understanding is to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.490" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">its significance or relevance</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.370" end="00:26:54.860" style="s2">now why is all this important to colored</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.940" end="00:26:56.300" style="s2">well she says notice what we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.860" end="00:26:59.150" style="s2">here people are going through these</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.300" end="00:27:01.690" style="s2">these processes of gaining and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.150" end="00:27:05.000" style="s2">appreciation and transforming themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.690" end="00:27:06.380" style="s2">and they can&#39;t infer their way through</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.000" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">it for all the reasons I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.380" end="00:27:10.010" style="s2">articulated so what do they do</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">like I said well they&#39;re doing all these</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.010" end="00:27:13.880" style="s2">practices and they&#39;re sort of playing</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:17.150" style="s2">with their salience landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.880" end="00:27:19.010" style="s2">playing with their identity now if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.150" end="00:27:23.090" style="s2">say because that&#39;s not an argumentative</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.010" end="00:27:28.040" style="s2">process it&#39;s not rational we&#39;re in deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.090" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">trouble because of this one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.040" end="00:27:33.080" style="s2">things as a stoic I&#39;m doing is aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:35.930" style="s2">to be more rational and if the process</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.080" end="00:27:37.850" style="s2">of aspiration is itself not a rational</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.930" end="00:27:39.980" style="s2">process because it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.850" end="00:27:43.870" style="s2">argumentative process you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.980" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">can&#39;t do I can&#39;t justify cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.870" end="00:27:52.520" style="s2">rationality to you okay if you take note</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:53.930" style="s2">that process of aspiration is not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.520" end="00:27:55.820" style="s2">rational process because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.930" end="00:27:58.040" style="s2">argumentation that you know what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.820" end="00:28:01.250" style="s2">rational the aspiration to become</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.040" end="00:28:03.650" style="s2">rational I can&#39;t ever justify or</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.250" end="00:28:08.600" style="s2">persuade you to become rational and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.650" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the disaster for rationality so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.600" end="00:28:13.790" style="s2">we have to include this aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:16.210" style="s2">process in our model of rationality she</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.790" end="00:28:19.930" style="s2">calls this proleptic rationality</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.210" end="00:28:19.930" style="s2">proleptic rationality</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.030" end="00:28:31.510" style="s2">okay now what we should ask ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.010" end="00:28:33.130" style="s2">well I do because I&#39;m a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.510" end="00:28:35.230" style="s2">scientists and psychologists yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.130" end="00:28:39.970" style="s2">a lot not a lot of sort of nice abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.230" end="00:28:42.040" style="s2">hand waving how do you do it how do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.970" end="00:28:48.910" style="s2">go through aspiration how do you engage</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.040" end="00:28:50.830" style="s2">in proleptic rationality well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.910" end="00:28:55.270" style="s2">couple things you should note first of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.830" end="00:28:57.880" style="s2">all we need to be triggering a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.270" end="00:29:01.030" style="s2">insight the capacity for systemic</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.880" end="00:29:02.680" style="s2">insight is there a cognitive style that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.030" end="00:29:05.800" style="s2">we have experimental evidence will bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.680" end="00:29:08.260" style="s2">about systemic insight not just at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.800" end="00:29:10.270" style="s2">propositional level but how my salience</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.260" end="00:29:13.240" style="s2">landscape is taking shape and how my</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:14.650" style="s2">sense of self is being transformed yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.240" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">there is such a Cardian style that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.650" end="00:29:19.810" style="s2">mindfulness practice that&#39;s why do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:21.550" style="s2">research on it and you&#39;re worried here</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.810" end="00:29:27.220" style="s2">now he&#39;s sneaking in Buddhism I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.550" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">it well pay attention to the science we</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.220" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">have a lot of good work that all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:34.540" style="s2">these principles are efficacious they</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.970" style="s2">are basically put in place by cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.540" end="00:29:38.920" style="s2">behavioral therapy which is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.970" end="00:29:40.900" style="s2">most evidence-based effective therapy</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.920" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">that we have right now but you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.900" end="00:29:49.660" style="s2">what&#39;s happening its effectiveness is</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:51.370" style="s2">actually declining why because we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.660" end="00:29:53.050" style="s2">gotten focused on propositional</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.370" end="00:29:55.060" style="s2">techniques and the alteration of belief</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.050" end="00:29:57.550" style="s2">and we&#39;ve lost a lot of the intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.060" end="00:30:00.100" style="s2">skill that the original right the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.550" end="00:30:02.590" style="s2">originators of CBT had we&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.100" end="00:30:04.990" style="s2">contact with the perspectival and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.590" end="00:30:06.250" style="s2">participatory knowing transformation so</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.990" end="00:30:08.140" style="s2">what&#39;s the evidence showing you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.250" end="00:30:10.660" style="s2">what works better than CBT on its own</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.140" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">giving people CBT and training them in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.660" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">mindfulness that&#39;s what the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">clearly indicating</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.490" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">so notice what mindfulness is it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.350" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">attention it&#39;s not an inference practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:31.010" style="s2">it&#39;s an attentional practice you shut</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">off inference in fact and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.010" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">doing is using attention to alter your</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:39.490" style="s2">salience landscape and alter your sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:44.299" style="s2">of self in a profound and engaged manner</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.490" end="00:30:45.799" style="s2">so we need that right away what else</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.299" end="00:30:49.399" style="s2">though well let&#39;s go back to LA Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.799" end="00:30:50.899" style="s2">example people want to have a kid what</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.399" end="00:30:52.309" style="s2">do they do well they don&#39;t just sit</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.899" end="00:30:55.490" style="s2">there going I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.309" end="00:30:57.529" style="s2">don&#39;t know some you know people just</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.490" end="00:30:59.080" style="s2">fall into Darwinian impulse I get that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.529" end="00:31:02.389" style="s2">but let&#39;s say people who are doing it as</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.080" end="00:31:05.210" style="s2">a decision not as an impulse because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.389" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">should decide right what do they do well</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.210" end="00:31:10.070" style="s2">I sort of looked around and I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:13.370" style="s2">people doing this sort of bizarre thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.070" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">they get a dog they get a dog and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.370" end="00:31:19.130" style="s2">they&#39;ll have family pictures of them and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:20.149" style="s2">the dog I was like whoa well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.130" end="00:31:22.279" style="s2">thinking about getting in a romantic</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.149" end="00:31:26.889" style="s2">relationship with this person and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.279" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">there&#39;s go on a trip with them oh I</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.889" end="00:31:33.049" style="s2">think what&#39;s going on there what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:35.059" style="s2">on is this really interesting thing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.049" end="00:31:37.279" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the key to development</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.059" end="00:31:39.139" style="s2">because this is how children primarily</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.279" end="00:31:43.610" style="s2">go through those changes we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.139" end="00:31:45.559" style="s2">about this is enacted play in act it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.610" end="00:31:46.730" style="s2">serious play like when we use the word</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.559" end="00:31:50.200" style="s2">play when we&#39;re talking about playing</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.730" end="00:31:52.970" style="s2">music it&#39;s enacted play</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.200" end="00:31:55.970" style="s2">you say well adults don&#39;t do that oh you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.970" end="00:31:57.470" style="s2">better not say that because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.970" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">thing that&#39;s growing right now for</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.470" end="00:32:01.639" style="s2">example in Norwegian countries countries</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:04.909" style="s2">that are really facing the bite of kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.639" end="00:32:07.309" style="s2">of a very successful in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.909" end="00:32:08.870" style="s2">secularism and I&#39;m not dissing that but</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.309" end="00:32:11.990" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a bit of a backlash to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.870" end="00:32:13.549" style="s2">that success this meaning crisis that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.990" end="00:32:15.470" style="s2">you if you if you ask me a single</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.549" end="00:32:16.639" style="s2">question about this right now I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.470" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">talking for seven hours so I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.639" end="00:32:23.350" style="s2">go into the meeting crisis all right</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:23.350" style="s2">watch my series please okay anyways</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.460" end="00:32:27.240" style="s2">what they do they have they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.580" end="00:32:28.230" style="s2">live-action role-playing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.240" end="00:32:30.210" style="s2">you know role-playing games like</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.230" end="00:32:33.030" style="s2">Dungeons &amp; Dragons but in live-action</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.210" end="00:32:36.540" style="s2">you act it out right they have a thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.030" end="00:32:37.860" style="s2">called Jeep form so Jeep form is instead</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.540" end="00:32:40.560" style="s2">of a Dungeon Master you rolling dice</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.860" end="00:32:43.860" style="s2">you&#39;re acting right you&#39;re acting at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.560" end="00:32:45.780" style="s2">scene and there&#39;s the dungeon master is</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.860" end="00:32:48.360" style="s2">like a director and the director will</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.780" end="00:32:49.830" style="s2">set up the scene cut the scene get you</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.360" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">to switch roles suddenly give you this</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.830" end="00:32:52.410" style="s2">and say this is a gun what&#39;re you gonna</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.160" end="00:33:11.480" style="s2">bleed you&#39;re trying to get so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.510" end="00:33:14.460" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the act the play</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.480" end="00:33:17.190" style="s2">bleeds over to a real problem in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.460" end="00:33:19.350" style="s2">real life where you&#39;re considering going</p>

<p begin="00:41:22.189" end="00:41:25.789" style="s2">sort of above the earth and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.989" end="00:41:27.079" style="s2">the solar system and then the galaxy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.789" end="00:41:29.299" style="s2">then of you know what I could do I can</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.479" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">everyday absurdity is so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.329" end="00:41:54.410" style="s2">understand cosmic absurdity so Nagel</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:41:57.709" style="s2">gives this wonderful example now notice</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.410" end="00:41:59.390" style="s2">when he wrote 71 and 80 so this is in</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.939" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">was in a place and you left it there and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.339" end="00:42:08.359" style="s2">you had to return to your phone at</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:10.130" style="s2">different times right and then you put a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.359" end="00:42:12.469" style="s2">recording machine but you remember these</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.130" end="00:42:12.920" style="s2">dark days okay so because here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.469" end="00:42:16.369" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.920" end="00:42:20.660" style="s2">so here&#39;s tom and tom has been working</p>

<p begin="00:42:24.799" end="00:42:27.890" style="s2">the phone be picked up click he goes</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.539" end="00:42:43.429" style="s2">pathos oh you oh poor Tom I notice first</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.199" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">of all that there&#39;s humor there</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.429" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">and what&#39;s humor humor is about a clash</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:52.519" style="s2">of perspective that gets resolved with</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:54.469" style="s2">play so absurdity is when we have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.519" end="00:42:55.549" style="s2">clash of perspectives that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.469" end="00:42:58.939" style="s2">resolve with play because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.549" end="00:43:00.709" style="s2">happening with Tom Tom has this one</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.939" end="00:43:01.939" style="s2">perspective this one sentence landscape</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.779" end="00:43:10.099" style="s2">and this salience landscape is there and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.279" end="00:43:12.289" style="s2">then this other perspective a third</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.099" end="00:43:14.299" style="s2">person in personal perspective slams</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.289" end="00:43:17.479" style="s2">into his perspective the perspective of</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.110" end="00:43:30.580" style="s2">there&#39;s perspectival clash when you go</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.580" end="00:43:36.610" style="s2">compare it to your life right here right</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.020" end="00:43:56.500" style="s2">notice something that Nagel points out</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.610" end="00:43:58.690" style="s2">he points out that many of the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.500" end="00:44:01.870" style="s2">people use for absurdity are technically</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.420" end="00:44:57.960" style="s2">because if we know how to deal with the</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.960" end="00:45:03.640" style="s2">right we know what to do to keep the</p>
