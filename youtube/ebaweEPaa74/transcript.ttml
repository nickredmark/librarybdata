<p begin="00:11:07.620" end="00:11:13.069" style="s2">like it could be that in a society the</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.069" end="00:11:19.500" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s dysfunctional</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.770" end="00:21:14.030" style="s2">much harder to just have an embedded</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:24.919" style="s2">this and one or two examples so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">situational awareness can be achieved</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.140" end="00:22:22.520" style="s2">thoughts on that and I have a question</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.570" end="00:22:24.830" style="s2">the follow-up well that article is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.520" end="00:22:27.230" style="s2">nearly a month old and at the start of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.830" end="00:22:29.180" style="s2">the article I was unfortunately there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.230" end="00:22:32.090" style="s2">a less elated you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.180" end="00:22:34.670" style="s2">a less positive a less you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.090" end="00:22:35.720" style="s2">interesting line where I said that in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.670" end="00:22:38.060" style="s2">few months there will be tens of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.720" end="00:22:39.470" style="s2">thousands of dead Americans and some</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.060" end="00:22:40.760" style="s2">people who read this or like some are</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.470" end="00:22:42.680" style="s2">you really comfortable making that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.760" end="00:22:45.920" style="s2">prediction and I very much was</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.680" end="00:22:48.350" style="s2">comfortable making that prediction so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.920" end="00:22:51.190" style="s2">had assumed the hierarchical structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.350" end="00:22:54.470" style="s2">of the CDC had failed I had assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:57.110" style="s2">the executive structure of the US had</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.470" end="00:22:59.090" style="s2">failed so it was not care you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.110" end="00:23:01.700" style="s2">presidency was not going to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.090" end="00:23:05.030" style="s2">handle an extraordinary situation though</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.700" end="00:23:07.850" style="s2">arguably that&#39;s one of its functions I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.030" end="00:23:10.120" style="s2">certainly was not expecting intervention</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.850" end="00:23:13.010" style="s2">at a government or non-government level</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.120" end="00:23:15.650" style="s2">so the fastest intervention that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.010" end="00:23:17.540" style="s2">work with a six day doubling time right</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.650" end="00:23:19.610" style="s2">even though of course in the wild an</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.540" end="00:23:22.990" style="s2">exponential is never an exponential it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.610" end="00:23:25.040" style="s2">always broken by some things right I</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.990" end="00:23:27.110" style="s2">still think you know the doubling time</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.040" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">of six days was very instructive in</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.110" end="00:23:31.400" style="s2">optimal conditions you might have it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:35.140" style="s2">know the number of infected might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.400" end="00:23:37.670" style="s2">doubled every six days in such</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.140" end="00:23:41.720" style="s2">circumstances I don&#39;t think bringing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.670" end="00:23:44.450" style="s2">together committees or the informal</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.720" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">network of influence and information are</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.450" end="00:23:51.140" style="s2">fast enough so what I thought should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:53.150" style="s2">done is individuals should be appointed</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.140" end="00:23:56.810" style="s2">just with the authority to handle this</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.150" end="00:23:59.420" style="s2">specific issue and no other and rule</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.810" end="00:24:00.980" style="s2">should be suspended so they can do what</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.420" end="00:24:03.680" style="s2">need to be and bring together whichever</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.980" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">agencies need to be brought together to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.680" end="00:24:07.490" style="s2">do particular steps to you know do</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:09.500" style="s2">things such as if it&#39;s the right move to</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.500" end="00:24:13.100" style="s2">one of the requirements for such a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.570" end="00:24:15.080" style="s2">person to have good judgment was</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.100" end="00:24:17.480" style="s2">actually an overlap good judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.080" end="00:24:19.130" style="s2">knowledge right so they actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.480" end="00:24:20.900" style="s2">be they actually have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.130" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">knowledgeable right they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.900" end="00:24:26.200" style="s2">smart and brave because timidity I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.960" end="00:24:29.320" style="s2">is like one of the great curses of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.200" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">people with knowledge especially today</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.320" end="00:24:36.110" style="s2">because in many ways there is a negative</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:38.180" style="s2">selection for it right sometimes in many</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.110" end="00:24:40.670" style="s2">positions throughout say government and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.180" end="00:24:42.980" style="s2">society today being strategically</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.130" end="00:24:54.260" style="s2">needed to be like firmly bypassed</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.309" end="00:24:55.970" style="s2">because in the u.s. you know perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.260" end="00:24:58.250" style="s2">more similar to China than would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.970" end="00:25:01.850" style="s2">comfortable testing was not readily</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.250" end="00:25:03.559" style="s2">available and perhaps it was you know a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.850" end="00:25:05.630" style="s2">disaster</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.559" end="00:25:08.030" style="s2">perhaps it simply was that no one was</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.630" end="00:25:10.190" style="s2">prepared or simply they didn&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.030" end="00:25:11.390" style="s2">numbers to be too high at least at first</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.190" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t didn&#39;t want to panic</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.390" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">people and I think the second</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:16.760" style="s2">interpretation that they just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:21.559" style="s2">want to panic people and were</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.760" end="00:25:25.030" style="s2">downplaying it by by limiting D testing</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.559" end="00:25:27.650" style="s2">I think that&#39;s quite plausible hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.030" end="00:25:31.010" style="s2">the word that was really salient for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.650" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">was heroism and then your distinction</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:37.429" style="s2">mind as well and I really loved that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.270" end="00:25:39.770" style="s2">distinction so maybe you could elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.429" end="00:25:41.450" style="s2">what that means and when I feel into</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.770" end="00:25:44.210" style="s2">that and reflect on that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.450" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">virtue comes to mind as you know</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.460" end="00:25:52.760" style="s2">elaborate on what that distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.169" end="00:25:57.500" style="s2">and maybe how being a life player</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.760" end="00:25:58.820" style="s2">relates to being virtuous um well the</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.070" end="00:34:05.499" style="s2">it&#39;s seen as initiating a turf war</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.779" end="00:34:09.250" style="s2">essentially almost always I think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.499" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">limits it it a little bit I think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.250" end="00:34:16.089" style="s2">there is a lot of opportunity for people</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:18.250" style="s2">to Unger sleight themselves in the land</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.089" end="00:34:19.869" style="s2">so I think there will be a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.250" end="00:34:22.539" style="s2">who if they are in an economically</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.869" end="00:34:24.549" style="s2">privileged position already will realize</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.539" end="00:34:27.129" style="s2">that they are unhappy with their job in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.549" end="00:34:28.809" style="s2">important ways and will quit and find</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.129" end="00:34:31.569" style="s2">something else hopefully something more</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.809" end="00:34:34.329" style="s2">productive possibly even decide to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.569" end="00:34:35.980" style="s2">create new things but again I do have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.329" end="00:34:38.619" style="s2">emphasize this is you know a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.980" end="00:34:40.839" style="s2">class of society the class of society</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.619" end="00:34:43.659" style="s2">that can afford leisure for most people</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.839" end="00:34:45.220" style="s2">you know do if they lose their job right</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.659" end="00:34:49.299" style="s2">now they will have to find another job</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.220" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">and this you know space for reflection</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.299" end="00:34:55.089" style="s2">personal growth personally driven</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:57.849" style="s2">creation is notably undercut by those</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.089" end="00:35:01.869" style="s2">circumstances at least in practice like</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.849" end="00:35:03.730" style="s2">in theory I think or for particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.869" end="00:35:05.829" style="s2">individuals for outliers you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.730" end="00:35:08.289" style="s2">definitely even under the conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.829" end="00:35:10.690" style="s2">you know economic deprivation achieve</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.289" end="00:35:11.859" style="s2">such results and find and figure out new</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.690" end="00:35:14.230" style="s2">ways in which you can deploy your</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.859" end="00:35:16.900" style="s2">judgment and perhaps find a better</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.230" end="00:35:19.930" style="s2">hierarchy of judgment to work in than</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.900" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">the current one but I&#39;m just saying you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.930" end="00:35:24.520" style="s2">know which outcomes I I think we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:26.710" style="s2">you won&#39;t see I also think remote work</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.520" end="00:35:28.660" style="s2">is unfortunately going to be followed by</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.710" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">remote surveillance so I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.660" end="00:35:32.799" style="s2">gonna happen is instead of us allowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:34.839" style="s2">workers to work on their own matters at</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.799" end="00:35:37.480" style="s2">home what&#39;s actually going to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.839" end="00:35:38.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s going to accept that if they</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.480" end="00:35:40.569" style="s2">were working remotely</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.440" end="00:35:41.720" style="s2">your boss has spyware installed on your</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.569" end="00:35:46.010" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.720" end="00:35:47.630" style="s2">but only during work hours however how</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.010" end="00:35:50.119" style="s2">many jobs have we had where the work</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.630" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">hours are perhaps significantly fake and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.119" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">to stay saying you have to do some non</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:58.369" style="s2">work things while plausibly pretending</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">to work I think that a lot of the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.369" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">in in an industrial economy are like</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:05.300" style="s2">this unfortunately so the click will</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:09.619" style="s2">then be surveillance will move from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.300" end="00:36:12.140" style="s2">office to you know your laptop and most</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.619" end="00:36:16.119" style="s2">people I know they use their work</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.140" end="00:36:19.550" style="s2">laptops for personal stuff - right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.119" end="00:36:22.520" style="s2">the observation at home will suddenly be</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.550" end="00:36:24.470" style="s2">normalized so that&#39;s a negative outcome</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.520" end="00:36:26.869" style="s2">and that&#39;s more societal than individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.470" end="00:36:30.770" style="s2">but I hope I answered your question</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.869" end="00:36:36.319" style="s2">Daniel yeah you uh you put put some</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:37.700" style="s2">names to my fears thank you Samuel are</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.319" end="00:36:40.730" style="s2">you good to stay about ten minutes after</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.700" end="00:36:42.349" style="s2">the hour yes okay because we had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.730" end="00:36:43.430" style="s2">of good questions so if anyone has to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.349" end="00:36:45.020" style="s2">leave they can leave any time they want</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.430" end="00:36:46.540" style="s2">this will be recorded and posted on on</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.020" end="00:36:48.500" style="s2">YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.540" end="00:37:12.260" style="s2">Yoshio would you like to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.500" end="00:37:14.150" style="s2">and ask your question trend qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.260" end="00:37:15.800" style="s2">quantitative risk management and safety</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.150" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">culture institutions I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.800" end="00:37:19.069" style="s2">paralleled in society as well safety</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:23.180" style="s2">culture but is also prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.069" end="00:37:27.380" style="s2">institutions are there similar</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.180" end="00:37:33.740" style="s2">criticisms between safety culture in</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.380" end="00:37:36.650" style="s2">society and in institutions well</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.740" end="00:37:38.690" style="s2">cultures can definitely have cultures</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.650" end="00:37:42.490" style="s2">can have different safety settings right</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.690" end="00:37:45.530" style="s2">different safety cultures you know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.490" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">think looking at Japan and comparing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.530" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">Japan to Italy or to India or to Britain</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:54.630" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find some very different</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:57.510" style="s2">defaults that pervade all of society</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.630" end="00:38:00.570" style="s2">if you have a lost object the object is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.510" end="00:38:04.500" style="s2">notably more likely to be returned if</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.570" end="00:38:07.350" style="s2">you are in a public space mask-wearing</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.500" end="00:38:09.060" style="s2">is completely normal and normalized I</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.350" end="00:38:11.550" style="s2">think in the West if someone&#39;s wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.060" end="00:38:13.650" style="s2">mask whether they have a cold or a flu</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.550" end="00:38:15.000" style="s2">knot you&#39;re talking about deadly</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.650" end="00:38:17.120" style="s2">influenza I&#39;m just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.000" end="00:38:19.380" style="s2">everyday elements it&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.120" end="00:38:21.960" style="s2">strange that you&#39;re wearing a mask it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.380" end="00:38:24.330" style="s2">unusual what you have to hide in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.960" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">of East Asian societies the norm is more</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.330" end="00:38:28.650" style="s2">like oh you&#39;re probably sick and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:30.540" style="s2">trying to keep us safe or if it&#39;s China</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.650" end="00:38:32.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah I know the air pollution</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.540" end="00:38:34.250" style="s2">is really bad it causes me breathing</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.220" end="00:38:37.020" style="s2">problems too it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.250" end="00:38:39.210" style="s2">so I think in Japan the air is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.020" end="00:38:41.670" style="s2">clean at least for now well you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.210" end="00:38:44.450" style="s2">western-style industrial society so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.670" end="00:38:47.610" style="s2">think the people are wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.450" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">implicitly to protect others and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.610" end="00:38:54.060" style="s2">this is culturally understood</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:57.570" style="s2">additionally it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.060" end="00:38:59.880" style="s2">understood that if you see an object in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.570" end="00:39:01.320" style="s2">US you know this is less good for</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:03.210" style="s2">disease spread you should not be</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.320" end="00:39:05.100" style="s2">touching strange things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.210" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">where they are but there&#39;s a pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.100" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">element where it routinely happens that</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:15.150" style="s2">you know children might lose small</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.400" end="00:39:17.250" style="s2">completely irrelevant toys in say a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.150" end="00:39:19.490" style="s2">supermarket or something and yet these</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.250" end="00:39:22.860" style="s2">are brought to the lost-and-found desk</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.490" end="00:39:27.420" style="s2">like that expects that is interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.860" end="00:39:29.580" style="s2">suggests that the belief is that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.420" end="00:39:32.490" style="s2">level of trust the level of trust is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.580" end="00:39:35.820" style="s2">high that it&#39;s worthwhile to say to find</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.490" end="00:39:37.890" style="s2">to bring something to the lost and found</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">or go check to the lost and found</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.890" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">because both the person seeking for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.500" end="00:39:45.270" style="s2">lost item and the person finding the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:47.670" style="s2">item they both believe that they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.270" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">what they&#39;re supposed to do right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.670" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">it&#39;s worthwhile to go to lost and found</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:54.120" style="s2">versus buying the kid another toy</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:55.950" style="s2">because you have such high expectations</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.120" end="00:39:58.230" style="s2">of the behavior of your fellow citizens</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.950" end="00:40:00.180" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s a direct analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.230" end="00:40:01.740" style="s2">safety culture I&#39;m also gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.180" end="00:40:07.290" style="s2">another thing when the Fukushima power</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.740" end="00:40:08.500" style="s2">plant you know accident disaster you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.290" end="00:40:11.290" style="s2">might call it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.500" end="00:40:14.230" style="s2">and there were a lot of calls from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.290" end="00:40:16.660" style="s2">elderly who were previously workers at</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.230" end="00:40:19.840" style="s2">power plants at nuclear power plants who</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.660" end="00:40:23.500" style="s2">volunteered for the hazardous work there</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.840" end="00:40:26.230" style="s2">that is a remarkably high level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.500" end="00:40:28.300" style="s2">social conscientiousness and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.230" end="00:40:31.240" style="s2">because I think despite all the issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.300" end="00:40:33.730" style="s2">of having a structurally old society the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.240" end="00:40:37.210" style="s2">elderly in Japan are loved and respected</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.730" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">but also they the elderly themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.210" end="00:40:42.760" style="s2">think of the rest of society as their</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:45.490" style="s2">children their grandchildren their true</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.760" end="00:40:49.210" style="s2">responsibilities so the level of overall</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.490" end="00:40:51.580" style="s2">orientation is there&#39;s a nice mutualism</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.210" end="00:40:53.020" style="s2">between generations and I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.580" end="00:40:56.230" style="s2">u.s. unfortunately the level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.020" end="00:40:59.080" style="s2">mutualism is low you know I will say</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.230" end="00:41:01.540" style="s2">it&#39;s higher than people think there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.080" end="00:41:05.860" style="s2">a lot of you know online there was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.540" end="00:41:09.310" style="s2">of negativity about say boomers versus</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.860" end="00:41:11.170" style="s2">Millennials are now sumers Gen Z but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.310" end="00:41:11.530" style="s2">think that no one wants their grandma to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.170" end="00:41:14.860" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.530" end="00:41:16.420" style="s2">no one wants their dad today so people</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.940" end="00:48:17.170" style="s2">question can we make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.340" end="00:48:18.760" style="s2">between and safety culture versus a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.170" end="00:48:20.530" style="s2">culture of responsibility given that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.760" end="00:48:22.150" style="s2">health and safety has become the</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.150" end="00:48:28.270" style="s2">infantilization in our society yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.590" end="00:48:30.700" style="s2">think that the point about</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.270" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">infantilization through medicalization</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.700" end="00:48:36.670" style="s2">is interesting I would also point out</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:39.900" style="s2">that the medicalization of issues is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.670" end="00:48:42.250" style="s2">often an authority grab or a power grab</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.900" end="00:48:44.440" style="s2">pretty straightforwardly there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.250" end="00:48:47.140" style="s2">extreme examples like you saw in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.440" end="00:48:49.540" style="s2">Soviet Union there used to exist a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.140" end="00:48:52.210" style="s2">psychiatric diagnosis called sluggishly</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.810" end="00:49:14.490" style="s2">Beauty to what I just described think of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.850" end="00:49:16.020" style="s2">how much more elegant that is to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.490" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">of a dissident than say putting them in</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.020" end="00:49:20.220" style="s2">a gulag you put them in a gulag you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.310" end="00:50:05.820" style="s2">questionable so a lot of what I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:09.450" style="s2">question in our own society is the over</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.820" end="00:50:11.310" style="s2">diagnosis of depression where what I do</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.450" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">believe is there are many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.310" end="00:50:16.140" style="s2">feeling miserable and having have a lack</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:18.060" style="s2">of meaning in their life but I believe</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.140" end="00:50:20.430" style="s2">we tend to pretend that this is some</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.060" end="00:50:23.820" style="s2">mysterious society-wide</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.430" end="00:50:27.450" style="s2">mental health crisis rather than perhaps</p>

<p begin="00:50:27.450" end="00:50:31.950" style="s2">and unlivable for significant portions</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.880" end="00:50:34.080" style="s2">of the population so the medicalised</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.950" end="00:50:36.870" style="s2">response is very interesting it is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.080" end="00:50:39.930" style="s2">response of the authorities to you as an</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.870" end="00:50:42.810" style="s2">individual rather than perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.930" end="00:50:45.750" style="s2">response of the authorities with society</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.810" end="00:50:51.500" style="s2">or even the authorities with society</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.750" end="00:50:54.420" style="s2">right and another one is medicalization</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.500" end="00:50:57.110" style="s2">implies you should internalize the costs</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.420" end="00:51:01.110" style="s2">and listen to someone outside of you</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.110" end="00:51:04.350" style="s2">versus you know a more creative or</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.110" end="00:51:06.180" style="s2">collaborative frame where actually you</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.350" end="00:51:09.780" style="s2">should internalize the costs and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.180" end="00:51:11.340" style="s2">the ultimate decision-maker or we should</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.780" end="00:51:13.620" style="s2">externalise some of the costs and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.340" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">decision making is made together or</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.620" end="00:51:17.060" style="s2">perhaps at least you know you</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:18.440" style="s2">being told what to do but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.060" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">not paying the price of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.440" end="00:51:22.280" style="s2">being told what to do right so you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:23.960" style="s2">also have a social contract that goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.280" end="00:51:26.570" style="s2">more in that direction and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.960" end="00:51:31.070" style="s2">attempted by some of those some of those</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.570" end="00:51:34.070" style="s2">countries so I think that safety culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.070" end="00:51:35.990" style="s2">versus responsibility culture I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.070" end="00:51:38.080" style="s2">you know you can never have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.990" end="00:51:41.540" style="s2">bureaucratic rule set that covers all</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.080" end="00:51:45.370" style="s2">details all functional safety cultures</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.540" end="00:51:48.380" style="s2">have to be responsibilities cultures</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.370" end="00:51:49.490" style="s2">unless you have a bias towards it is my</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.380" end="00:51:51.980" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.490" end="00:51:55.160" style="s2">there is no accident here or there is no</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.980" end="00:51:57.230" style="s2">disaster here it will be much too easy</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.160" end="00:51:59.600" style="s2">for events to slip through where it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.230" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">one&#39;s responsibility to make it go well</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.600" end="00:52:03.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s better to have an overly</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:06.140" style="s2">developed sense of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.530" end="00:52:08.510" style="s2">proactively fix things and be grateful</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.140" end="00:52:10.450" style="s2">to others when others proactively fix a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.510" end="00:52:12.950" style="s2">problem you were supposed to fix and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.450" end="00:52:17.060" style="s2">have it be that them doing that is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.950" end="00:52:18.890" style="s2">bad for you that I think is the only way</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.060" end="00:52:21.530" style="s2">to develop a real safety culture either</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.890" end="00:52:26.090" style="s2">in an organization or in society at</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.530" end="00:52:27.230" style="s2">large all right so I think that&#39;s a good</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.230" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll make some closing announcements in</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:35.660" style="s2">closing thoughts anything you&#39;d like to</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.660" end="00:52:41.720" style="s2">grateful for the thoughtful questions I</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.120" end="00:52:44.510" style="s2">think that one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.720" end="00:52:47.810" style="s2">often neglected is the overlap of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.510" end="00:52:50.030" style="s2">personal emotional life with the social</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.810" end="00:52:52.820" style="s2">interpersonal life of small scale with</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.030" end="00:52:55.160" style="s2">the large institutionalized life in</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.820" end="00:52:59.360" style="s2">society right things like hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.160" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">prisons governments they shape water</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.360" end="00:53:04.970" style="s2">cooler conversations families you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:07.100" style="s2">church communities these shape the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.970" end="00:53:08.570" style="s2">individual emotional life of people and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.100" end="00:53:10.880" style="s2">what motivates them and how they go</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.570" end="00:53:13.460" style="s2">through life the full stack of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.880" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">developments that&#39;s something I really</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.460" end="00:53:18.200" style="s2">hope we can all think about more and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:20.540" style="s2">integrate more in our public discourse</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.200" end="00:53:24.140" style="s2">rather than chop it up into you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.540" end="00:53:26.870" style="s2">mental health or economics or political</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.140" end="00:53:29.180" style="s2">science or philosophy if you neatly pack</p>

<p begin="00:53:29.180" end="00:53:33.559" style="s2">economics into its own little box well</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.400" end="00:53:35.300" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to be a live player then</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.559" end="00:53:37.250" style="s2">right like we can only have dead players</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.300" end="00:53:39.710" style="s2">we can only operate off of narrow</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.250" end="00:53:43.700" style="s2">recommendations of scripts rather than</p>
