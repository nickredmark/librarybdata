<p begin="00:00:32.559" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">about even when you make that twenty</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.239" end="00:00:37.600" style="s2">when you make twenty thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:38.960" style="s2">per month then you up it to fifty</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.600" end="00:00:39.520" style="s2">thousand then you up it to a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.960" end="00:00:40.879" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.520" end="00:00:42.879" style="s2">then you&#39;re making a million dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.879" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t sound like freedom to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">that sounds like an addiction you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:52.160" style="s2">happy where you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">are you need twenty thousand and yeah</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">but to say that&#39;s the minimum and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:00:59.199" style="s2">to say that it has to keep increasing</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">and increasing</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.199" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">that is the definition of an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">and it is playing out in society</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">like we are addicts and is costing all</p>
