<p begin="00:01:40.530" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">with Inspiral how does it work what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:49.500" style="s2">it first came to my attention back in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">the early game B days 1.0 the 2013 when</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.500" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">we investigated loomio as a possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">organizing tool we kind of looked a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">little bit at in spiral well probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">not as deeply as we should have we ended</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:02.610" style="s2">up not picking loomio ended up using</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">Basecamp instead but tell us about in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.610" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">spiral where to come from what does it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:07.120" style="s2">do where is it today</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.570" style="s2">I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.120" end="00:02:12.460" style="s2">to always give this disclaimer that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.570" end="00:02:13.870" style="s2">Inspiral is a very complex system and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.460" end="00:02:15.790" style="s2">everyone you ask will have a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.870" end="00:02:17.740" style="s2">story about what it is but I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.790" end="00:02:19.390" style="s2">you my version of the truth and you sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.740" end="00:02:22.240" style="s2">of have to start take many samples to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.390" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">get a full picture but it&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.240" end="00:02:25.540" style="s2">hundred people there originated in New</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.310" end="00:02:27.370" style="s2">Zealand and so a lot of those people</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.540" end="00:02:29.530" style="s2">live in New Zealand but now I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.370" end="00:02:33.580" style="s2">maybe a third or more of them live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:35.500" style="s2">other countries around the world and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.580" end="00:02:37.960" style="s2">are supporting each other to do more</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.500" end="00:02:39.850" style="s2">meaningful work whatever that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.960" end="00:02:42.130" style="s2">so we haven&#39;t defined what meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.850" end="00:02:44.380" style="s2">work is we say it&#39;s stuff that matters</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.130" end="00:02:46.150" style="s2">and that that implies that what matters</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.380" end="00:02:48.430" style="s2">to you if it matters to you it matters</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.150" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">to us and we don&#39;t have to put a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.430" end="00:02:53.260" style="s2">tight definition on what that is so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:54.760" style="s2">kind of a community of friends who trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.260" end="00:02:57.190" style="s2">each other a lot and do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.760" end="00:03:00.250" style="s2">experimentation with different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.190" end="00:03:02.500" style="s2">organizing and making small cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.250" end="00:03:04.060" style="s2">and businesses just a huge variety of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.500" end="00:03:06.730" style="s2">different little small businesses that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.060" end="00:03:09.220" style="s2">all have overlapping brands and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.730" end="00:03:12.190" style="s2">overlapping people and yeah we do a ton</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.220" end="00:03:13.630" style="s2">of experimentation with how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.190" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">we prototype the organization of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.630" end="00:03:18.970" style="s2">future where we&#39;re working together on</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:21.820" style="s2">on relationships of trust and equality</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.970" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">and freedom and autonomy and those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.820" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">of things and and move away from the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:30.160" style="s2">of organizing which is this top-down</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:32.709" style="s2">coercive hierarchical control system</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.160" end="00:03:34.690" style="s2">where people are you know like my my</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.709" end="00:03:37.030" style="s2">experience before I worked at in spiral</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.690" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">I always felt that you know like work is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.030" end="00:03:41.380" style="s2">supposed to suck more or less and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">why they pay you to go there whereas</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.380" end="00:03:44.770" style="s2">with in spiral we&#39;re trying to do a kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">of work that&#39;s really life-giving really</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.770" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">fun really meaningful really purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">and and to get paid decent money for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:54.489" style="s2">doing it so that&#39;s the grand experiment</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:57.820" style="s2">and it basically came out of the sky</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.489" end="00:03:59.380" style="s2">Joshua vial he&#39;s a he&#39;s a deep dude</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.820" end="00:04:02.800" style="s2">another one that you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.380" end="00:04:05.739" style="s2">interview one day and he just had this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.800" end="00:04:07.720" style="s2">experience of trying to he&#39;s an engineer</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.739" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">and a programmer so he&#39;s got quite an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.720" end="00:04:10.870" style="s2">analytical brain and he came to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.940" style="s2">conclusion one day that he had something</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.870" end="00:04:15.489" style="s2">like I forget the numbers I think he</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.940" end="00:04:17.260" style="s2">said he had 80,000 hours of he could</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.489" end="00:04:19.540" style="s2">expect roughly 80,000 hours of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.260" end="00:04:21.160" style="s2">productive life in him and he&#39;d already</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.540" end="00:04:22.990" style="s2">used that some fraction of that during</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.160" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">his programming work and then he did</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.990" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">some some sort of modeling of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">what&#39;s the most positive impact that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:32.260" style="s2">can have in the world with the remainder</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:35.020" style="s2">of those hours and he in the modeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.260" end="00:04:36.460" style="s2">who became very obvious that one man</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.020" end="00:04:37.900" style="s2">working as hard as he likes on any</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.460" end="00:04:40.870" style="s2">program project is not going to get very</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.900" end="00:04:42.280" style="s2">far compared to mobilizing a community</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.870" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">of people that are all working on stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.280" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">and so he set his mind to yeah how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">recruit a collective of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:51.750" style="s2">all working on systems change and how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.780" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">we do that in a way that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.750" end="00:04:56.139" style="s2">prototyping the new systems that we want</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:58.060" style="s2">to live in from the start very cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.139" end="00:05:01.030" style="s2">could you give me example of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.060" end="00:05:04.060" style="s2">businesses that have spun up under the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.030" end="00:05:08.410" style="s2">Inspiral umbrella sure there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.060" end="00:05:09.820" style="s2">variety so it tends to have a tech side</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.410" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s that we&#39;ve got a lot of tech people</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.820" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">in the community you mentioned Vimeo so</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">I&#39;m one of the cofounders of loomio and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:16.900" style="s2">net that&#39;s kind of interesting it came</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:19.630" style="s2">out of the Occupy movement where we had</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:22.900" style="s2">this experience of self-organizing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.630" end="00:05:24.460" style="s2">collective decision-making and and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.900" end="00:05:26.200" style="s2">part of the Occupy movement and then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.460" end="00:05:27.940" style="s2">met the folks at and spiral and it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.200" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">sort of from that overlap of those two</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.940" end="00:05:33.970" style="s2">communities that Lumia were merged as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">tech platform that&#39;s run by a worker</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.970" end="00:05:38.350" style="s2">owned cooperative that&#39;s trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:40.990" style="s2">business for good so that&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.350" end="00:05:43.810" style="s2">it&#39;s ongoing ongoing project and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.990" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">there&#39;s the developer academy so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.810" end="00:05:47.950" style="s2">a programming school essentially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:49.750" style="s2">like a boot camp for for teaching people</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.950" end="00:05:51.850" style="s2">how to be excellent programmers with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.750" end="00:05:53.889" style="s2">sort of Trojan horse mission of actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.850" end="00:05:55.900" style="s2">teaching programmers about relational</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.889" end="00:05:57.490" style="s2">skills and emotional intelligence then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.900" end="00:05:58.990" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a few of us because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.490" end="00:06:00.910" style="s2">been doing all this experimentation with</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.990" end="00:06:03.010" style="s2">different ways of organizing there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.910" end="00:06:05.380" style="s2">increasing number of what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.010" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">insultingly management consultants like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:10.540" style="s2">myself who you know have views on how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">design organizations in a new way so</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.540" end="00:06:14.070" style="s2">greater-than is a really nice one they</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:16.300" style="s2">they do a lot of work especially around</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.070" end="00:06:18.040" style="s2">collaborative funding and financing they</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.300" end="00:06:19.480" style="s2">have you if you&#39;ve got a membership</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.040" end="00:06:21.790" style="s2">organization with thousands of people in</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.480" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">it how can they participate in setting</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.790" end="00:06:24.280" style="s2">the budgets their organization for</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:26.169" style="s2">instance so they do a lot of work around</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.280" end="00:06:28.840" style="s2">there and there are a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.169" end="00:06:31.300" style="s2">little little software shops usually</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.840" end="00:06:31.930" style="s2">it&#39;s three four five six people working</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.300" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.930" end="00:06:36.759" style="s2">as software consultants and just making</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.600" end="00:06:37.720" style="s2">a little a little temporary brand so</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.759" end="00:06:39.130" style="s2">that they can work together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.720" end="00:06:41.289" style="s2">sometimes these brands coalesce to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.130" end="00:06:43.240" style="s2">bigger projects very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.289" end="00:06:46.419" style="s2">together does that make a full-time</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.240" end="00:06:48.130" style="s2">living for 200 people or are some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.419" end="00:06:51.070" style="s2">these people still keeping their game a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.130" end="00:06:53.500" style="s2">jobs there&#39;s definitely a real mix after</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.070" end="00:06:55.300" style="s2">the call I can share with you an impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.500" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">report that was done recently that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.300" end="00:06:58.090" style="s2">will actually have the numbers in it I</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:00.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know the most top of my head but</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.090" end="00:07:02.830" style="s2">there&#39;s at least a third of us would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.340" end="00:07:04.690" style="s2">full-time living in this new economy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.830" end="00:07:07.090" style="s2">in probably a third that are part-time</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.690" end="00:07:09.479" style="s2">and then probably the last third more or</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.090" end="00:07:11.830" style="s2">less are earning their living in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.479" end="00:07:13.300" style="s2">traditional jobs and traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.830" end="00:07:14.620" style="s2">organizations but they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.300" end="00:07:16.810" style="s2">something else from their connection to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.620" end="00:07:18.340" style="s2">the community whether that&#39;s inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.810" end="00:07:19.870" style="s2">or friendship or connections or</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.340" end="00:07:22.810" style="s2">opportunities or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.870" end="00:07:25.330" style="s2">that&#39;s actually good to my mind because</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.810" end="00:07:28.180" style="s2">it shows a ramp right people can engage</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.330" end="00:07:30.280" style="s2">at various levels and we think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.180" end="00:07:32.169" style="s2">this a fair amount in our game be world</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.280" end="00:07:34.330" style="s2">that people do not jump up a cliff in</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.169" end="00:07:37.090" style="s2">general or a few maniacs do I will</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.330" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">probably you would but most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.090" end="00:07:41.349" style="s2">right they want to they want to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:41.590" style="s2">their risk by taking a small step at a</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.349" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.590" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">so being associated in some sense in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:48.550" style="s2">which my living isn&#39;t on the line is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">lower risk way to start and then doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.550" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">part-time work as a next natural</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">evolution for some of the people then</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:56.199" style="s2">becoming full-time and actually living</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.210" style="s2">it you know is the third step so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.199" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">actually like the fact that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.210" end="00:08:02.440" style="s2">have fallen out that way it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:04.210" style="s2">congruent with human nature and the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.440" end="00:08:06.009" style="s2">that the majority of people the vast</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.210" end="00:08:08.770" style="s2">majority people actually would prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.009" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">proceed rather than suddenly going from</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.770" end="00:08:15.099" style="s2">A to B shall we say hmm if for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:17.259" style="s2">it&#39;s like a transvestite strategy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.099" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">think I so I come from this background</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.259" end="00:08:21.340" style="s2">which is basically Anika is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.630" style="s2">anti-capitalist and this oppositional</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.340" end="00:08:24.970" style="s2">kind of activist identity and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.630" end="00:08:27.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve grown out of that somewhat and now</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.970" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">I&#39;m in this place where I really I love</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.370" end="00:08:30.940" style="s2">the strategy of transverse meant so</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:32.909" style="s2">taking money out of one system and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.940" end="00:08:35.050" style="s2">putting it in another you know not being</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.909" end="00:08:36.310" style="s2">oppositional ii anti-capitalist but</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.050" end="00:08:38.380" style="s2">getting your hands on the capital and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.310" end="00:08:39.789" style="s2">putting it to good use and mobilizing on</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.380" end="00:08:41.079" style="s2">a different set of principles you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.789" end="00:08:42.219" style="s2">so that it&#39;s but it&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.079" end="00:08:43.340" style="s2">something better in the world than just</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.219" end="00:08:45.740" style="s2">make money for</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.340" end="00:08:47.570" style="s2">and she capitalists that&#39;s funny that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:49.670" style="s2">great because we have the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.570" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">concept for our game beam movement even</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.670" end="00:08:54.260" style="s2">though we&#39;re not as far along which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:55.460" style="s2">we call it parasitizing game a right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.260" end="00:08:56.990" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.460" end="00:08:59.060" style="s2">management consultant we currently are</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.990" end="00:09:01.640" style="s2">having a discussion about what are some</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.060" end="00:09:04.210" style="s2">of the game be ventures that we believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.640" end="00:09:07.310" style="s2">would allow us to actually out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.210" end="00:09:09.410" style="s2">game a entities and oddly we&#39;ve come up</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.310" end="00:09:11.450" style="s2">with things like auto repair garages</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.410" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">which are famously corrupt at least in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.450" end="00:09:16.400" style="s2">the United States management consulting</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:19.250" style="s2">which is high priced low value in many</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.400" end="00:09:20.570" style="s2">cases and even ad agencies that are you</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.250" end="00:09:22.790" style="s2">know sort of full of the worst kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.570" end="00:09:24.230" style="s2">predatory sociopaths and we think we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.790" end="00:09:25.670" style="s2">do a better job in all those things than</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.230" end="00:09:27.830" style="s2">think that you guys found management</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.670" end="00:09:30.410" style="s2">consulting also to what degree is there</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.830" end="00:09:31.940" style="s2">some kind of shared economics amongst</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.410" end="00:09:33.830" style="s2">these various working groups like for</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.940" end="00:09:36.260" style="s2">instance that&#39;s in spiral itself have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.830" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">central account where it can provide</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.260" end="00:09:39.830" style="s2">some startup capital for these other</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">working groups and is there some you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.830" end="00:09:42.050" style="s2">know payment back from the working</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:43.460" style="s2">groups what are the working groups just</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.050" end="00:09:44.990" style="s2">stand on their own bottom and do their</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.460" end="00:09:47.240" style="s2">own thing hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.990" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">well I guess the important principles</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.240" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">here are we&#39;ve done a ton of different</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:54.980" style="s2">experimentation and so whenever someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">asks you know is this that of capital</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.980" end="00:09:59.180" style="s2">available is there a collective fund</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:00.590" style="s2">have you tried exchanging equity the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.180" end="00:10:02.120" style="s2">answer is always yes because we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.590" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">done so many experiments over the last</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.120" end="00:10:07.730" style="s2">decade and the other other important</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:09.410" style="s2">principle is what we&#39;ve learnt is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.730" end="00:10:10.400" style="s2">matters most is the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.410" end="00:10:12.890" style="s2">relationships that you&#39;re maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.400" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">the trust and their and the openness of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.890" end="00:10:15.590" style="s2">communication between all these people</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:18.710" style="s2">regardless of what experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.590" end="00:10:20.540" style="s2">you&#39;re doing so with those provisos the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.710" end="00:10:23.840" style="s2">way it currently works everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.540" end="00:10:26.750" style="s2">collective is contributing at least a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.840" end="00:10:29.300" style="s2">tiny little membership contribution you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.750" end="00:10:30.500" style="s2">know so that could be $5 a month some</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.300" end="00:10:31.580" style="s2">people are doing a lot more than that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.500" end="00:10:33.740" style="s2">you know that if they&#39;re in a position</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.580" end="00:10:35.840" style="s2">where they&#39;re earning a lot of income</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.740" end="00:10:38.030" style="s2">and they they attribute some of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.840" end="00:10:39.290" style="s2">income to and spiral so so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.030" end="00:10:41.270" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing management consulting</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.290" end="00:10:44.900" style="s2">work and you&#39;ve got a really high day</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">rate and you know that you get you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.900" end="00:10:47.660" style="s2">that you&#39;re benefiting from the Inspiral</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:49.880" style="s2">brand then you might be in a position</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.660" end="00:10:51.140" style="s2">when you&#39;re going to share ten or</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.880" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">fifteen percent of your income with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.140" end="00:10:54.830" style="s2">collective and all of that money goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:10:56.300" style="s2">into a central fund and then at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.830" end="00:10:56.790" style="s2">moment I think roughly half of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.300" end="00:10:59.280" style="s2">income</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.790" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">just covers some of our essential stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.280" end="00:11:03.420" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got a few Community Managers</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:05.490" style="s2">someone&#39;s writing a newsletter we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.420" end="00:11:07.170" style="s2">our technology you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.490" end="00:11:09.870" style="s2">sort of basic administration to run a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.170" end="00:11:12.360" style="s2">network of 200 people and then on top of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.870" end="00:11:14.850" style="s2">that the rest is discretionary spending</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.360" end="00:11:17.640" style="s2">and so we essentially run a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.850" end="00:11:20.940" style="s2">internal crowdfunding where anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.640" end="00:11:24.270" style="s2">propose to spend the collective money so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.940" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">usually usually once we have sort of ten</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.860" end="00:11:38.040" style="s2">need five thousand dollars to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.540" end="00:11:39.870" style="s2">started with that could you fund me or</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.040" end="00:11:41.940" style="s2">it could be I want to go to a conference</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.870" end="00:11:43.530" style="s2">and talk about it spiral or the kids</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.940" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">really creative you know sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.530" end="00:11:46.980" style="s2">like we&#39;re having events and I want to</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.980" end="00:11:51.210" style="s2">great if we had a fund available for</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.140" end="00:11:53.340" style="s2">people who need counseling or conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.210" end="00:11:55.650" style="s2">mediators and so on so it&#39;s really I</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.340" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve I&#39;ve got a fund called The</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:00.930" style="s2">mother and I ran around dispensing $100</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.580" end="00:12:03.150" style="s2">bills on people for writing blog posts</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.930" end="00:12:04.710" style="s2">on the Inspiral blog you know so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.150" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">just a huge amount of creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.710" end="00:12:09.840" style="s2">what we do with that shared economy so</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:11.670" style="s2">there&#39;s that layer which is not a huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.840" end="00:12:14.910" style="s2">amount of money given given you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.670" end="00:12:17.520" style="s2">200 people most of whom earning</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.910" end="00:12:19.560" style="s2">reasonable money but then this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.520" end="00:12:23.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a layer underneath set which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.560" end="00:12:24.390" style="s2">more at their the small scale with what</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.010" end="00:12:27.060" style="s2">different language for we call them</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.390" end="00:12:28.950" style="s2">cruise or pods livelihood pods they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.060" end="00:12:32.070" style="s2">basically small cooperatives where</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.950" end="00:12:33.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll have maybe five or six people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.070" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">are consultants that could they could go</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.960" end="00:12:36.630" style="s2">out into the market as independent</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">freelancers and make a living that way</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.630" end="00:12:41.100" style="s2">but they coalesce into these small</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:43.140" style="s2">groups where they get the Solidarity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.100" end="00:12:46.920" style="s2">working in the team and and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.140" end="00:12:48.630" style="s2">to take on bigger jobs and also we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.920" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">income pooling and those small groups so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.630" end="00:12:51.810" style="s2">that you take out the the peaks and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:54.450" style="s2">troughs out of your income and you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.810" end="00:12:55.890" style="s2">just have a stable salary where if</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.450" end="00:12:56.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a good trust between four or</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.890" end="00:12:59.490" style="s2">five consultants you know each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.970" end="00:13:00.930" style="s2">well it turns out you can you can share</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.490" end="00:13:02.280" style="s2">all of your income either it&#39;s some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.930" end="00:13:04.410" style="s2">them are doing it in a full communist</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.280" end="00:13:06.030" style="s2">way where it&#39;s like all the money goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.410" end="00:13:07.380" style="s2">into one place and then everyone takes</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.030" end="00:13:09.130" style="s2">what they need out of it and then other</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.380" end="00:13:10.690" style="s2">ones they&#39;re a bit more towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.130" end="00:13:12.190" style="s2">the capitalists end of the spectrum so</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.690" end="00:13:13.930" style="s2">they&#39;ll have some kind of allocation</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:15.970" style="s2">formula where it&#39;s you know it depends</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.930" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">on how much how many hours did you put</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.970" end="00:13:19.300" style="s2">in and what&#39;s your hourly rate and so on</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:21.070" style="s2">and you have some kind of complicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.300" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">algorithm for determining how much money</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.070" end="00:13:25.240" style="s2">to share with each other but that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">to me is the more interesting part is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.240" end="00:13:29.580" style="s2">the the kind of financial solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">that happens at the really small scale I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.580" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">like that very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.670" end="00:13:37.420" style="s2">is the pluralism in how the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.640" style="s2">groups are organized</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.420" end="00:13:42.100" style="s2">I see implicitly that some people as you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.640" end="00:13:44.620" style="s2">said full communism and one extreme some</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.100" end="00:13:46.150" style="s2">kind of contractual sharing economy</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.620" end="00:13:48.400" style="s2">capitalism at the other and probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.150" end="00:13:50.860" style="s2">lots of things in between and at least</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.400" end="00:13:53.410" style="s2">my take is we don&#39;t yet know what really</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.860" end="00:13:55.180" style="s2">works in this what comes next world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.410" end="00:13:56.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to do a bunch of experiments</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.180" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">to find out so it sounds like you guys</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.890" end="00:14:00.070" style="s2">are doing several experiments in</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:01.780" style="s2">parallel on you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.070" end="00:14:04.900" style="s2">financial sharing within your own</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.780" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">organization and and what we do know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.900" end="00:14:08.080" style="s2">that works at least this is my strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:10.180" style="s2">opinion so far from from the experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.080" end="00:14:12.580" style="s2">for the last decade is is this emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.180" end="00:14:15.310" style="s2">on small groups so like there was an</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.580" end="00:14:17.650" style="s2">earlier phase of Inspiral where the main</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.310" end="00:14:19.420" style="s2">activity was basically a large</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.650" end="00:14:21.250" style="s2">freelancers collective with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.420" end="00:14:23.950" style="s2">plus people in it they were all sharing</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.250" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">the brand of Inspiral services and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.950" end="00:14:27.910" style="s2">was essentially one or two people in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:29.170" style="s2">middle of that system who who were</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.910" end="00:14:31.300" style="s2">actually the business owners who</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.170" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">actually understood the overall system</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.300" end="00:14:35.620" style="s2">whereas most people were were just</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:36.850" style="s2">playing their part as an individual and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.620" end="00:14:38.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t really have a sense of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.850" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">and and it didn&#39;t work you know like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.950" end="00:14:43.480" style="s2">there was some real problems with their</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:46.270" style="s2">model where we had problems beer fits</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.480" end="00:14:48.820" style="s2">for instance there&#39;s this dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.270" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">setup with risk where one person and out</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.820" end="00:14:52.270" style="s2">of that collective over 100 could</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">tarnish your brand but by having a bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.270" end="00:14:55.810" style="s2">interaction with a customer right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like we we learned over time that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.810" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">instead of having this one enormous</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:03.100" style="s2">collective of people trying to do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:05.350" style="s2">sort of peace love and sharing money</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.100" end="00:15:09.400" style="s2">thing distributing it into many small</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.350" end="00:15:10.510" style="s2">pools where there&#39;s a independent brand</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.400" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">for each one of those there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.510" end="00:15:13.960" style="s2">independent legal entity people have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:15.970" style="s2">understand the ins and outs of running a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.960" end="00:15:17.350" style="s2">business at that scale and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.970" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">a lot of collaboration that happens</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.350" end="00:15:20.500" style="s2">across those borders people are coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:21.590" style="s2">and going between those borders all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.500" end="00:15:23.570" style="s2">time but there&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.590" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">of cell boundaries there to keep that to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.570" end="00:15:27.830" style="s2">keep the incentives square I like it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:29.570" style="s2">sounds like you guys have learned some</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.830" end="00:15:32.690" style="s2">things from your experiments and are now</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.570" end="00:15:34.670" style="s2">converging towards a replicatable model</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.690" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">I&#39;m actually gonna skip ahead there cuz</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.670" end="00:15:39.770" style="s2">that sets me up for a later topic on my</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:42.290" style="s2">list of the several medium posts that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.770" end="00:15:44.570" style="s2">read and in this case reread to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.290" end="00:15:47.150" style="s2">ready for this podcast one that hopped</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.570" end="00:15:49.520" style="s2">out to me is almost central to your</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.150" end="00:15:53.750" style="s2">thinking is titled micro solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.520" end="00:15:55.010" style="s2">number two and in that you lay out a and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:15:58.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the one where you talk about self</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.010" end="00:16:00.500" style="s2">dyad the crew etc you talk about and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.310" end="00:16:02.690" style="s2">think an extraordinarily practical way</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.500" end="00:16:06.620" style="s2">and one that at least got my attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.690" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">an idea for how we organize at multiple</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.620" end="00:16:10.010" style="s2">layers you want to go over that talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:13.670" style="s2">about that a little bit why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.010" end="00:16:15.050" style="s2">important hmm sure so the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.670" end="00:16:18.350" style="s2">think about it and like I said at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.050" end="00:16:20.090" style="s2">start you know my my take on in spiral</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.350" end="00:16:21.380" style="s2">is just one of many and other folks will</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.090" end="00:16:23.810" style="s2">have a different approach and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.380" end="00:16:25.340" style="s2">want to I don&#39;t want to be the end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.810" end="00:16:27.350" style="s2">the story but I am chatting at one</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.340" end="00:16:29.840" style="s2">particular ascent up the mountain you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.350" end="00:16:31.490" style="s2">know and and so that that&#39;s just a just</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.840" end="00:16:33.470" style="s2">to own my subjectivity on that piece but</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.490" end="00:16:35.180" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;ve articulated there</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.470" end="00:16:36.590" style="s2">somehow is having resonance and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.180" end="00:16:38.960" style="s2">different contexts so it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.590" end="00:16:43.100" style="s2">doing some good the way that I look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.960" end="00:16:46.340" style="s2">it is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s all about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.100" end="00:16:48.200" style="s2">practice a kind of relationship there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.340" end="00:16:49.640" style="s2">built on different premises than the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.200" end="00:16:51.530" style="s2">that I was raised with you know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.640" end="00:16:54.430" style="s2">there on the top-down hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.530" end="00:16:58.340" style="s2">command and control isolated distant</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.430" end="00:16:59.870" style="s2">atomized individualized neoliberal etc</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.340" end="00:17:02.390" style="s2">etc there&#39;s like a way of being that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.870" end="00:17:04.070" style="s2">was raised in that me and a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.390" end="00:17:06.080" style="s2">people don&#39;t want to be a part of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.070" end="00:17:07.580" style="s2">you would call it game a and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.080" end="00:17:09.620" style="s2">be in game B which requires a different</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.580" end="00:17:12.860" style="s2">way of relating to others where we&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.620" end="00:17:15.200" style="s2">longer having one person in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.860" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">everyone we&#39;re not trying to have these</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.200" end="00:17:19.340" style="s2">top-down relationships we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:21.050" style="s2">work together and with some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.340" end="00:17:23.060" style="s2">equality whatever that looks like we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.050" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">don&#39;t know and practice we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.060" end="00:17:27.650" style="s2">grow into this game be a wet way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:30.200" style="s2">being in the world and into my way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.650" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">thinking that requires us to change how</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.200" end="00:17:35.630" style="s2">we relate to other individuals so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.350" end="00:17:38.299" style="s2">it&#39;s a big learning process about how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.630" end="00:17:40.010" style="s2">we relate and and this the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.299" end="00:17:41.090" style="s2">emphasize this is because most of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.010" end="00:17:42.710" style="s2">people that I encounter that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.090" end="00:17:44.600" style="s2">interested in you know restarting</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.710" end="00:17:47.690" style="s2">civilization or something they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.600" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">come in from a perspective of most the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.690" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">ones that I know coming from it off we</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:52.250" style="s2">just had the right technology you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">like if we it would be a bit like Airbnb</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.250" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">in a bit like uber but it would be owned</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:57.470" style="s2">by the drivers and you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">this whole technological plan about how</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.470" end="00:18:01.400" style="s2">if we just had the right systems and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:03.650" style="s2">structures and agreements then then we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.400" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">have a new a new way of being or as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.650" end="00:18:07.460" style="s2">think it goes a layer underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.990" end="00:18:11.150" style="s2">technology into the culture into our</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.460" end="00:18:12.590" style="s2">psychology and so on so that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.150" end="00:18:14.809" style="s2">writing that I&#39;m doing on this topic is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.590" end="00:18:16.130" style="s2">a lot of it&#39;s quite touchy-feely</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.809" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">you know it&#39;s about intimacy and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.130" end="00:18:18.770" style="s2">vulnerability and connection and these</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:21.460" style="s2">sorts of things because that&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.770" end="00:18:24.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen is like it kind of required</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.460" end="00:18:27.080" style="s2">necessary prerequisite before you get to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.110" end="00:18:28.549" style="s2">the really great stuff of yeah having</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.080" end="00:18:31.190" style="s2">one of these shared brands and shared</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.549" end="00:18:33.799" style="s2">money and freedom and connection and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.190" end="00:18:35.539" style="s2">on so the layers that I articulated in</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.799" end="00:18:39.049" style="s2">the Metro solidarity proposal it starts</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.539" end="00:18:40.820" style="s2">with the self and and I found it useful</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.049" end="00:18:44.059" style="s2">to even think about the self as a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.820" end="00:18:45.830" style="s2">so there&#39;s a therapeutic modality called</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.059" end="00:18:47.480" style="s2">internal family systems which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.830" end="00:18:49.340" style="s2">know well I haven&#39;t studied well but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.480" end="00:18:51.110" style="s2">feel like I kind of independently</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.340" end="00:18:52.760" style="s2">started articulating some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.110" end="00:18:54.020" style="s2">that are in that and now I&#39;m rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.760" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">trying to catch up and learn because</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.020" end="00:18:57.650" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a lot more depth on it than</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:18:59.960" style="s2">I do but they treat the individual as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.650" end="00:19:02.659" style="s2">group and in a near language they call</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.960" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">them parts and so the idea is they you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.659" end="00:19:07.970" style="s2">know I have my confident part and my</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:09.409" style="s2">anxious part and my silly part and my</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.970" end="00:19:10.549" style="s2">happy part and you know all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.409" end="00:19:12.590" style="s2">different all these different characters</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.549" end="00:19:16.730" style="s2">that that live and have the shared</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:18.950" style="s2">custody of me and there&#39;s always work</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.730" end="00:19:21.230" style="s2">that I can do to bring those parts into</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.950" end="00:19:23.179" style="s2">greater harmony so for instance you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.230" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">for me one of the ways this is showed up</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.179" end="00:19:27.080" style="s2">simile really obviously in the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:29.059" style="s2">couple of weeks being here we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.080" end="00:19:30.140" style="s2">middle of a pandemic and I&#39;m a migrant</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.059" end="00:19:31.690" style="s2">in a country where I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.140" end="00:19:34.309" style="s2">place and I don&#39;t know the language I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.690" end="00:19:35.960" style="s2">some of my parts are very fearful you</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.309" end="00:19:37.120" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of anxiety and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.960" end="00:19:38.830" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.120" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">I&#39;m frightened about how things could go</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.830" end="00:19:42.370" style="s2">wrong and for the first couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">of that experience I was really trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.370" end="00:19:46.389" style="s2">to disarm that part of myself just</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:48.340" style="s2">ignore it just clamp down on it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.389" end="00:19:49.690" style="s2">look at it don&#39;t think about it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.340" end="00:19:50.740" style="s2">work you know it really didn&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.690" end="00:19:53.529" style="s2">put me in a state of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.740" end="00:19:54.340" style="s2">dissonance until I could just treat that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.529" end="00:19:57.610" style="s2">part of myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.340" end="00:20:00.730" style="s2">as a member of the family as a member of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.610" end="00:20:02.259" style="s2">the group you know over hey one part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.730" end="00:20:03.700" style="s2">me is fearful what does he need you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.259" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">if I can just treat him with some</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.700" end="00:20:07.509" style="s2">tenderness and respect maybe it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:09.879" style="s2">okay and so that&#39;s better practice which</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.509" end="00:20:12.549" style="s2">is about I guess deepening my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.879" end="00:20:14.619" style="s2">maturity and my own competence and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.549" end="00:20:16.779" style="s2">own ability to deal with you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.619" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">say in in the game game be space you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.779" end="00:20:19.299" style="s2">talk about sovereignty a lot I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:24.129" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of what that&#39;s about is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.299" end="00:20:26.139" style="s2">thank not being knowing what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.129" end="00:20:28.360" style="s2">Pats myself they get they get triggered</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.139" end="00:20:30.490" style="s2">or they get pulled into fantasizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.360" end="00:20:32.230" style="s2">ideas about how we&#39;re going to transform</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.490" end="00:20:34.210" style="s2">the world or they get freaked out about</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.230" end="00:20:35.289" style="s2">the wrong political idea or its lots of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.210" end="00:20:37.779" style="s2">different reasons that I lose my</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.289" end="00:20:39.549" style="s2">sovereignty and so I have a lot of focus</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.779" end="00:20:41.139" style="s2">on this thing about developing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.549" end="00:20:43.899" style="s2">relationship in the parts of your cells</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.139" end="00:20:45.279" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.899" end="00:20:47.769" style="s2">step up the ladder from there I call the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.279" end="00:20:49.720" style="s2">dyad and that&#39;s just it&#39;s just about two</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.769" end="00:20:52.570" style="s2">people two cells coming into contact</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.720" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">with each other and for argument&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.570" end="00:20:58.419" style="s2">I think it&#39;s useful to to borrow from</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:00.220" style="s2">Rihanna iyslah&#39;s work on what she calls</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.419" end="00:21:01.090" style="s2">the partnership domination lens and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.220" end="00:21:02.679" style="s2">she&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.090" end="00:21:05.799" style="s2">maybe you would be useful to read her</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.009" end="00:21:22.059" style="s2">named the partnership domination lens so</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.049" end="00:21:24.429" style="s2">are we relating to each other more as</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.059" end="00:21:26.679" style="s2">partners where we are two equally</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.429" end="00:21:28.149" style="s2">important about different people or are</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.029" end="00:21:38.259" style="s2">over the other and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.399" end="00:21:40.029" style="s2">really useful heuristic really useful</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.259" end="00:21:43.210" style="s2">lens for looking at all kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.649" end="00:21:48.190" style="s2">spiral is we&#39;re trying to learn how can</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.570" end="00:21:50.169" style="s2">we get a few hundred people together and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.190" end="00:21:50.410" style="s2">have them all relate to each other and</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.410" end="00:21:56.140" style="s2">partnership and and the reason that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.290" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">call out this dyad is because that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.430" end="00:22:28.150" style="s2">is just learn how to notice when you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.830" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">coming out of partnership into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.150" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">domination posture and see you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:35.470" style="s2">what you can do to to come back into</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.980" end="00:22:39.430" style="s2">partnership and I should also say you</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.470" end="00:22:40.510" style="s2">know domination is the is only half the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.430" end="00:22:42.010" style="s2">story because the other half is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.510" end="00:22:43.540" style="s2">submission right its domination and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.010" end="00:22:45.190" style="s2">Submission that&#39;s like two-player game</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.540" end="00:22:46.570" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t matter which side of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.190" end="00:22:48.370" style="s2">equation you&#39;re on there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.570" end="00:22:50.890" style="s2">maneuvers that you can take to get you</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.370" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">closer to partnership indeed sounds</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.890" end="00:22:54.060" style="s2">actually like you&#39;re describing a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:56.890" style="s2">marriage courses a dyadic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.060" end="00:22:58.990" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ve been fortunate to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.890" end="00:23:02.140" style="s2">been married 39 years to a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.990" end="00:23:04.930" style="s2">person and I think we&#39;ve always managed</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.140" end="00:23:07.420" style="s2">to see each other as complete peers</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.930" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">though different and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.420" end="00:23:12.310" style="s2">secret to making a dyad work and I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:14.560" style="s2">frankly fortunate and unlikely to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.310" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">had good parental model my working-class</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.560" end="00:23:19.000" style="s2">parents my dad dropped out of high</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:21.130" style="s2">school when it was after ninth grade my</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.000" end="00:23:22.300" style="s2">mother left home when she was 14 I grew</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.130" end="00:23:23.920" style="s2">up in a neighborhood where half the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.300" end="00:23:25.750" style="s2">adults had dropped out of high school so</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.920" end="00:23:27.850" style="s2">this was not what you&#39;d call socially</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.750" end="00:23:30.460" style="s2">advanced but nonetheless my parents had</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.850" end="00:23:33.250" style="s2">a marriage of a complete peer dome which</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.460" end="00:23:36.180" style="s2">was very interesting I never saw them</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.250" end="00:23:39.070" style="s2">seriously argue I never saw them take a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.180" end="00:23:41.230" style="s2">serious decision other than by consensus</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.070" end="00:23:43.060" style="s2">and so I think that was you know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.230" end="00:23:44.950" style="s2">and their marriage lasted till the death</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.060" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">of my father 54 years I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.950" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">something like that so yeah your dyad</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">sounds to me like very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.790" end="00:23:53.590" style="s2">healthy long-term marriage yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:55.810" style="s2">it&#39;s also I&#39;m you know like a best</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.590" end="00:23:57.850" style="s2">friend or a mentor or a coach or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.810" end="00:24:00.430" style="s2">a lot of different places that these</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.850" end="00:24:02.350" style="s2">relationships come up so then the step</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.430" end="00:24:05.169" style="s2">up from there I call the crew</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.350" end="00:24:08.289" style="s2">and I chose that word because it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.169" end="00:24:10.990" style="s2">like the crew of a sailing ship where</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.289" end="00:24:12.160" style="s2">again you&#39;re all doing different you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.990" end="00:24:14.169" style="s2">know when you&#39;re sailing a boat you all</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.160" end="00:24:15.280" style="s2">have different roles and you play to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.169" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">those strengths and you achieve</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.280" end="00:24:19.000" style="s2">something as a whole that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">on your own and I I really focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.000" end="00:24:22.270" style="s2">smaller scale I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s up to eight</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">people but I kind of regret that I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.270" end="00:24:26.770" style="s2">it maybe even should be kept at six</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:28.900" style="s2">people I usually say it&#39;s the size of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.770" end="00:24:30.190" style="s2">the number of people you can get around</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.900" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">a dinner table and have one conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.190" end="00:24:36.280" style="s2">with and and that scale is really</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">important because you know what&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.280" end="00:24:40.690" style="s2">name Margaret Mead it&#39;s got this theory</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:42.039" style="s2">often overused quote about never never</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.690" end="00:24:44.260" style="s2">doubt the power of a small group to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.039" end="00:24:46.840" style="s2">change the world indeed it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.260" end="00:24:49.059" style="s2">thing that ever has we hear that quote</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.840" end="00:24:51.010" style="s2">quite frequently but I wonder if people</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.059" end="00:24:52.299" style="s2">really take it to heart that the only</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.010" end="00:24:53.740" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.299" end="00:24:56.289" style="s2">is a small group of committed citizens</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.740" end="00:24:57.789" style="s2">and therefore to me our job is to learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.289" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">how to be one of those small groups of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.789" end="00:25:01.210" style="s2">committed citizens I think that should</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:02.409" style="s2">be so for anyone that wants to do some</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.210" end="00:25:03.640" style="s2">kind of change in the world your first</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.409" end="00:25:04.900" style="s2">principle should be okay where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.640" end="00:25:07.000" style="s2">small group that I&#39;m going to work with</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.900" end="00:25:09.280" style="s2">and that means it&#39;s not just about me</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.000" end="00:25:10.659" style="s2">with my heroic ideas but it&#39;s there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.280" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">the little crew it&#39;s there it&#39;s the four</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.659" end="00:25:14.380" style="s2">or five of us that are really going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:16.870" style="s2">take on some serious work</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.380" end="00:25:19.659" style="s2">so you mentioned loomio that was my</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.870" end="00:25:23.110" style="s2">first crew I think where we started that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.659" end="00:25:24.070" style="s2">with six people and we raised I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.110" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">know we raised a couple of million</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.070" end="00:25:27.370" style="s2">dollars an ethical financing and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:28.600" style="s2">built a piece of technology that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:31.179" style="s2">used by a few hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.600" end="00:25:32.740" style="s2">and it&#39;s like I don&#39;t think it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.179" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">amazing change the world project but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.740" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">think it&#39;s made a useful contribution to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.350" style="s2">the world and it&#39;s definitely orders of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:39.940" style="s2">magnitude more of an impact than I could</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.350" end="00:25:41.230" style="s2">have ever had on my own you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.940" end="00:25:45.610" style="s2">this real sweet spot where you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.230" end="00:25:47.380" style="s2">achieve a lot with with a small talented</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.610" end="00:25:49.030" style="s2">group with people that all have skill</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.380" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">that they all have trust that they all</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.030" end="00:25:50.850" style="s2">know how to collaborate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:53.049" style="s2">and they&#39;ve all got different</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.850" end="00:25:54.610" style="s2">superpowers you can really just get a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.049" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">huge amount of work done in that group</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.610" end="00:26:00.100" style="s2">and the reason I focus on the small bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:01.870" style="s2">is because once you get beyond eight</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.100" end="00:26:04.030" style="s2">nineteen people you&#39;ve got to need a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.870" end="00:26:05.169" style="s2">whole bunch of architecture to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.030" end="00:26:07.210" style="s2">group together you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.169" end="00:26:08.809" style="s2">start making a lot of stuff explicit and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.210" end="00:26:11.010" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.809" end="00:26:12.660" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re given to the difficult staff</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.010" end="00:26:14.340" style="s2">of governance you know like you need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.660" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">have a lot of agreements about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.340" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">happening and conflict management</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.890" style="s2">systems and checks and balances and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:22.890" style="s2">these kind of things whereas if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.890" end="00:26:25.890" style="s2">doing it at the small scale you can move</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.890" end="00:26:27.530" style="s2">a lot on you can develop a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.890" end="00:26:30.510" style="s2">shared context with five or six people</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.530" end="00:26:32.340" style="s2">using not much more than dialogue you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.510" end="00:26:33.720" style="s2">know just having having a call once a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.340" end="00:26:35.370" style="s2">week or something where you sync up with</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.720" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">each other that can be enough of an</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.370" end="00:26:38.789" style="s2">organizational structure but once you go</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.429" style="s2">beyond that scale then you need to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.789" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">all this architecture in and there tends</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.429" end="00:26:45.240" style="s2">to tends towards inefficiency you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:47.669" style="s2">it tends towards drama tinsel as debate</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.240" end="00:26:50.940" style="s2">and so I&#39;m really focused on how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.669" end="00:26:53.250" style="s2">produce a world full of really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.940" end="00:26:54.900" style="s2">crews really excellent small groups of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.250" end="00:26:56.190" style="s2">people doing meaningful stuff supporting</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.900" end="00:26:58.710" style="s2">each other to play to their strengths</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.190" end="00:27:02.039" style="s2">and and and move the world in the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.710" end="00:27:05.340" style="s2">direction and so for most people getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.039" end="00:27:07.830" style="s2">into this that means you need a practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.340" end="00:27:08.730" style="s2">because because you&#39;re not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.830" end="00:27:10.980" style="s2">it right the first time</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.730" end="00:27:12.210" style="s2">you know your people are the first time</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.980" end="00:27:13.350" style="s2">that you bring a team together and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.210" end="00:27:15.780" style="s2">try and do your project you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.350" end="00:27:18.059" style="s2">going to fall out makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.780" end="00:27:19.530" style="s2">push back a little bit on the size range</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.059" end="00:27:21.179" style="s2">or maybe there&#39;s two different things</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.530" end="00:27:24.120" style="s2">here as you may know I was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.179" end="00:27:26.220" style="s2">entrepreneur in my early career started</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.120" end="00:27:28.470" style="s2">several companies and then later helped</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.220" end="00:27:31.140" style="s2">many other companies start so I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.470" end="00:27:33.900" style="s2">exposure to maybe 17 startup companies</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.140" end="00:27:37.159" style="s2">of which 13 or 14 ended up producing</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.900" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">positive results for their investors and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.159" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">the model I always used is that was 20</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:45.000" style="s2">that was the magic number in this size</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:47.010" style="s2">but I will say and I think about it here</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.000" end="00:27:49.620" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat different than your crew</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.010" end="00:27:52.110" style="s2">of three to six because three to six</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.620" end="00:27:55.049" style="s2">would correspond to the loose groups</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.110" end="00:27:56.760" style="s2">within the 20 and you know I still</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.049" end="00:27:59.850" style="s2">remember a couple of my startups where</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.760" end="00:28:01.950" style="s2">we&#39;d have yes we had a tech team and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.850" end="00:28:03.929" style="s2">had a sales team and we had a marketing</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.950" end="00:28:06.299" style="s2">team say the customer service team he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.929" end="00:28:07.770" style="s2">had a few people in it but yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.299" end="00:28:09.450" style="s2">was a nominal head but the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.770" end="00:28:11.190" style="s2">matter was we ran the company around the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.450" end="00:28:12.600" style="s2">lunch table you know every day we got</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.190" end="00:28:15.419" style="s2">together for lunch and it could be up to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.600" end="00:28:18.510" style="s2">20 people on a big table and we somehow</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.419" end="00:28:20.340" style="s2">managed to run it to 15 or 20 around the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.510" end="00:28:21.250" style="s2">table even though we were sort of past 6</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.340" end="00:28:23.410" style="s2">or so which is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.250" end="00:28:26.920" style="s2">number we were you know loosely grouped</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.410" end="00:28:28.180" style="s2">into nominal teams with nominal heads so</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.920" end="00:28:30.190" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s something in between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.180" end="00:28:32.380" style="s2">crew and then your next level up which</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.190" end="00:28:34.390" style="s2">is sort of 6 to 20 we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.380" end="00:28:36.400" style="s2">at least yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.390" end="00:28:38.110" style="s2">I think this is a really important piece</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.400" end="00:28:40.660" style="s2">here where you say these nominal heads</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.110" end="00:28:43.960" style="s2">I&#39;m guessing that that most of all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.660" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">these startups they did have some degree</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.960" end="00:28:47.920" style="s2">of centralized ownership and leadership</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really familiar</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.920" end="00:28:51.400" style="s2">model that we know and so I think in</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:52.780" style="s2">some contexts people are just more</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.400" end="00:28:55.240" style="s2">familiar with that way of working and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.780" end="00:28:56.250" style="s2">you can go further whereas if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.240" end="00:28:59.020" style="s2">trying to do something where you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.250" end="00:29:01.810" style="s2">completely decentralized ownership or</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.020" end="00:29:03.340" style="s2">decentralized leadership it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.810" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">experimental when people don&#39;t have such</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.340" end="00:29:06.430" style="s2">clear models of how to behave and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:07.900" style="s2">that&#39;s why I focus on the smaller scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.430" end="00:29:09.580" style="s2">where people get to practice if you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.900" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">20 people and you&#39;re trying to organize</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.580" end="00:29:13.750" style="s2">without a central point where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:15.370" style="s2">one person who owns this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.750" end="00:29:17.170" style="s2">three co-founders in the middle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.370" end="00:29:19.030" style="s2">good you&#39;re going to spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.170" end="00:29:21.970" style="s2">in debates about what our structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.030" end="00:29:23.950" style="s2">should be yeah maybe maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.970" end="00:29:26.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know we managed to do it even</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.950" end="00:29:29.110" style="s2">though we were game a we had you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.920" end="00:29:30.730" style="s2">stock and investors and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.110" end="00:29:33.130" style="s2">was concentrated ownership upwards</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.730" end="00:29:34.990" style="s2">towards the earliest senior players but</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.130" end="00:29:36.970" style="s2">everybody had stock in the company but</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.990" end="00:29:38.920" style="s2">it&#39;s always been one of my rules you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.970" end="00:29:41.860" style="s2">know even the receptionist has stock in</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.920" end="00:29:45.190" style="s2">the company from day one right and well</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.860" end="00:29:46.180" style="s2">I think we acted as if in general and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.190" end="00:29:48.430" style="s2">then this has always been one of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.180" end="00:29:50.890" style="s2">business rules radical intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.430" end="00:29:52.810" style="s2">honesty that anyone who could say</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.890" end="00:29:55.150" style="s2">something useful and intelligent had</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.810" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">exactly the same standing as anybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.150" end="00:30:03.790" style="s2">else yeah I&#39;m thinking about the context</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:06.130" style="s2">of say you get into a difficult deadlock</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.790" end="00:30:08.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a conflict there&#39;s probably one</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.130" end="00:30:09.250" style="s2">or two people in that group of 20 that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.020" end="00:30:11.680" style="s2">everyone is going to look to to solve</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.250" end="00:30:13.210" style="s2">that conflict yeah better it&#39;s true like</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.680" end="00:30:15.730" style="s2">those those concentrations in power</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.210" end="00:30:17.850" style="s2">they&#39;re always there yep even in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.730" end="00:30:20.920" style="s2">apiculture we know right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.850" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">one of my favorite yes on the show a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.920" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:26.920" style="s2">Jessica flack she&#39;s written a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:29.590" style="s2">policing in apiculture z-- and to some</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.920" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">degree monkey cultures and yep there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.590" end="00:30:33.910" style="s2">always somebody who when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:35.020" style="s2">deadlock figures things out but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.910" end="00:30:36.130" style="s2">that&#39;s emergent</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.020" end="00:30:37.150" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t have to be the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.130" end="00:30:39.670" style="s2">person if you go back and look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.150" end="00:30:42.220" style="s2">hunter-gatherer governance very very</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.670" end="00:30:44.410" style="s2">good book called hierarchy in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.220" end="00:30:46.600" style="s2">by Chris Boehm it actually should have</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.410" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">been called anti hierarchy in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.600" end="00:30:49.720" style="s2">because it talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">hunter-gatherer people kept formal</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.720" end="00:30:54.660" style="s2">hierarchies from forming and they had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.380" style="s2">concept called role based management</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.660" end="00:30:57.970" style="s2">obviously they didn&#39;t have management</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.380" end="00:30:58.660" style="s2">consultants to give a nice fancy name</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.970" end="00:31:01.180" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.660" end="00:31:03.280" style="s2">I don&#39;t think but in reality that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.180" end="00:31:06.400" style="s2">they practice which is they sort of knew</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.280" end="00:31:09.010" style="s2">who to look to for what so maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.400" end="00:31:12.160" style="s2">a good for hunting questions and it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.010" end="00:31:15.910" style="s2">ma for gathering questions and it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.160" end="00:31:18.130" style="s2">zou for weaving questions and if there</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.910" end="00:31:20.160" style="s2">was a deadlock amongst the community</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.130" end="00:31:22.690" style="s2">about one of those three domains</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.160" end="00:31:25.000" style="s2">everybody quote/unquote knew that these</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.690" end="00:31:27.460" style="s2">were the best thinkers on those three</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.000" end="00:31:29.050" style="s2">topics and so the the role based leader</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.460" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">would typically step forward in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.050" end="00:31:34.510" style="s2">domain and break the deadlock yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:35.890" style="s2">totally buy that model with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.510" end="00:31:38.050" style="s2">sometimes we call that a competency</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.890" end="00:31:40.090" style="s2">network you know where and the joy of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.050" end="00:31:42.190" style="s2">that network is that there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.090" end="00:31:44.350" style="s2">rough consensus about who is the best at</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.190" end="00:31:45.670" style="s2">weaving but it&#39;s not a sort of formal</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.350" end="00:31:47.290" style="s2">consensus you can actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.670" end="00:31:48.850" style="s2">overlap everyone has their own terrain</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.290" end="00:31:50.350" style="s2">of who they trust on which topic and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.850" end="00:31:51.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of there&#39;s a bit of wiggle</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.350" end="00:31:53.230" style="s2">room in that terrain and a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.730" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">messiness which is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.230" end="00:31:57.550" style="s2">resilient and really productive and as</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:58.990" style="s2">opposed to when you have the formal</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.550" end="00:32:00.550" style="s2">structure where you have departments and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.990" end="00:32:01.900" style="s2">everything&#39;s very clearly you know this</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.550" end="00:32:03.220" style="s2">is the person that you report to and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.900" end="00:32:05.320" style="s2">this person is the smartest one on this</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.220" end="00:32:06.700" style="s2">topic thank if you can organize as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.320" end="00:32:08.890" style="s2">network you&#39;re much more resilient and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.700" end="00:32:11.140" style="s2">efficient I think exactly so it turns</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.890" end="00:32:12.910" style="s2">out Lulu who was the expert on weaving</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.140" end="00:32:14.530" style="s2">is starting to lose it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.910" end="00:32:17.890" style="s2">maybe she&#39;s drinking too heavy but her</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.530" end="00:32:19.870" style="s2">younger cousin Lala is gradually arising</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.890" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">as the most knowledgeable weaver then</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.870" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">Lulu gradually loses her authority to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:27.160" style="s2">Lele in a way that&#39;s not brittle right</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:28.900" style="s2">that you would see in a game a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.160" end="00:32:30.970" style="s2">organization I&#39;ll give you a real world</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.900" end="00:32:33.190" style="s2">example in my own companies you know I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.970" end="00:32:35.860" style="s2">might have been the CEO or the CEO or</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.190" end="00:32:36.970" style="s2">the founder CTO I had all kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.970" end="00:32:43.240" style="s2">but I would always make sure that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.880" end="00:32:45.160" style="s2">would announce loudly is don&#39;t expect me</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.240" end="00:32:47.110" style="s2">to ever make a decision about anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.160" end="00:32:48.669" style="s2">that has to do with aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.110" end="00:32:50.639" style="s2">I have knowest</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.669" end="00:32:53.980" style="s2">makes sense at all my aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.639" end="00:32:56.529" style="s2">construction crayon on grocery bag so</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.980" end="00:32:58.809" style="s2">don&#39;t ever ask me my opinion about which</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.529" end="00:33:00.850" style="s2">logo is better or what color we should</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.809" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">have for our letterhead I am entirely</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.850" end="00:33:04.659" style="s2">incompetent in fact I have anti</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.659" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">certainly wrong something tells me</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.909" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not a false humility I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:13.779" style="s2">for you antigen nope it&#39;s not I am just</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.549" style="s2">in confident you also me draw they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.779" end="00:33:17.230" style="s2">all like if I asked me to draw a person</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.549" end="00:33:19.299" style="s2">it looks like about a rather untalented</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.230" end="00:33:21.100" style="s2">five-year-old so I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.299" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">pronouncement of that sort provided room</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.100" end="00:33:26.590" style="s2">for role-based competency to arise the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:28.059" style="s2">so this does sort of illustrate why I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.809" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">the next and and like you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.970" end="00:34:22.419" style="s2">name this this level of six to twenty</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:24.040" style="s2">people I&#39;m sure they&#39;re out there are</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.869" end="00:34:30.190" style="s2">I call the congregation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.329" end="00:34:33.010" style="s2">basically a Dunbar number you know more</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.190" end="00:34:34.419" style="s2">or less and I think the jury&#39;s still out</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.010" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">on what them at Dunbar number actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.419" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">is because it&#39;s so culturally dependent</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:41.260" style="s2">so context dependent but in any case it</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:42.490" style="s2">might be a hundred people in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.260" end="00:34:44.260" style="s2">and it might be two or three hundred in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.490" end="00:34:45.609" style="s2">others but it&#39;s that it&#39;s the number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.260" end="00:34:47.139" style="s2">people that you can have who basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.609" end="00:34:48.520" style="s2">know each other you know where you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.139" end="00:34:50.710" style="s2">basically assume that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.520" end="00:34:51.970" style="s2">strangers and then if a stranger shows</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.710" end="00:34:53.290" style="s2">up everyone will be able to spot them</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.970" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">right away because it&#39;s there huh we</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.290" end="00:34:56.919" style="s2">don&#39;t know you I mean the reason I call</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:34:59.550" style="s2">it a congregation partly it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.919" end="00:35:01.260" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because it sounds churchy</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.550" end="00:35:03.690" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got this churchy background</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.260" end="00:35:05.010" style="s2">that I&#39;m a excommunicated from a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.690" end="00:35:07.080" style="s2">fundamentalist church so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.010" end="00:35:08.760" style="s2">funny for me to use that word but also</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.080" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">it&#39;s because the main job of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.760" end="00:35:12.510" style="s2">congregation is to congregate it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:14.610" style="s2">verb it&#39;s about the gathering it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.510" end="00:35:17.640" style="s2">their coming together and so in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.610" end="00:35:21.000" style="s2">spirals case the congregation is about</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.640" end="00:35:22.980" style="s2">200 people and we get together once a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.000" end="00:35:24.630" style="s2">year and not everyone can get there but</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.980" end="00:35:26.280" style="s2">like a critical mass of people will come</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.630" end="00:35:30.180" style="s2">to a gathering once a year for about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.280" end="00:35:31.740" style="s2">week and in that time it&#39;s it functions</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.180" end="00:35:34.740" style="s2">like a dating pool for all the crews</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.740" end="00:35:36.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the space where you get to meet new</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.740" end="00:35:37.230" style="s2">collaborators you get to update each</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.120" end="00:35:39.000" style="s2">other on the projects that you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.230" end="00:35:40.500" style="s2">you know you might be sitting around the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.000" end="00:35:42.210" style="s2">campfire late at night and exchanging</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.500" end="00:35:45.390" style="s2">stories about near-misses you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.210" end="00:35:47.820" style="s2">experienced in your crew and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.390" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">lot of mingling there you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.820" end="00:35:50.700" style="s2">about all the crews kind of blending</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:52.410" style="s2">together for a while and developing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.700" end="00:35:53.820" style="s2">sense of there&#39;s something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.410" end="00:35:55.590" style="s2">something bigger than just my little</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.820" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">startup which is focused on you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.590" end="00:35:59.310" style="s2">like loomio this decision-making towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:01.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s nice on its own but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.310" end="00:36:02.790" style="s2">much more compelling to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.500" end="00:36:03.870" style="s2">connected to this bigger thing where</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.790" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like are there&#39;s thirty different</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.870" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">ventures all doing different related</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:10.230" style="s2">projects that that gives me an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.180" style="s2">sense of pride you know and belonging</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.230" end="00:36:15.390" style="s2">and it&#39;s really encouraging to be in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.180" end="00:36:17.400" style="s2">their in their network and again the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.390" end="00:36:19.950" style="s2">congregation of say 150 people if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.400" end="00:36:21.450" style="s2">want to choose an average is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.950" end="00:36:23.130" style="s2">smaller than most of the groups that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.450" end="00:36:25.500" style="s2">people are working in you know like so</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.130" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">if you think about Burning Man and all</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.500" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">those related participatory community</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:32.010" style="s2">slash festivals that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.780" end="00:36:32.610" style="s2">around the world that people get really</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.010" end="00:36:34.110" style="s2">excited about</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.610" end="00:36:37.230" style="s2">they usually have thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.110" end="00:36:39.120" style="s2">thousands of people in them and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.230" end="00:36:40.860" style="s2">good for a short time to do that but and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.120" end="00:36:42.120" style="s2">people go to those things because they</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.860" end="00:36:44.790" style="s2">feel like they belong they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.120" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2">they&#39;ve found the others but the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.790" end="00:36:48.900" style="s2">like a group of that scale most of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.820" end="00:36:50.670" style="s2">people are going to be anonymous to each</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.900" end="00:36:52.050" style="s2">other they might have an imagined</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.670" end="00:36:53.580" style="s2">community where they sense like ah</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.050" end="00:36:55.560" style="s2">you&#39;re one of those people and I&#39;m one</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.580" end="00:36:57.480" style="s2">of those people but if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.560" end="00:36:59.010" style="s2">in a group that&#39;s larger than 150 people</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.480" end="00:37:00.510" style="s2">you can&#39;t actually count on anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.010" end="00:37:04.200" style="s2">know you and you can&#39;t count on anyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:06.030" style="s2">to to actually care about you when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.200" end="00:37:07.620" style="s2">get sick say or like when you have some</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.030" end="00:37:09.000" style="s2">real needs you can&#39;t really count on</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.620" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">those people to come through for you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.000" end="00:37:13.240" style="s2">so again it&#39;s like it&#39;s a smaller scale</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">than most people are used to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.240" end="00:37:17.410" style="s2">came out organizing it I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.730" end="00:37:18.670" style="s2">expand your concept of the congregation</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.410" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">a little bit this you know again comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.670" end="00:37:22.840" style="s2">from my own business career where we not</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:27.190" style="s2">you can think of the congregation not</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.840" end="00:37:28.710" style="s2">only as a dating service for Cruz but</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.190" end="00:37:30.700" style="s2">also there are some problems and some</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.710" end="00:37:32.770" style="s2">opportunities that take a lot more than</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.700" end="00:37:34.570" style="s2">a crew to solve right there are some</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.770" end="00:37:36.970" style="s2">businesses you just can&#39;t build without</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.570" end="00:37:39.340" style="s2">under two hundred three hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.970" end="00:37:41.590" style="s2">and was something we discovered at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.340" end="00:37:43.420" style="s2">Thompson corporation big a billion</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.590" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">dollar at the time multinational but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.420" end="00:37:47.830" style="s2">worked there in the 90s now Thomson</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:49.600" style="s2">Reuters and we tried hard couldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.830" end="00:37:52.030" style="s2">in all of our businesses but in many of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.600" end="00:37:55.300" style="s2">our businesses we had identified a size</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.030" end="00:37:57.910" style="s2">of about 300 that is the most people we</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.300" end="00:37:59.560" style="s2">wanted to have at one facility and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.910" end="00:38:01.690" style="s2">even if a business unit itself was</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.560" end="00:38:03.790" style="s2">bigger than that we tried to you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.690" end="00:38:06.670" style="s2">not have more than 300 of them at one</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.790" end="00:38:08.470" style="s2">street address and those 300 people</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.670" end="00:38:09.910" style="s2">acted together as a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.470" end="00:38:11.770" style="s2">congregation you know they had their</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.910" end="00:38:13.930" style="s2">Christmas party together they had you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.770" end="00:38:16.030" style="s2">know they&#39;d order pizzas they&#39;d have you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.930" end="00:38:18.550" style="s2">know quarterly addresses from whoever</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.030" end="00:38:20.770" style="s2">the leader of that congregation was if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.550" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">jokingly my wife helped me with this we</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.770" end="00:38:26.280" style="s2">jokingly named all the ranks in Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:28.390" style="s2">from Pope on down right so you had</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.280" end="00:38:30.940" style="s2">Cardinals and Archbishop&#39;s and bishops</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.390" end="00:38:32.859" style="s2">and Monsignors and priests and deacons</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.940" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">and all this sort of stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.859" end="00:38:36.690" style="s2">typically a group of 300 would have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">about the equivalent of a bishop and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.690" end="00:38:41.710" style="s2">there would be you know four or five</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:43.690" style="s2">priests below that with groups around</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.710" end="00:38:46.060" style="s2">100 between fifty and a hundred so the</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:53.080" style="s2">context of a relatively highly networked</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.609" end="00:39:04.630" style="s2">world we talk about a group called a</p>

<p begin="00:39:04.630" end="00:39:09.850" style="s2">between 100 and 300 with a mean maybe of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.390" end="00:39:11.140" style="s2">150 that might be responsible for a</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.140" end="00:39:16.930" style="s2">housing making sure that nobody in a</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.930" end="00:39:21.130" style="s2">any circumstance which means if you vote</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.970" end="00:39:23.109" style="s2">somebody into your Dunbar and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.130" end="00:39:24.609" style="s2">somehow lose their home they&#39;re gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.609" end="00:39:26.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a commitment we make at the level</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.890" end="00:39:30.130" style="s2">it seems to me an appropriate commitment</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.690" end="00:39:31.750" style="s2">to make it that level so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.130" end="00:39:33.460" style="s2">just a ruddy an expansion of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.750" end="00:39:35.349" style="s2">concept which i think is you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.460" end="00:39:36.519" style="s2">of bang on and I think we&#39;ve all you</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.349" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">know learned a little bit from Robin</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.519" end="00:39:42.250" style="s2">think 150 is a magic number but</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.140" end="00:39:44.890" style="s2">something in that range</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.250" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">is saying something important so now</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.890" end="00:39:48.549" style="s2">beyond the congregation what do we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:51.069" style="s2">well beyond that I just call it the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.549" end="00:39:53.079" style="s2">crown because the point is once you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.069" end="00:39:55.329" style="s2">beyond that scale you have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.079" end="00:39:56.950" style="s2">expectation of anonymity and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.329" end="00:39:58.779" style="s2">matter if it&#39;s 500 or if it&#39;s 5 million</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.710" end="00:40:04.390" style="s2">context and and I&#39;ve just decided not to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.410" end="00:40:07.319" style="s2">have too many opinions at that scale</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.390" end="00:40:10.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s people that are really</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.319" end="00:40:11.230" style="s2">motivated about this you know how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.180" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">going to change the world or how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.230" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">going to change this country or you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.700" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">thinking in terms of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:18.460" style="s2">at once and I&#39;m happy to leave them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:19.869" style="s2">it and I&#39;m much more interested in how</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.460" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">do we develop relationships of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.869" end="00:40:26.890" style="s2">excellence at a scale that&#39;s yeah Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:28.539" style="s2">or lower and that&#39;s my area yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.890" end="00:40:30.190" style="s2">agree if we don&#39;t solve the lower</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.539" end="00:40:32.619" style="s2">problems we won&#39;t solve the higher</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.190" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">problems correctly though we do have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.619" end="00:40:39.339" style="s2">concept in game be called proto B which</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:43.269" style="s2">is you know 2 to n Dunbar&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.339" end="00:40:46.210" style="s2">collectively or by affiliation agree to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.269" end="00:40:47.559" style="s2">a certain set of principles and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.210" end="00:40:49.269" style="s2">proto B&#39;s can have different sets of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.559" end="00:40:51.460" style="s2">principles and the principle set should</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.269" end="00:40:53.589" style="s2">be small enough to allow considerable</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.460" end="00:40:56.259" style="s2">diversity amongst Dunbar&#39;s what we call</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.589" end="00:40:58.539" style="s2">coherent pluralism you know so proto B</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.259" end="00:41:00.609" style="s2">might have here are our nine principles</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.539" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">right if you want to be a Dunbar in</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.609" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">proto B cactus then you should include</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:10.210" style="s2">in your principles this set as a core</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">and there should be competing proto B&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.210" end="00:41:13.299" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the ways we think</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:15.910" style="s2">of getting to a somewhat higher number</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.299" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">aggregate around coherent pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.910" end="00:41:20.470" style="s2">using multiple Dunbar&#39;s and let the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:22.839" style="s2">proto B&#39;s differ in how they choose what</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.470" end="00:41:24.519" style="s2">their coherent core should be whether</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.839" end="00:41:25.869" style="s2">that works are not oh no it&#39;s all theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.519" end="00:41:28.359" style="s2">at this point a lot of it&#39;s written up</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.869" end="00:41:30.910" style="s2">in my paper a journey to game be</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.359" end="00:41:33.250" style="s2">available on medium but I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.910" end="00:41:35.019" style="s2">less confident about that level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.250" end="00:41:37.450" style="s2">organization than I am some of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.019" end="00:41:41.109" style="s2">lower levels we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:42.760" style="s2">I&#39;m writing a related hypothesis but</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.109" end="00:41:44.200" style="s2">it&#39;s different and it&#39;s I think useful</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.760" end="00:41:46.359" style="s2">to name it just to see how it plays out</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:49.450" style="s2">which is you&#39;re talking about principles</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.359" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to see how far we can get</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.450" end="00:41:53.290" style="s2">without naming principles without naming</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">purpose without naming values and just</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.290" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">they explicitly focused on that on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.780" style="s2">practices they could keep it really</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:00.220" style="s2">close to the verbs to the action to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.780" end="00:42:02.290" style="s2">doing like what are the methodologies we</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.220" end="00:42:04.930" style="s2">use what is the stuff that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.290" end="00:42:06.790" style="s2">see how far we can go without naming</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.930" end="00:42:09.430" style="s2">these abstractions these nouns these</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.790" end="00:42:10.839" style="s2">principles these purposes because that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.430" end="00:42:13.930" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a reaction potentially an</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.839" end="00:42:15.910" style="s2">overreaction from me to seeing first of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.930" end="00:42:18.820" style="s2">all how much time groups put into</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.910" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">articulating these nice attractions but</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.820" end="00:42:24.310" style="s2">secondly how there&#39;s always a large gap</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:26.440" style="s2">between the stated principles that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.310" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">all agreed to and the actual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.440" end="00:42:29.619" style="s2">that you see and so I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:31.240" style="s2">experiment of just like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.619" end="00:42:33.160" style="s2">explicitly focused on the behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.240" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">and try and keep it as concrete as</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.160" end="00:42:37.420" style="s2">possible and and leave the abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:39.010" style="s2">to manage themselves mmm I&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.420" end="00:42:41.829" style="s2">open that by the way I will fully</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.010" end="00:42:44.829" style="s2">confess that I am an old fart with lots</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.829" end="00:42:46.990" style="s2">of game a heritage and malware and so my</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.829" end="00:42:50.230" style="s2">own use of the word principles should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.990" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">taken as somewhat atavistic and if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.230" end="00:42:53.980" style="s2">can get away without them so much the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.690" style="s2">better but I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.980" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">see it but I&#39;m certainly open to it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.690" end="00:42:59.890" style="s2">I do like principles that the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.619" style="s2">Ray Dalio uses them you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.890" end="00:43:04.420" style="s2">thank what category of scenario are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.619" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">in in this moment have we seen this type</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.420" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2">of scenario before and what did we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:08.619" style="s2">last time</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:10.270" style="s2">Becky&#39;s got a very coherent framework</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.619" end="00:43:12.520" style="s2">for thinking about decision-making and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.270" end="00:43:13.780" style="s2">thinking about how to respond to novelty</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.520" end="00:43:15.970" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.780" end="00:43:18.819" style="s2">useful but the use of the principles as</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.970" end="00:43:22.150" style="s2">in like we love transparency and honesty</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.819" end="00:43:24.069" style="s2">and inclusion it&#39;s thank give me a break</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.150" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s fitting that I found that</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.900" end="00:43:33.670" style="s2">right and we actually point to it you</p>

<p begin="00:43:41.710" end="00:43:45.490" style="s2">have found that one principle in</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.930" end="00:43:47.349" style="s2">particular to be extraordinarily useful</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.490" end="00:43:50.830" style="s2">the other one was our Thompson principle</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.830" end="00:43:55.840" style="s2">should push responsibility down as far</p>

<p begin="00:43:58.660" end="00:44:03.400" style="s2">there was of course lots of hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.210" end="00:44:05.530" style="s2">about that because humans love to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.400" end="00:44:07.450" style="s2">aggregate power but we would call that</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.620" end="00:44:27.070" style="s2">know trying to mobilize this</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.940" end="00:44:29.290" style="s2">historically print and cd-rom based</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.070" end="00:44:31.300" style="s2">publisher to move into the internet I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.290" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">said one huge competitive advantage we</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.300" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">have in this transition is we have in</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:38.830" style="s2">our company five hundred people allowed</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:40.870" style="s2">to waste fifty thousand dollars right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.830" end="00:44:42.550" style="s2">and I looked at my CFO while I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.870" end="00:44:46.210" style="s2">saying this it was up there on the stage</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.550" end="00:44:48.700" style="s2">with me and he winced uh but it was he</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.210" end="00:44:49.810" style="s2">was a great CEO but he agreed and I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.700" end="00:44:51.220" style="s2">you know our number-one competitor</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.810" end="00:44:53.740" style="s2">head-to-head competitor mcgraw-hill</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.220" end="00:44:57.040" style="s2">there&#39;s only three people allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.740" end="00:44:59.590" style="s2">waste $50,000 right and having 500</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.590" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">just make an arbitrary crazy decision on</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.930" end="00:45:07.870" style="s2">$50,000 will give us a huge advantage in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:11.020" style="s2">out evolving McGraw Hill and sure enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.870" end="00:45:13.540" style="s2">we did so principles could be useful the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.020" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">sense that my kind of company yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.540" end="00:45:17.650" style="s2">was at those days unfortunately got a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.640" end="00:45:19.690" style="s2">new management team came over blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.650" end="00:45:21.400" style="s2">they it up oh well now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.690" end="00:45:24.040" style="s2">purely financial driven money on money</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.400" end="00:45:25.450" style="s2">return such as life but so those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.040" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">of principles they should be small</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.450" end="00:45:30.790" style="s2">number and they have to be really taken</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:33.730" style="s2">seriously right and yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.790" end="00:45:35.530" style="s2">hypocrisy is the price that virtue pays</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.730" end="00:45:37.120" style="s2">to vice or the other way around I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.530" end="00:45:39.220" style="s2"> it is but your people won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.120" end="00:45:40.300" style="s2">hundred percent compliant but if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.220" end="00:45:41.800" style="s2">taken seriously I think they could work</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.300" end="00:45:43.870" style="s2">but on the other hand I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.800" end="00:45:46.210" style="s2">see how your approach works I am like</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.870" end="00:45:49.260" style="s2">you know fully confessed to being highly</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.210" end="00:45:51.610" style="s2">over for more my game a experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.260" end="00:45:55.240" style="s2">listening for the younger generation to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.610" end="00:45:56.920" style="s2">prove me wrong by the right and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.240" end="00:45:58.540" style="s2">have to fully confess that I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.920" end="00:46:00.760" style="s2">extremist you know I always swing too</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.540" end="00:46:01.810" style="s2">far off the deep end so the right the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.760" end="00:46:02.150" style="s2">right way is probably somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.810" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">middle</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.150" end="00:46:06.950" style="s2">yeah and we&#39;ll figure it out over time</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:09.589" style="s2">so yeah thanks for a lot for that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.950" end="00:46:11.420" style="s2">hop back now a level that review of your</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.420" end="00:46:14.990" style="s2">various levels the other work actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.789" end="00:46:16.849" style="s2">when I read it was the reason I reached</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.990" end="00:46:19.519" style="s2">out to you to come on the show was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.849" end="00:46:21.890" style="s2">very interesting higher level medium</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.519" end="00:46:25.069" style="s2">article called how to weave social</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.890" end="00:46:27.289" style="s2">fabric and it calls out and links to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.069" end="00:46:29.990" style="s2">micro Sol parity series but it curve</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.289" end="00:46:31.700" style="s2">operates at a higher and maybe simpler</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.990" end="00:46:33.650" style="s2">level for people to get started with</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.700" end="00:46:36.230" style="s2">where you talk about initiators</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.650" end="00:46:38.390" style="s2">gatherings and crews maybe want to do a</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.230" end="00:46:43.009" style="s2">quick run-through on how to weave social</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.390" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">fabric hmm this is um this is funny</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.009" end="00:46:48.499" style="s2">because I wrote that in January with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:50.809" style="s2">plan for how we were initiating a couple</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.499" end="00:46:53.210" style="s2">of different congregations so one was</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.809" end="00:46:55.190" style="s2">about taking the Inspiral congregation</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.210" end="00:46:57.079" style="s2">which I said is centered in Wellington</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.190" end="00:46:59.210" style="s2">in New Zealand and seeing if we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.079" end="00:47:00.970" style="s2">establish a sort of cell division there</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.210" end="00:47:03.710" style="s2">you know establish a new core in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.970" end="00:47:06.619" style="s2">somewhere in Europe so there&#39;s that kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.710" end="00:47:08.029" style="s2">of budding new congregation and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.619" end="00:47:09.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of others that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.029" end="00:47:13.430" style="s2">involved with different ways one of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.829" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">is a group for Community Builder type</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.430" end="00:47:17.869" style="s2">facilitator type people and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:19.970" style="s2">another one which is a network basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.869" end="00:47:22.180" style="s2">of political leaders and activists and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.970" end="00:47:24.259" style="s2">so on so there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.180" end="00:47:27.230" style="s2">congregations that I&#39;m helping to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.259" end="00:47:30.739" style="s2">establish and we wrote this in January</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.230" end="00:47:31.640" style="s2">and the plan was well the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.739" end="00:47:32.630" style="s2">you do is you have a really great</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.640" end="00:47:33.559" style="s2">gathering you have a really awesome</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.630" end="00:47:34.789" style="s2">meeting where you get everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.559" end="00:47:37.579" style="s2">face-to-face for the three or four days</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.789" end="00:47:38.660" style="s2">and you kind of you know you make them</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.579" end="00:47:40.369" style="s2">fall in love with each other and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.660" end="00:47:42.769" style="s2">you fill them with a vision and they go</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.369" end="00:47:46.249" style="s2">off and do a lot of stuff but then of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.769" end="00:47:48.410" style="s2">course the pandemic kept cuts in and our</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.249" end="00:47:51.499" style="s2">plans of having everyone face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.410" end="00:47:52.789" style="s2">are up in the air you know like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.499" end="00:47:57.859" style="s2">know about travel we don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.789" end="00:47:59.869" style="s2">gatherings so we are now in the re re</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.859" end="00:48:02.210" style="s2">hypothesizing re experimenting phase</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.869" end="00:48:04.039" style="s2">with can we can we we&#39;ve social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.210" end="00:48:07.489" style="s2">without having face-to-face time so this</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.039" end="00:48:08.839" style="s2">is really uncertain it&#39;s a puzzle we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.489" end="00:48:10.970" style="s2">doing a bunch of experimentation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.839" end="00:48:12.769" style="s2">I&#39;ll keep reporting what I learn along</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.970" end="00:48:14.239" style="s2">the way but still I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.769" end="00:48:15.230" style="s2">principles that I named in that blog</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.239" end="00:48:17.210" style="s2">post</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.230" end="00:48:20.329" style="s2">translate fairly well into a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.210" end="00:48:24.440" style="s2">context so the first one I named the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.329" end="00:48:26.180" style="s2">initiators so to think about who is who</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.440" end="00:48:27.710" style="s2">is gonna be in that role of calling</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.180" end="00:48:29.630" style="s2">people together you know who&#39;s gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.710" end="00:48:30.950" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna you know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.630" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">face-to-face gathering I&#39;m gonna book</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.950" end="00:48:34.460" style="s2">the venue and invite these people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:35.720" style="s2">come or if it&#39;s online similar who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.460" end="00:48:39.650" style="s2">gonna send out the calendar and like</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.720" end="00:48:41.930" style="s2">this is happening and I found it really</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.650" end="00:48:45.670" style="s2">useful to think of that within the frame</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.930" end="00:48:47.420" style="s2">of hospitality because hospitality has a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.670" end="00:48:49.160" style="s2">lot of people are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.420" end="00:48:50.450" style="s2">hospitality and the expectations in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.160" end="00:48:52.460" style="s2">roles that happen with the hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.450" end="00:48:54.470" style="s2">essentially being hosts and guests you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.460" end="00:48:57.170" style="s2">know that the host has some special</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.470" end="00:48:59.780" style="s2">responsibilities they have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.170" end="00:49:04.010" style="s2">empowered role there you know like we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.780" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">say my house my rules but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.010" end="00:49:08.210" style="s2">sense that the hosts job is to tend to</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:10.369" style="s2">the needs of the guests and to really</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.210" end="00:49:12.140" style="s2">give the guests a great experience so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.369" end="00:49:15.859" style="s2">find that a really useful frame for</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.140" end="00:49:17.869" style="s2">thinking about how to how to address</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.859" end="00:49:19.579" style="s2">leadership in this community building</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.869" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">context which is a quite a vexed</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.579" end="00:49:23.900" style="s2">question so I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:26.210" style="s2">essential that you have this this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.900" end="00:49:28.010" style="s2">host or co-hosts in the middle and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.210" end="00:49:30.020" style="s2">the first people that they call to them</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.010" end="00:49:33.349" style="s2">the ones that are closest to the core</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.020" end="00:49:34.339" style="s2">that you really think about what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.349" end="00:49:36.140" style="s2">qualities you want to see in your</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.339" end="00:49:37.730" style="s2">community and invite people they already</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.140" end="00:49:39.310" style="s2">exhibit some of those qualities you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.730" end="00:49:42.589" style="s2">people that you already think have</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.310" end="00:49:44.210" style="s2">wisdom or courage or they&#39;re very caring</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.589" end="00:49:45.619" style="s2">or very generous are very competent or</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.210" end="00:49:46.670" style="s2">whatever the qualities that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.619" end="00:49:52.369" style="s2">looking for like calling those people</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.670" end="00:49:57.290" style="s2">first and and yet giving that getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.369" end="00:49:58.609" style="s2">that smaller first stage core to some</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.290" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">degree of harmony some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.609" end="00:50:01.550" style="s2">coherence you know like bring them bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:04.250" style="s2">them together first maybe you&#39;ve got 10</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.550" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">people or 20 people first before leaping</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.250" end="00:50:07.400" style="s2">ahead to going let&#39;s get 100 people in</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:10.040" style="s2">the room or 300 people in the room did</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.400" end="00:50:12.589" style="s2">start with just establishing some sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.040" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">of a shared baseline like this is us</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.589" end="00:50:15.380" style="s2">this is what we do this is how we feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:18.589" style="s2">this is our direction that we&#39;re heading</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.380" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">in so then yeah then the blog posts they</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.589" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">go on to talk about how we run</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">gatherings at Inspiral and how I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:24.349" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.680" end="00:50:26.190" style="s2">the practice of our gathering is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.349" end="00:50:28.259" style="s2">absolutely essential to what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.190" end="00:50:30.599" style="s2">and this is the bit that have a super</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.259" end="00:50:32.970" style="s2">experimental when we don&#39;t know one way</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.599" end="00:50:34.410" style="s2">to think about it is the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.970" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">gathering will have this balance between</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.410" end="00:50:39.299" style="s2">freedom and form so I think people at</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:40.859" style="s2">least the kind of people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.299" end="00:50:43.140" style="s2">connecting with they don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.859" end="00:50:44.369" style="s2">a huge amount of structure and control</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.140" end="00:50:45.539" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.369" end="00:50:46.980" style="s2">going to go to a gathering and every</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.539" end="00:50:48.539" style="s2">hour is planned out and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.980" end="00:50:50.279" style="s2">agenda from start to finish there should</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.539" end="00:50:52.799" style="s2">be a lot of freedom for spontaneity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.279" end="00:50:53.730" style="s2">people to do whatever they want and lots</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.799" end="00:50:57.269" style="s2">of different things to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.730" end="00:51:00.150" style="s2">parallel and so on and other the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.269" end="00:51:01.499" style="s2">principle is to to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.150" end="00:51:03.180" style="s2">different relational spaces that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.499" end="00:51:04.799" style="s2">creating so there&#39;s one space which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.180" end="00:51:06.749" style="s2">the whole of us like the whole group</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.799" end="00:51:08.309" style="s2">when and if it&#39;s a small enough group</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.749" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">you can do that sitting in a circle you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.309" end="00:51:12.599" style="s2">know like am sometimes that and spiral</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:14.279" style="s2">will have a really deep kind of dialog</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.599" end="00:51:15.779" style="s2">circle or a story sharing circle where</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.279" end="00:51:17.190" style="s2">everyone&#39;s sitting in it in the room</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.779" end="00:51:19.890" style="s2">together looking at each other seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.190" end="00:51:21.539" style="s2">the whole of us and one at a time people</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.890" end="00:51:23.279" style="s2">share a story and everyone else is just</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.539" end="00:51:26.099" style="s2">going to listen so you cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.279" end="00:51:28.230" style="s2">sense of wholeness and then spend some</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.099" end="00:51:29.999" style="s2">time in the smaller groups so breaking</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.230" end="00:51:31.859" style="s2">off into crews so any gatherings that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.999" end="00:51:33.269" style="s2">run will always have usually we call</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.859" end="00:51:35.009" style="s2">them home groups for some reason but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.269" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">could call it a pod or whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.009" end="00:51:41.400" style="s2">to call it but just four or five people</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:42.779" style="s2">that are having some kind of repeated</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.400" end="00:51:45.930" style="s2">connection with each other throughout</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.779" end="00:51:48.749" style="s2">the course of their event and then we</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.930" end="00:51:50.249" style="s2">have the pairing so finding</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.749" end="00:51:52.099" style="s2">opportunities to put people face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.249" end="00:51:54.539" style="s2">you know sometimes would do things like</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.099" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">walk and talk so you pair up and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.539" end="00:51:57.720" style="s2">just you go for a walk for an hour and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">it&#39;s just the two of you going for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.720" end="00:52:00.660" style="s2">walk and talking and that might be might</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:02.489" style="s2">be as simple as that or you can do some</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.660" end="00:52:05.789" style="s2">more sort of intentional communication</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.489" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">practices about active listening and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.789" end="00:52:10.200" style="s2">speaking from a place of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:11.430" style="s2">and so on and and also I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.200" end="00:52:12.869" style="s2">helpful to make sure that there&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.430" end="00:52:14.339" style="s2">of time for people to spend time on</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.869" end="00:52:17.069" style="s2">their own you know which is like I said</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.339" end="00:52:18.599" style="s2">the smallest group itself the self and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.069" end="00:52:21.119" style="s2">the dyad because when I go to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.599" end="00:52:22.769" style="s2">conferences which I don&#39;t do anymore</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:25.319" style="s2">except there&#39;s a speaker but I used to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.769" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">go to conferences fairly often and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.319" end="00:52:29.039" style="s2">best parts for me were the one-on-ones</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:30.539" style="s2">right where you pick somebody out of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.039" end="00:52:32.309" style="s2">crowd or they pick you out of the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.539" end="00:52:34.049" style="s2">and you&#39;d go off to a corner during the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.309" end="00:52:37.110" style="s2">break and have some intensely deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.049" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">conversation right it&#39;s a truism</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.110" end="00:52:40.920" style="s2">you know poorly organized conferences</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:42.690" style="s2">essentially all the value is in the side</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.920" end="00:52:44.010" style="s2">conversations and for at least for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.690" end="00:52:46.650" style="s2">those are often dyadic</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.010" end="00:52:48.050" style="s2">so I would put that in there as well if</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.650" end="00:52:50.460" style="s2">one we&#39;re thinking about such things</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.050" end="00:52:52.470" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to something closer to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.460" end="00:52:54.360" style="s2">this podcast actually something you and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.470" end="00:52:56.760" style="s2">I have been chittering about on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.360" end="00:52:59.040" style="s2">a little bit and I&#39;m starting to do some</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.760" end="00:53:00.600" style="s2">work on and I think you and I and Jared</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.040" end="00:53:03.660" style="s2">are gonna have a conversation about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.600" end="00:53:06.690" style="s2">offline but we both been seeing Peter</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.660" end="00:53:10.680" style="s2">Limburg stoah which seems a nice example</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.690" end="00:53:12.540" style="s2">of building community around podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.680" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">and you know as I said we put together a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.540" end="00:53:16.500" style="s2">little project plan of our own it needs</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:19.470" style="s2">to be tuned and expanded what are some</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.500" end="00:53:21.170" style="s2">of your thoughts on how you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.470" end="00:53:24.360" style="s2">your principles can be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.170" end="00:53:26.040" style="s2">turning podcasts into essentially you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.360" end="00:53:28.230" style="s2">know expanded events that build</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.040" end="00:53:30.210" style="s2">community around them mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.230" end="00:53:32.130" style="s2">this is a really fun question because</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.210" end="00:53:34.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so live it&#39;s so emergent right</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.130" end="00:53:36.420" style="s2">now and four or five different</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.190" end="00:53:38.100" style="s2">conversations simultaneously all with</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.420" end="00:53:39.840" style="s2">people that are running podcasts asking</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.100" end="00:53:41.100" style="s2">how do they make them less about</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.840" end="00:53:43.950" style="s2">broadcast and more about peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.100" end="00:53:45.810" style="s2">community buildings so it&#39;s fun I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.950" end="00:53:46.860" style="s2">have a strong sense yet of what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.810" end="00:53:49.080" style="s2">right plan but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.860" end="00:53:53.310" style="s2">experiments happening in parallel one</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.080" end="00:53:55.710" style="s2">when piece of the puzzle I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.310" end="00:53:57.120" style="s2">there&#39;s an anti-pattern of podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.710" end="00:53:58.500" style="s2">especially in the game be space and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.120" end="00:54:01.290" style="s2">related sort of since making</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.500" end="00:54:05.610" style="s2">intellectual philosophical spaces which</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.290" end="00:54:07.710" style="s2">is I&#39;m concerned about an overdoing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.610" end="00:54:10.500" style="s2">intellect and an under doing the action</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.710" end="00:54:11.730" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s this all of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.500" end="00:54:13.170" style="s2">people that you interview on your show</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.730" end="00:54:15.240" style="s2">they&#39;re brilliant people you know and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.170" end="00:54:17.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like every time I can get a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.240" end="00:54:18.660" style="s2">episode of my favorite podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.490" end="00:54:21.090" style="s2">listen to this person you know wow</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.660" end="00:54:22.650" style="s2">they&#39;re so smart you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.090" end="00:54:23.970" style="s2">it&#39;s really stimulating to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.650" end="00:54:28.140" style="s2">these smart people that can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.970" end="00:54:29.820" style="s2">really clearly and the concern that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.140" end="00:54:32.490" style="s2">have is that people get into a habit of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.820" end="00:54:34.080" style="s2">just consuming knowledge just listening</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.490" end="00:54:36.090" style="s2">to more and more different people and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.080" end="00:54:38.190" style="s2">assembling this sort of like pristine</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.090" end="00:54:40.380" style="s2">map of how they think reality works and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.190" end="00:54:43.290" style="s2">maybe they start a little bit to think</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.380" end="00:54:44.970" style="s2">about how they might initiate some kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.290" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">of community or some project or</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.970" end="00:54:48.029" style="s2">something that they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:49.890" style="s2">but still they do this thing of like way</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.029" end="00:54:52.349" style="s2">over engineering at Nova thinking it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.890" end="00:54:55.949" style="s2">under practicing under experimenting and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.349" end="00:54:59.099" style="s2">so my energy is to try and interfere</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.949" end="00:55:01.079" style="s2">with that tendency and and push people</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.099" end="00:55:02.309" style="s2">more towards their agency more towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.079" end="00:55:06.059" style="s2">their initiative their entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.309" end="00:55:08.459" style="s2">their get up and do it kind of energy so</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.059" end="00:55:10.289" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing Peter Lim Berg&#39;s platform the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.459" end="00:55:12.089" style="s2">stoah is a really effective example of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.289" end="00:55:13.859" style="s2">someone who had a podcast and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.089" end="00:55:15.809" style="s2">doing everything interactive all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.859" end="00:55:17.130" style="s2">time and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.809" end="00:55:19.140" style="s2">brilliant and he&#39;s gonna be prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.130" end="00:55:22.229" style="s2">a lot of stuff yesterday I had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.140" end="00:55:24.749" style="s2">conversation with a podcast they had</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.229" end="00:55:26.729" style="s2">some really serious large audience</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.749" end="00:55:28.769" style="s2">they have many thousands of people that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.729" end="00:55:30.390" style="s2">very actively engaged already in some of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.769" end="00:55:32.670" style="s2">their community building efforts and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.390" end="00:55:35.219" style="s2">there they came to me with the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.670" end="00:55:36.719" style="s2">of you know we have these 5,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.219" end="00:55:39.439" style="s2">who are super engaged and now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.719" end="00:55:42.029" style="s2">asking about mutual aid funds like</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.439" end="00:55:44.219" style="s2">especially in the US you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.029" end="00:55:45.630" style="s2">who are certainly out of work or they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.219" end="00:55:47.459" style="s2">got these unexpected expenses with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.630" end="00:55:48.959" style="s2">pandemic and we want to support each</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.459" end="00:55:49.469" style="s2">other by sharing money around how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.959" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.469" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">and my instinctive answer is the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:57.390" style="s2">that I give to all these people is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:56:00.239" style="s2">you know like I keep saying focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.390" end="00:56:02.609" style="s2">small scale and also to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.239" end="00:56:04.829" style="s2">experimentation and learning so in their</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.609" end="00:56:06.749" style="s2">case it&#39;s like my recommendation is</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.829" end="00:56:08.579" style="s2">instead of trying to address your 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.749" end="00:56:10.709" style="s2">people is there a way that you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.579" end="00:56:13.529" style="s2">divide off a hundred or 300 or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.709" end="00:56:15.989" style="s2">like that and instead of designing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.529" end="00:56:17.579" style="s2">perfect system for a mutual aid fund</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.989" end="00:56:19.170" style="s2">where people can exchange money between</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.579" end="00:56:21.239" style="s2">each other tax-free or however it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.170" end="00:56:23.099" style="s2">going to work don&#39;t aim for perfection</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.239" end="00:56:24.420" style="s2">just aim for something that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.099" end="00:56:25.979" style="s2">teach you something you know that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.420" end="00:56:27.089" style="s2">of entrepreneurial attitude have just</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.979" end="00:56:29.880" style="s2">released something and then make it</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.089" end="00:56:31.679" style="s2">better next week and so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.880" end="00:56:33.719" style="s2">commended for them is that they run a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.679" end="00:56:34.859" style="s2">weekly or a two weekly cycle where okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.719" end="00:56:36.359" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do a funding round and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.859" end="00:56:37.349" style="s2">then at the end of that round we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.359" end="00:56:40.289" style="s2">going to stop and we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.349" end="00:56:42.209" style="s2">some kind of communal reflection process</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.289" end="00:56:43.859" style="s2">where we we go what was good about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.209" end="00:56:46.410" style="s2">what was not so good what are we going</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.859" end="00:56:49.170" style="s2">to do differently next time and use that</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.410" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">you know agile iterative learning</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.170" end="00:56:53.039" style="s2">process to just develop the structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:53.770" style="s2">that&#39;s right for the context that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.039" end="00:56:55.390" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.770" end="00:56:56.560" style="s2">because this is the thing like I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.390" end="00:56:58.090" style="s2">some degree of expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.560" end="00:56:59.530" style="s2">self-organizing groups but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.090" end="00:57:01.960" style="s2">any expertise in your context I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.530" end="00:57:03.130" style="s2">know who are the people and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.960" end="00:57:04.750" style="s2">relationships and what kind of culture</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.130" end="00:57:06.370" style="s2">they&#39;ve got and so the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.750" end="00:57:08.320" style="s2">organizational structure is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.370" end="00:57:10.030" style="s2">come from my ideas right it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.320" end="00:57:12.900" style="s2">emerge from the local context and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.030" end="00:57:15.910" style="s2">really instituting that practice of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.900" end="00:57:17.530" style="s2">being very rigorous around the learning</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.910" end="00:57:18.550" style="s2">and the experimentation like these are</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.530" end="00:57:20.020" style="s2">the experiments are running for this</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.550" end="00:57:21.310" style="s2">month and then this is the point where</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.020" end="00:57:23.290" style="s2">we stop and reflect and see what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.310" end="00:57:25.630" style="s2">to go better and yeah like I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.290" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">probably looking for opportunities to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.630" end="00:57:30.250" style="s2">focus on the small scale so in Peters</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:32.080" style="s2">case so they&#39;ve got one thing now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.250" end="00:57:34.780" style="s2">just started they call the the metagame</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.080" end="00:57:37.150" style="s2">mastermind and that&#39;s about it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.780" end="00:57:38.320" style="s2">little crew it&#39;s let&#39;s like find find</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.150" end="00:57:39.910" style="s2">three people that you&#39;re going to check</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.320" end="00:57:41.500" style="s2">in with every week on your personal</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.910" end="00:57:43.540" style="s2">development course I think that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.500" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">like an excellent initiative where they</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.540" end="00:57:49.660" style="s2">will have a shared sort of structure a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:52.360" style="s2">shared template like this is this is how</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.660" end="00:57:53.800" style="s2">we do our mastermind process and anyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.360" end="00:57:55.600" style="s2">can initiate so if you&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.800" end="00:57:56.770" style="s2">this and you like it then just call out</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.600" end="00:57:58.540" style="s2">the two or three of your friends and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.770" end="00:58:00.130" style="s2">here&#39;s their you know here&#39;s the run</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.540" end="00:58:01.720" style="s2">sheet if you want to try it out so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.130" end="00:58:03.430" style="s2">like the idea of having lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.720" end="00:58:05.110" style="s2">doing that very small gesture of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.430" end="00:58:06.460" style="s2">hospitality that one of saying hey I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.110" end="00:58:08.200" style="s2">want to do this little group thing do</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.460" end="00:58:09.580" style="s2">you want to do it with me and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.200" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">coalescing those small groups together</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.580" end="00:58:13.000" style="s2">into progressively larger groups and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:15.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know how that applies in your</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.000" end="00:58:18.340" style="s2">context with your with your incipient</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.550" end="00:58:19.750" style="s2">community that&#39;s about it&#39;s a certainly</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.340" end="00:58:21.880" style="s2">a question that will cause me to think</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.750" end="00:58:24.280" style="s2">alright I can&#39;t give you a good answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.880" end="00:58:25.330" style="s2">off the top of my head but I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.280" end="00:58:27.640" style="s2">that if I approach it from that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.330" end="00:58:30.370" style="s2">perspective that may help illuminate</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.640" end="00:58:32.290" style="s2">some good things to do I also like your</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.370" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">towards action in fact one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.290" end="00:58:37.210" style="s2">I call out is on the journey to game be</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:40.420" style="s2">is that we need to develop a bias</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.210" end="00:58:42.850" style="s2">towards action particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.420" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">social change movement we do seem to</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.850" end="00:58:48.010" style="s2">attract too many people who just love</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:51.370" style="s2">the talk right and people who do</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.010" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">not love to act and while talking is</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.370" end="00:58:55.660" style="s2">good and moves certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:57.340" style="s2">endeavors forward at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.660" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">you got to pull the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.340" end="00:59:01.960" style="s2">right you got to go out and do something</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">and so I strongly try to encourage a</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.960" end="00:59:05.410" style="s2">bias towards action one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.090" style="s2">recent things we&#39;ve done in the game B</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.410" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">space is you know the home</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.090" end="00:59:12.250" style="s2">game B Facebook group had gotten</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:15.070" style="s2">overstuffed with too much philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.250" end="00:59:16.780" style="s2"> and such and so we&#39;ve now spun</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.070" end="00:59:19.360" style="s2">off I don&#39;t know a dozen or more</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.780" end="00:59:21.670" style="s2">independent subgroups which have their</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.360" end="00:59:23.830" style="s2">own mod team which set their own rules</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.670" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">and are typically focused on a much more</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.830" end="00:59:30.910" style="s2">narrow topic like parenting or building</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:33.550" style="s2">sovereignty or education community</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.910" end="00:59:35.230" style="s2">building etc and even they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.550" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">somewhat talk shopping but some of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.230" end="00:59:39.700" style="s2">at least are moving towards action and</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:41.590" style="s2">you know I do think that you know those</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.700" end="00:59:43.360" style="s2">of us who are action oriented night I</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.590" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">see you as a person who&#39;s very action</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.360" end="00:59:48.630" style="s2">oriented you know need to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:51.250" style="s2">we kind of level up these radical change</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.630" end="00:59:54.370" style="s2">organisations away from being talk shops</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.250" end="00:59:55.570" style="s2">or navel-gazing and get on with building</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.370" end="00:59:58.270" style="s2">the goddamn thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.570" end="00:59:59.970" style="s2">alright I have to add the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.270" end="01:00:02.530" style="s2">that polarity though because I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.970" end="01:00:04.120" style="s2">connected to a lot of activists which I</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.530" end="01:00:06.460" style="s2">will sometimes call action ist&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.120" end="01:00:08.020" style="s2">know that I just obsessed with doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.460" end="01:00:09.940" style="s2">action and actually don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.020" end="01:00:11.380" style="s2">process of learning engage there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.940" end="01:00:12.850" style="s2">process of reflection and so there has</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.380" end="01:00:14.670" style="s2">to be a balance between those things and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.850" end="01:00:16.840" style="s2">it&#39;s why I&#39;m always emphasizing this</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.670" end="01:00:19.960" style="s2">institute some kind of rhythm of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.840" end="01:00:21.820" style="s2">retrospective of reflection of learning</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.960" end="01:00:23.890" style="s2">like make those learning loops really</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.820" end="01:00:25.510" style="s2">explicit and say every week or every</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.890" end="01:00:26.920" style="s2">month we have this moment where we stop</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.510" end="01:00:30.190" style="s2">and we reflect on the action that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.920" end="01:00:31.600" style="s2">done so that you&#39;re certainly most of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.190" end="01:00:32.800" style="s2">your energy is going into acting because</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.600" end="01:00:34.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that you learn the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.800" end="01:00:36.790" style="s2">but you also have to stop for a second</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.420" end="01:00:38.470" style="s2">stop doing per second to look around and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.790" end="01:00:42.610" style="s2">go what if we learn from there and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.470" end="01:00:44.920" style="s2">move again yeah I agree for sure let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.610" end="01:00:47.560" style="s2">move on to another topic and this is one</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.920" end="01:00:50.770" style="s2">of your lesser-known essays on medium</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.560" end="01:00:52.540" style="s2">called I will if you will which is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.770" end="01:00:55.420" style="s2">very interesting idea of making a</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.540" end="01:00:57.970" style="s2">conditional commitment so if enough of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.420" end="01:01:01.090" style="s2">us agree to do X you know like a death</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.970" end="01:01:02.650" style="s2">strike or or something like that then it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.090" end="01:01:04.060" style="s2">will trigger our mutual commitment to go</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.650" end="01:01:06.130" style="s2">forward but if we don&#39;t get a critical</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.060" end="01:01:08.080" style="s2">mass it won&#39;t what more can you say</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.130" end="01:01:09.430" style="s2">about that I think you actually called</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.080" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">out some tools and things of that sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.430" end="01:01:13.570" style="s2">that might be useful for people who want</p>

<p begin="01:01:13.570" end="01:01:17.220" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:19.590" style="s2">this is funny because I&#39;m an absolute</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.220" end="01:01:21.720" style="s2">amateur in this field you know I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.590" end="01:01:24.150" style="s2">some stuff with you know technology for</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.720" end="01:01:26.190" style="s2">social movements and so I was invited by</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.150" end="01:01:27.750" style="s2">some folks from extinction rebellion who</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.190" end="01:01:29.310" style="s2">were planning some various conditional</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.750" end="01:01:30.390" style="s2">commitment initiatives they said you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.310" end="01:01:33.210" style="s2">know would you would you have some</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.390" end="01:01:34.770" style="s2">opinions on us on what we&#39;re doing and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.210" end="01:01:36.030" style="s2">spent a day doing some research and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.770" end="01:01:37.560" style="s2">pulling together some links and seeing</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.030" end="01:01:39.930" style="s2">what&#39;s out there and talking to my</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.560" end="01:01:41.490" style="s2">contacts and so on and did the thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.930" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">that I do which is push that all into a</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.490" end="01:01:45.690" style="s2">blog post so that I don&#39;t have to keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:47.640" style="s2">it in my memory and and just list it out</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.690" end="01:01:49.140" style="s2">there to say like this is this is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.640" end="01:01:51.060" style="s2">state of the art as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.140" end="01:01:52.140" style="s2">from one day of research and some good</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.060" end="01:01:54.960" style="s2">conversations with people in the field</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.140" end="01:01:57.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so far outside of my</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.960" end="01:02:00.030" style="s2">my day-to-day expertise I think or not</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.000" end="01:02:02.070" style="s2">so far but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not core to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.030" end="01:02:03.990" style="s2">what I know about but the the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.070" end="01:02:06.690" style="s2">essential principle to me it feels</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.990" end="01:02:07.800" style="s2">pretty sound it&#39;s got some its there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.690" end="01:02:09.750" style="s2">been some good examples of people</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.800" end="01:02:11.730" style="s2">pulling it off well so that&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.750" end="01:02:13.650" style="s2">rent strikes a really good example and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.730" end="01:02:15.630" style="s2">those are currently happening especially</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.650" end="01:02:18.270" style="s2">in the US all over the place where</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.630" end="01:02:20.190" style="s2">people are at least organizing in their</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.270" end="01:02:25.620" style="s2">building or an enabler complex with is</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.190" end="01:02:27.090" style="s2">one one property owner and if you can go</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.620" end="01:02:29.070" style="s2">around the neighborhood whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.090" end="01:02:31.800" style="s2">in person or online and get them to</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.070" end="01:02:32.940" style="s2">pledge yeah I need to have these</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.800" end="01:02:35.220" style="s2">conditions change or else we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.940" end="01:02:37.320" style="s2">going to pay that pay the rent it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.220" end="01:02:39.000" style="s2">easy for someone to say I will if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.320" end="01:02:40.650" style="s2">will that really lowers the threshold of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.000" end="01:02:41.940" style="s2">their of their commitment and once</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.650" end="01:02:44.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that critical mass then you</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.940" end="01:02:46.110" style="s2">can then you can initiate so there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.070" end="01:02:47.340" style="s2">some there are some tools the reason I</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.110" end="01:02:49.500" style="s2">was doing that research because there</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.340" end="01:02:51.660" style="s2">were there were plans for a really</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.500" end="01:02:52.980" style="s2">significant debt strike in the UK and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.660" end="01:02:55.230" style="s2">then they backed away from that I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.980" end="01:02:57.180" style="s2">because I&#39;m not sure exactly it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.230" end="01:02:58.590" style="s2">foggy but I think it&#39;s because the legal</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.180" end="01:03:00.090" style="s2">implications of doing this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.590" end="01:03:01.590" style="s2">that to get really serious you know when</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.090" end="01:03:03.330" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about people default</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.590" end="01:03:04.980" style="s2">intentionally taking on debt just so</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.330" end="01:03:06.150" style="s2">they can default on just so they can try</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.980" end="01:03:09.990" style="s2">and throw a spanner in the works of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.150" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">finance it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s some really risky</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.990" end="01:03:12.930" style="s2">territory so I think they backed out of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:13.950" style="s2">that but there I know that some of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.930" end="01:03:15.510" style="s2">people that have been involved with</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.950" end="01:03:17.490" style="s2">extinction rebellion have have run</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.510" end="01:03:19.230" style="s2">smaller scale conditional commitment</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.490" end="01:03:20.850" style="s2">campaigns with some success so I</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.230" end="01:03:22.280" style="s2">definitely yeah I think it&#39;s a field</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.850" end="01:03:25.320" style="s2">that&#39;s right for more experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.280" end="01:03:28.290" style="s2">great I will reveal here now for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.320" end="01:03:30.780" style="s2">first time that there&#39;s a document being</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.290" end="01:03:33.810" style="s2">prepared by one of the leading figures</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.780" end="01:03:37.280" style="s2">in the game be space not me that will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.810" end="01:03:40.830" style="s2">proposing a conditional commitment for a</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.280" end="01:03:43.260" style="s2">radical reform or Jubilee you pick which</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.830" end="01:03:46.350" style="s2">one and we&#39;ll have more to say about</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.260" end="01:03:49.920" style="s2">that soon so this is I think very timely</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.350" end="01:03:50.910" style="s2">and I would point people to Rich&#39;s paper</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.920" end="01:03:52.980" style="s2">at least as a primer</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.910" end="01:03:55.350" style="s2">I&#39;m glad you qualified how far along you</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.980" end="01:03:56.940" style="s2">were in that but I found it useful we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.350" end="01:03:59.910" style="s2">see where this idea goes I think it has</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.940" end="01:04:02.430" style="s2">huge potential it corresponds sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.910" end="01:04:04.710" style="s2">using technology and networks to the old</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.430" end="01:04:06.600" style="s2">idea of the anarchist the general strike</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.710" end="01:04:09.210" style="s2">if you remember that from your anarchist</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.600" end="01:04:11.040" style="s2">literature I mean it&#39;s a it just has</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.210" end="01:04:12.990" style="s2">this kind of a beautiful idea about it</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.040" end="01:04:15.360" style="s2">right maybe just you can coordinate all</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.990" end="01:04:16.710" style="s2">these people to anticipate some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.360" end="01:04:18.150" style="s2">shared action and they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.710" end="01:04:19.530" style="s2">expose themselves until there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.150" end="01:04:20.940" style="s2">critical mass but they know they can win</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.530" end="01:04:22.860" style="s2">that I think I think it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.940" end="01:04:25.530" style="s2">devious and I really love it and I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.860" end="01:04:27.720" style="s2">excited to hear that game be people have</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.530" end="01:04:30.690" style="s2">got something in the works yeah it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.720" end="01:04:33.450" style="s2">interesting you&#39;ve been playing working</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.690" end="01:04:35.700" style="s2">living in this world of self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.450" end="01:04:37.290" style="s2">work life and culture for number of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.700" end="01:04:39.690" style="s2">years I don&#39;t know quite how long but</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.290" end="01:04:41.340" style="s2">how do you see it progressing and what</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.690" end="01:04:43.290" style="s2">do you think we need to speed up the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.340" end="01:04:45.240" style="s2">transition so that it&#39;s just not a few</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.290" end="01:04:48.120" style="s2">of us maniacs out on the fringe but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.240" end="01:04:49.830" style="s2">large numbers of people it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.120" end="01:04:51.750" style="s2">question it does feel that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.830" end="01:04:54.840" style="s2">momentum underway I have a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.750" end="01:04:55.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a growing portion of people in</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.840" end="01:04:58.140" style="s2">the world that are really dissatisfied</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.590" end="01:04:59.730" style="s2">with the status quo and we&#39;ll see what</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.140" end="01:05:01.080" style="s2">happens with this pandemic with everyone</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.730" end="01:05:03.210" style="s2">taking a break from their business as</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.080" end="01:05:04.710" style="s2">usual if that I have a sense that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.210" end="01:05:07.320" style="s2">might shake a few more monkeys out of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.710" end="01:05:08.820" style="s2">the tree that people have have a moment</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.320" end="01:05:10.470" style="s2">to stop and reflect on their life and</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.820" end="01:05:11.790" style="s2">look at their you know what are they</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.470" end="01:05:13.620" style="s2">spending their time on and how does that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.790" end="01:05:14.490" style="s2">relate to their values and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.620" end="01:05:17.190" style="s2">not so satisfying</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.490" end="01:05:18.810" style="s2">the main obstacle then I see and this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.190" end="01:05:23.370" style="s2">this is really core to my work I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.810" end="01:05:26.310" style="s2">is that doing the self-organizing group</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.370" end="01:05:28.170" style="s2">thing for starters it&#39;s kind of new</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.310" end="01:05:29.910" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s ancient and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.170" end="01:05:31.380" style="s2">touch most of us have lost lost touch</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.910" end="01:05:34.230" style="s2">with the old ways of doing it but for</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.380" end="01:05:36.840" style="s2">most of us modern people it&#39;s new and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.230" end="01:05:38.250" style="s2">experimental and my view is that there</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.840" end="01:05:41.480" style="s2">is no blueprint that you can copy and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.250" end="01:05:42.650" style="s2">expect it to work well and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.480" end="01:05:44.480" style="s2">the contention that we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.650" end="01:05:46.760" style="s2">start from a blank slate a blank slate</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.480" end="01:05:49.070" style="s2">either I really believe that there are</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.760" end="01:05:50.330" style="s2">design patterns that work transcon</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.070" end="01:05:52.060" style="s2">textually that you can take from one</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.330" end="01:05:55.190" style="s2">place and implement in another place and</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.060" end="01:05:57.140" style="s2">and you can&#39;t take an entire</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.190" end="01:05:58.940" style="s2">organization with with all of their</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.140" end="01:06:00.470" style="s2">rules and regulations but I think you</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.940" end="01:06:02.720" style="s2">can take some of the practices and some</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.470" end="01:06:04.790" style="s2">of them the modules and that&#39;s why yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.720" end="01:06:06.109" style="s2">you know that the book that I wrote and</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.790" end="01:06:07.670" style="s2">now which we&#39;ve developed into an online</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.109" end="01:06:09.560" style="s2">course we call it patterns for</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.670" end="01:06:11.600" style="s2">decentralized organizing is to try and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.560" end="01:06:13.400" style="s2">name some of these patterns so so some</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.600" end="01:06:14.840" style="s2">of the obvious ones are like decision</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.400" end="01:06:16.670" style="s2">making if you&#39;re going to work in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.840" end="01:06:18.020" style="s2">group you&#39;re going to have to have some</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.670" end="01:06:20.030" style="s2">way of taking decisions and we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.020" end="01:06:22.520" style="s2">compiled look these are some that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.030" end="01:06:24.500" style="s2">some decision-making methods that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.520" end="01:06:27.230" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen work really well and these</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.500" end="01:06:28.700" style="s2">are our way of doing it we name four</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.230" end="01:06:30.590" style="s2">different methods and say like the good</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.700" end="01:06:32.090" style="s2">for four different contexts and a mature</p>

<p begin="01:06:32.090" end="01:06:34.520" style="s2">switch between those different methods</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.170" end="01:06:36.380" style="s2">in different contexts but you need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.520" end="01:06:38.000" style="s2">have that shared language like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.380" end="01:06:40.820" style="s2">in a group where everything is done by</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.000" end="01:06:42.050" style="s2">consensus or everything is done by just</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.820" end="01:06:44.180" style="s2">you know what they call it democracy</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.050" end="01:06:46.310" style="s2">like a free-for-all where people do what</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.180" end="01:06:48.320" style="s2">they want if that&#39;s the only decision</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.310" end="01:06:49.460" style="s2">method you&#39;ve got it&#39;s it&#39;s not a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.320" end="01:06:51.140" style="s2">resilient system but if you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.460" end="01:06:53.030" style="s2">multiple decision methods you&#39;re likely</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.140" end="01:06:55.580" style="s2">to be able to deploy the right tool for</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.030" end="01:06:57.470" style="s2">the job and then we talk about conflict</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.580" end="01:06:59.330" style="s2">is another really classic one like new</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.470" end="01:07:00.470" style="s2">group start and they&#39;re having a great</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.330" end="01:07:01.730" style="s2">time and it feels like they&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.470" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">the world and they will love each other</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.730" end="01:07:05.750" style="s2">and at some point the honeymoon runs out</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:08.119" style="s2">and then you have some conflicts and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.750" end="01:07:11.600" style="s2">very very common that a group will</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.119" end="01:07:13.220" style="s2">falter or terminate because of a deep</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.600" end="01:07:15.590" style="s2">conflict between some of the core people</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.220" end="01:07:17.600" style="s2">and this is the kind of thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.590" end="01:07:19.420" style="s2">can anticipate and if you anticipate it</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.600" end="01:07:21.830" style="s2">while you&#39;re still in your honeymoon and</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.420" end="01:07:23.150" style="s2">name some agreements about what are we</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.830" end="01:07:24.859" style="s2">going to do when things get tough who</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.150" end="01:07:27.890" style="s2">we&#39;re going to call on what are like you</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.859" end="01:07:30.109" style="s2">would have guiding principles if you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.890" end="01:07:32.600" style="s2">if you can name some of those things</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.109" end="01:07:33.980" style="s2">before it gets tough then when you hit</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.600" end="01:07:35.720" style="s2">the difficult time you&#39;ve got something</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.980" end="01:07:36.980" style="s2">to lean back on but if you hit the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.720" end="01:07:39.140" style="s2">conflict and you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.980" end="01:07:41.180" style="s2">pre-existing structure for dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.140" end="01:07:43.490" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s a very difficult time to</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.180" end="01:07:44.630" style="s2">invent one right so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.490" end="01:07:47.810" style="s2">these kind of patterns that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.630" end="01:07:49.970" style="s2">articulating in our work and the big</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.810" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">frustration that I have is that people</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.970" end="01:07:53.290" style="s2">seem to intuitively understand if they</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.440" end="01:07:55.300" style="s2">want to do something self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.290" end="01:07:57.370" style="s2">that they can&#39;t really copy a blueprint</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.300" end="01:07:59.320" style="s2">and so what happens is everyone is out</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.370" end="01:08:00.730" style="s2">there in their own groups failing for</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.320" end="01:08:02.890" style="s2">the same reasons they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.730" end="01:08:05.350" style="s2">everything the hard way and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.890" end="01:08:07.510" style="s2">these kind of obstacles and problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.350" end="01:08:09.010" style="s2">that we articulate they&#39;re sufficient to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.510" end="01:08:11.830" style="s2">terminate a group you know like I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.010" end="01:08:13.540" style="s2">this this it&#39;s maybe eight to ten of</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.830" end="01:08:15.100" style="s2">these these core challenges of working</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.540" end="01:08:16.990" style="s2">with humans and if you hit any one of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.100" end="01:08:18.760" style="s2">those without the appropriate structure</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.990" end="01:08:20.470" style="s2">in place or the appropriate culture or</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.760" end="01:08:21.760" style="s2">there without even prepared for it it</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.470" end="01:08:25.420" style="s2">can be enough to terminate your group</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.760" end="01:08:27.010" style="s2">and so many of these new initiatives get</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.420" end="01:08:28.270" style="s2">underway and they they go really well</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.010" end="01:08:30.190" style="s2">for six months and then they just</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.270" end="01:08:31.270" style="s2">disintegrate and to me it&#39;s essential</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.190" end="01:08:32.710" style="s2">that we&#39;re learning from each other and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.270" end="01:08:34.600" style="s2">so I&#39;m doing my little piece of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.710" end="01:08:35.980" style="s2">with my partner with our little company</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.600" end="01:08:37.780" style="s2">the hum trying to produce training</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.980" end="01:08:39.310" style="s2">material you know but there&#39;s more to it</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.780" end="01:08:41.350" style="s2">than that it&#39;s not just about us having</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.310" end="01:08:43.000" style="s2">the one true curriculum I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.350" end="01:08:45.280" style="s2">more about learning how do we share</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.000" end="01:08:46.660" style="s2">experience of what are we doing in our</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.280" end="01:08:47.830" style="s2">groups and what&#39;s going well what can we</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.660" end="01:08:49.600" style="s2">learn from each other what&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.830" end="01:08:51.870" style="s2">how do we support each other this is one</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.600" end="01:08:54.370" style="s2">of the critical success factors of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.870" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">Inspiral is that we have all of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.370" end="01:08:58.390" style="s2">small groups and everyone cares about</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:08:59.560" style="s2">everyone so like what if your group is</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.390" end="01:09:01.810" style="s2">in trouble I&#39;m gonna come over and help</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.560" end="01:09:04.210" style="s2">you out and having that community of</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.810" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">peers we&#39;re where we are invested in</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.210" end="01:09:09.010" style="s2">each other but we&#39;re not completely</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:10.750" style="s2">tightly bound together you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.010" end="01:09:12.190" style="s2">a little bit of distance there creates</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.750" end="01:09:16.210" style="s2">an excellent environment for learning</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.190" end="01:09:18.250" style="s2">and support so I think that yeah more</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.210" end="01:09:19.720" style="s2">peer to peer exchange between these</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.250" end="01:09:22.569" style="s2">collaborative groups would go a long way</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.720" end="01:09:23.859" style="s2">that&#39;s my best guess for now yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.569" end="01:09:24.819" style="s2">would let me throw out something else to</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.859" end="01:09:25.900" style="s2">you they think about cuz I absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.819" end="01:09:29.470" style="s2">agree with you and that&#39;s actually my</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.900" end="01:09:32.020" style="s2">next topic but my sense if zooming that</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.470" end="01:09:33.819" style="s2">this koba nineteen pandemic thing does</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.020" end="01:09:35.170" style="s2">not actually crash the system and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.819" end="01:09:37.510" style="s2">don&#39;t believe it will but I think it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.170" end="01:09:40.780" style="s2">be a big shock so I don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.510" end="01:09:42.910" style="s2">the revolutionary moment yet but what I</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.780" end="01:09:44.859" style="s2">do think is happening based on talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.910" end="01:09:47.049" style="s2">to a lot of people over the last six</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.859" end="01:09:49.060" style="s2">weeks is that the number of people who</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.049" end="01:09:51.940" style="s2">have ears to hear about something</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.060" end="01:09:54.550" style="s2">different is been very substantially</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.940" end="01:09:56.980" style="s2">increased perhaps by a factor of 10 or</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.550" end="01:09:58.720" style="s2">maybe even more you describe</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.980" end="01:10:00.550" style="s2">dissatisfied with the status quo or</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.720" end="01:10:03.340" style="s2">maybe he just took a break from the rat</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.550" end="01:10:05.500" style="s2">race and realized what the hell have I</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.340" end="01:10:06.850" style="s2">been doing for the last 15 years what</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.500" end="01:10:08.890" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.850" end="01:10:10.240" style="s2">going to these stupid meetings dealing</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.890" end="01:10:12.850" style="s2">with morons who don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.240" end="01:10:14.710" style="s2">operate a meeting making no or bad</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.850" end="01:10:16.240" style="s2">decisions that don&#39;t really matter why</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.710" end="01:10:19.270" style="s2">do I live this way this is absurd</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.240" end="01:10:21.460" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be a better way so the</p>

<p begin="01:10:25.240" end="01:10:31.660" style="s2">accelerate the creation of artifacts to</p>

<p begin="01:10:51.190" end="01:10:55.090" style="s2">done goddamn it and publish it there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.740" end="01:10:57.640" style="s2">be a probably at ten times bigger</p>

<p begin="01:11:07.630" end="01:11:11.890" style="s2">course because that that felt more alive</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.970" end="01:11:14.170" style="s2">you know they have have a space where</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.890" end="01:11:15.940" style="s2">people can meet each other and learn</p>

<p begin="01:11:25.450" end="01:11:30.820" style="s2">shiny I have to say that this emergence</p>

<p begin="01:11:37.060" end="01:11:40.780" style="s2">a lot of different groups to use the</p>

<p begin="01:11:59.380" end="01:12:02.860" style="s2">structures that we can use that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.390" end="01:12:05.140" style="s2">will replicate very well into different</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.860" end="01:12:06.910" style="s2">contexts that&#39;s actually a very good</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.140" end="01:12:09.700" style="s2">point I had not really focused on that</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.910" end="01:12:12.130" style="s2">that practices ought to be more</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.700" end="01:12:14.590" style="s2">contagious to use an appropriate word of</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.130" end="01:12:16.870" style="s2">the moment than principles right even if</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.590" end="01:12:18.970" style="s2">we have opposite principles we can use</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.870" end="01:12:20.829" style="s2">the same practices alright let&#39;s go on</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.970" end="01:12:23.290" style="s2">to our last topic here we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.829" end="01:12:24.429" style="s2">near our time which is this has been</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.290" end="01:12:26.829" style="s2">something that was in the game B</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.429" end="01:12:29.139" style="s2">playbook from the very beginning but we</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.829" end="01:12:30.760" style="s2">never had time for it we were trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.139" end="01:12:33.159" style="s2">build our own little movement but I am</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.760" end="01:12:35.349" style="s2">now getting outreach from other people</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.159" end="01:12:37.960" style="s2">and I&#39;m reaching out to them and this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.349" end="01:12:40.540" style="s2">what we called the big change movement</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.960" end="01:12:42.369" style="s2">to your point there are lots of groups</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.540" end="01:12:44.829" style="s2">now that are interested in serious</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.369" end="01:12:46.800" style="s2">social change and they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.829" end="01:12:49.480" style="s2">right you know the the regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.800" end="01:12:51.639" style="s2">ecological people I&#39;m quite close to is</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.480" end="01:12:54.610" style="s2">that the same as game B no but is there</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.639" end="01:12:57.790" style="s2">overlap for sure I&#39;ve gotten to know</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.610" end="01:12:59.889" style="s2">recently the Hansie branch at least of</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.790" end="01:13:01.809" style="s2">the meta modernists not the same some</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.889" end="01:13:03.550" style="s2">overlap some serious goals some</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.809" end="01:13:05.829" style="s2">differences on method etc and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.550" end="01:13:09.639" style="s2">lots and lots more love to know your</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.829" end="01:13:13.139" style="s2">ideas about tools protocols and your</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.639" end="01:13:16.329" style="s2">word practices on what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.139" end="01:13:18.070" style="s2">should be in place for this big change</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.329" end="01:13:20.710" style="s2">movement because we know that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.070" end="01:13:23.139" style="s2">want to corral people into some common</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.710" end="01:13:24.909" style="s2">you know set of doctrines but we want</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.139" end="01:13:28.090" style="s2">them to be able to share things that</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.909" end="01:13:30.250" style="s2">they&#39;ve learned insights etc without</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.090" end="01:13:33.340" style="s2">anybody dominating the other you know so</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.250" end="01:13:36.429" style="s2">it&#39;s a truly collegial sense that all</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.340" end="01:13:38.650" style="s2">together are more than each apart yet</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.429" end="01:13:41.380" style="s2">there&#39;s no dominance or attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.650" end="01:13:42.940" style="s2">divert anybody from their own trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.380" end="01:13:45.309" style="s2">you know what thoughts do you have for</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.940" end="01:13:47.820" style="s2">how one might go about crafting a big</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.309" end="01:13:50.139" style="s2">change movement at this point in time I</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.820" end="01:13:51.639" style="s2">think with a question like that I can</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.139" end="01:13:54.070" style="s2">only answer for my intuition you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.639" end="01:13:56.260" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of too big a puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.070" end="01:13:57.849" style="s2">to solve rationally my instinctive</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.260" end="01:14:01.750" style="s2">position is that we need a drill on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.849" end="01:14:03.190" style="s2">fundamentals that means thank all this</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.750" end="01:14:06.610" style="s2">focus on putting on small groups it</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.190" end="01:14:08.559" style="s2">snake we need to have I think we need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.610" end="01:14:10.809" style="s2">have millions of people in the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.559" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">that are ready to mobilize a group of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.809" end="01:14:15.070" style="s2">people to work on their little patch and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:16.690" style="s2">and that feel competent to do that and</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.070" end="01:14:17.590" style="s2">feel encouraged and supported to do that</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.690" end="01:14:19.570" style="s2">well and that they&#39;re going to learn</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.590" end="01:14:21.969" style="s2">from each other because what I see at</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.570" end="01:14:25.000" style="s2">the moment is like you see it you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.969" end="01:14:26.739" style="s2">way more talk than action and and this</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.000" end="01:14:28.270" style="s2">feeling that there&#39;s a huge there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.739" end="01:14:29.770" style="s2">huge threshold before someone gets</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.270" end="01:14:31.260" style="s2">activated and I want to lower that</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.770" end="01:14:34.710" style="s2">threshold and make it more of a rare</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.260" end="01:14:36.660" style="s2">and that people let&#39;s like this move</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.710" end="01:14:37.830" style="s2">from from being a podcast audience to</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.660" end="01:14:40.230" style="s2">being a podcast community of</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.830" end="01:14:41.850" style="s2">peer-to-peer action and mutual aid you</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.230" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">know I think that that&#39;s the gesture</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.850" end="01:14:46.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m on and and that means doing the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:48.200" style="s2">basics like you say learn how to host a</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.470" end="01:14:52.080" style="s2">medium you know learn how to how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.200" end="01:14:54.150" style="s2">organize people and and make decisions</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.080" end="01:14:56.160" style="s2">together and get some actions going and</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.150" end="01:14:58.620" style="s2">it can be the smallest thing I think the</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.160" end="01:15:00.240" style="s2">first phase isn&#39;t about how do we turn</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.620" end="01:15:02.460" style="s2">the economy upside down</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.240" end="01:15:04.230" style="s2">I think the first phase is think how do</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.460" end="01:15:06.090" style="s2">we make sure the elder people in our</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.230" end="01:15:07.320" style="s2">neighborhood are not going hungry doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.090" end="01:15:09.570" style="s2">the shopping for their more but you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.320" end="01:15:10.500" style="s2">like doing doing small gestures that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.570" end="01:15:12.450" style="s2">purpose doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.500" end="01:15:15.030" style="s2">transformative I think the practice can</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.450" end="01:15:18.540" style="s2">be transformative just discovering our</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.030" end="01:15:20.940" style="s2">agency and in our ability to work and</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.540" end="01:15:23.250" style="s2">function as a collective I think if more</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.940" end="01:15:25.740" style="s2">of us were more competent on there then</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.250" end="01:15:26.850" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t be so frightened about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.740" end="01:15:28.920" style="s2">future as I am now</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.850" end="01:15:31.200" style="s2">because this is what&#39;s motivating my</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.920" end="01:15:32.580" style="s2">work is there are so many utopians so</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.200" end="01:15:34.980" style="s2">many activists so many people who are</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.580" end="01:15:37.740" style="s2">willing to take a break from the status</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.980" end="01:15:40.080" style="s2">quo and if you look at them a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.740" end="01:15:41.400" style="s2">them are not very inspiring what they</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.080" end="01:15:43.380" style="s2">actually achieve you know a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.400" end="01:15:44.490" style="s2">fall to pieces a lot of their I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.380" end="01:15:46.530" style="s2">just look at what happened with their</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.490" end="01:15:48.840" style="s2">with the communes from the 60s most of</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.530" end="01:15:51.060" style="s2">them disintegrated into really horrible</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.840" end="01:15:53.940" style="s2">places you know and we&#39;ve got to take</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.060" end="01:15:55.620" style="s2">that seriously that the intention to</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.940" end="01:15:57.180" style="s2">start it fresh and do something good and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.620" end="01:15:59.100" style="s2">do something new is not enough we</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.180" end="01:16:01.020" style="s2">actually need to have the competencies</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.100" end="01:16:03.290" style="s2">to do it well and so my sense is we</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.020" end="01:16:05.340" style="s2">should be practicing today and and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.290" end="01:16:06.570" style="s2">developing those muscles and getting</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.340" end="01:16:08.210" style="s2">more and more competent to look after</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.570" end="01:16:10.140" style="s2">ourselves and their neighbors without</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.210" end="01:16:13.020" style="s2">institutional support that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.140" end="01:16:15.060" style="s2">that makes sense to me and and I guess</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.020" end="01:16:18.570" style="s2">the other part of what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.060" end="01:16:20.190" style="s2">working out loud so really making a</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.570" end="01:16:21.780" style="s2">practice of documenting everything I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.190" end="01:16:23.580" style="s2">learning as much as I can</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.780" end="01:16:24.870" style="s2">recording conversations in public and</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.580" end="01:16:26.910" style="s2">leaving those laying around so that</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.870" end="01:16:28.530" style="s2">other people who are on a similar quest</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.910" end="01:16:30.540" style="s2">can learn from me as I&#39;m learning from</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.530" end="01:16:33.090" style="s2">them I think open sourcing what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.540" end="01:16:34.770" style="s2">doing I think game B has been reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.090" end="01:16:36.450" style="s2">good at that there&#39;s a lot of surface</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.770" end="01:16:37.560" style="s2">area now online about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.450" end="01:16:39.690" style="s2">in the game B space I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.560" end="01:16:41.280" style="s2">really good but the stage beyond just</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.690" end="01:16:42.059" style="s2">open source is thinking in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.280" end="01:16:43.889" style="s2">modularity</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.059" end="01:16:45.989" style="s2">and identifying what are the component</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.889" end="01:16:47.969" style="s2">parts you call them piece parts that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.989" end="01:16:49.769" style="s2">can ship and say this is ready this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.969" end="01:16:51.499" style="s2">good you can use it wherever you are you</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.769" end="01:16:53.189" style="s2">know so I mentioned this podcast that</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.499" end="01:16:55.499" style="s2">manager that I was talking to you</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.189" end="01:16:57.269" style="s2">yesterday who has this 5,000 people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.499" end="01:16:58.739" style="s2">want to share money I was really happy</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.269" end="01:16:59.789" style="s2">to say to them look there is a piece</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.739" end="01:17:01.800" style="s2">part for that it&#39;s called open</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.789" end="01:17:03.389" style="s2">collective comm and it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.800" end="01:17:04.979" style="s2">excellent it&#39;s like a charitable</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.389" end="01:17:06.569" style="s2">foundation as a service it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.979" end="01:17:08.879" style="s2">excellent way of people pooling money</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.569" end="01:17:10.379" style="s2">together and handling all of the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.879" end="01:17:12.599" style="s2">taxes and the administration and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.379" end="01:17:14.280" style="s2">in a in a transparent way it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.599" end="01:17:17.249" style="s2">thing that piece is done now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.280" end="01:17:19.439" style="s2">need to replicate it so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.249" end="01:17:21.300" style="s2">takes a particular approach to strategy</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.439" end="01:17:23.099" style="s2">and to movement design to think in terms</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.300" end="01:17:24.599" style="s2">of modules and make sure that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.099" end="01:17:26.359" style="s2">checking them off when and one by one</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.599" end="01:17:29.339" style="s2">and not duplicating too much work</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.359" end="01:17:30.899" style="s2">all I can say to that is Amen brother I</p>
