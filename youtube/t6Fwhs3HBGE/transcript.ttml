<p begin="00:00:07.799" end="00:00:11.400" style="s2">Jordan Peterson contrasting him with</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">Russell Brand and seeing what the left</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.400" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">can learn from Jordan Peterson it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">become more important to display loyalty</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.040" style="s2">to our political tribe than it is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:23.580" style="s2">understand a person or an issue in all</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.040" end="00:00:25.800" style="s2">of its complexity I&#39;m Lauren hayatun and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.580" end="00:00:28.020" style="s2">I&#39;m exploring the new politics this on</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">the other side of this culture and I see</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.020" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">Jordan Peterson as a test case for</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:36.540" style="s2">getting there it&#39;s one of a few things</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:39.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen from people on the Left who</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.540" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">seem to be kind of asking that question</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.500" end="00:00:45.630" style="s2">but also I think there&#39;s a sense with</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:47.490" style="s2">some people on the left that they still</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.630" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have that conversation did</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.490" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">you feel nervous about doing it and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:53.790" style="s2">were your conclusions from doing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">project yeah I mean I was pretty sick</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.790" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">with anxiety in like the weeks leading</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.390" style="s2">up to it because I am from probably like</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">a traditional left activist circle where</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.390" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a real allergy to Peterson if</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">you want to just put it softly</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">and what we wanted to do was maybe ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:15.450" style="s2">for as a yes and to Peterson like what</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">as an approach that honors his strengths</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">and really kind of recognizes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:21.870" style="s2">contribution that he&#39;s made but also</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">from our perspective point to the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.870" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">in his thinking but even a tacit</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:28.440" style="s2">acknowledgement of those strengths there</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">was the fear that that would be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.440" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">on some level a betrayal and that did</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">play out in some of the comments to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">video we had a broadly positive response</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">we had people say like thank God a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">refreshing critique from a left</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">perspective that isn&#39;t just dismissing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">outright that there was some attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">engage but it was really nice the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">you framed it like we&#39;re we&#39;re ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">especially in social media we&#39;re tempted</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">to say to make an either/or judgement</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:56.580" style="s2">all the time yeah well this is a in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:01:58.830" style="s2">way the video was about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.580" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s thinking but on a more meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.830" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">level it was a commentary on a political</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">culture so we face this enormous</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:09.749" style="s2">pressure to either love or hate either</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:11.009" style="s2">public figures or issues or to endorse</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.749" end="00:02:12.310" style="s2">them and to reject him and be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.009" end="00:02:15.560" style="s2">public in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.310" end="00:02:17.180" style="s2">but people and issues are really complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:19.790" style="s2">and with someone like Jordan Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.180" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">can see lots of as I said in the video</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.790" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">profound contributions and strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">also areas for I feel like as thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">is really off and how can you hold that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:31.819" style="s2">complexity in a tribal polarized culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">where you&#39;re kind of shut down for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.819" end="00:02:36.110" style="s2">holding it and I think that that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:37.489" style="s2">is the new political space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.110" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">opening up there&#39;s more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.489" end="00:02:42.769" style="s2">willing to go like no I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:44.780" style="s2">just fall into a binary I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.769" end="00:02:46.250" style="s2">and stay open and hold the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.780" end="00:02:49.069" style="s2">mmm yeah it&#39;s something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.250" end="00:02:51.950" style="s2">talked about before on our podcast is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.069" end="00:02:53.750" style="s2">that hold that the kind of the test of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:56.510" style="s2">sort of maturity in a way is holding</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.750" end="00:02:58.160" style="s2">many truths at the same time and not</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.510" end="00:03:01.970" style="s2">necessarily sort of saying this is true</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.160" end="00:03:03.769" style="s2">but this is also true and it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.970" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">we&#39;re at a place this is also sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.769" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">the intellectual dark web for me as kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">of like is it possible to think in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">public and thinking in public is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:13.670" style="s2">different from kind of reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:15.140" style="s2">things and I hope I think I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.670" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">probably right that now a space is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.140" end="00:03:18.079" style="s2">starting to open up for that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">dialogue whereas maybe it wasn&#39;t or</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.079" end="00:03:22.489" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been because also the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:23.720" style="s2">the mainstream media doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.489" end="00:03:24.829" style="s2">allow that to happen if everything has</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.720" end="00:03:27.049" style="s2">to be fitted into a five-minute</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.829" end="00:03:29.060" style="s2">soundbite or whatever there&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.049" end="00:03:31.780" style="s2">a lot of time to unpack ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.060" end="00:03:34.340" style="s2">develop conversations and it feels that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.780" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">there is a space opening up for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.340" end="00:03:38.630" style="s2">possibility of genuine thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:40.910" style="s2">public which I guess is really an</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.630" end="00:03:43.430" style="s2">interesting place to be yeah and if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.910" end="00:03:46.370" style="s2">can try and create a space that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.430" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">from the get-go pushing people&#39;s buttons</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.370" end="00:03:50.450" style="s2">and triggers that puts them into this</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:53.959" style="s2">defensive mode if you really try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.450" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">honor and and and and it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.959" end="00:03:57.319" style="s2">basis of a procedure of inquiry it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:03:58.549" style="s2">basis of therapy it&#39;s that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.319" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">start with attacking someone you start</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.549" end="00:04:01.639" style="s2">with really honoring them and giving</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:04.010" style="s2">them a space to be seen and then from</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.639" end="00:04:05.450" style="s2">that place it&#39;s like okay I&#39;m I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.010" end="00:04:07.450" style="s2">open and that&#39;s what we found in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.450" end="00:04:09.230" style="s2">comments is that with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.450" end="00:04:11.299" style="s2">acknowledgement of Peterson which is I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.230" end="00:04:12.530" style="s2">think what Peterson fans are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.299" end="00:04:14.329" style="s2">it I don&#39;t think that they mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.530" end="00:04:16.789" style="s2">critiques per se it&#39;s more there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.329" end="00:04:18.769" style="s2">an acknowledgement of him and not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.789" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">an outright rejection yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.769" end="00:04:22.159" style="s2">and so that was I think what&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:24.050" style="s2">interesting is it obviously is in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.159" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">space it&#39;s not just the video the video</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.050" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">is the stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">and actually what was interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:31.320" style="s2">notice was did the tone or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">calm the conversation changed it become</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.320" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">more generative and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:36.210" style="s2">probably where we should be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.430" style="s2">get to yeah that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:40.889" style="s2">point as well about firstly about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.430" end="00:04:42.690" style="s2">we can only start to inquire from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.889" end="00:04:45.030" style="s2">place of safety which is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.690" end="00:04:46.169" style="s2">and actually if you like Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:47.970" style="s2">about this and even McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.169" end="00:04:50.010" style="s2">talks about this we have two systems we</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.970" end="00:04:51.479" style="s2">have one system and this is polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.010" end="00:04:53.340" style="s2">theory if you wanna kind of look at that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.479" end="00:04:55.139" style="s2">what&#39;s going on underneath we&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.340" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">in a defensive mode and we&#39;re not able</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.139" end="00:05:00.810" style="s2">to grow or we&#39;re in an inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">explorative mode and then we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.810" end="00:05:04.470" style="s2">and actually you&#39;re right political</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:06.930" style="s2">discussions have to respect that as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.470" end="00:05:09.570" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re also right when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.930" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">say that what turns off Peter I&#39;d count</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.570" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">myself a peace and peace and admirer</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:14.970" style="s2">certainly admire of his work I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:16.410" style="s2">like the word fan I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.970" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">a really dangerous energy to bring to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.410" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">anything because I&#39;ve also we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">put out some podcast sort of critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:24.600" style="s2">what we see as some of his blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:25.979" style="s2">but I think what turns me off and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.600" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">turns off a lot of other people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.979" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">admire his work is the energy that comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">through in a lot of the criticisms like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.210" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">you read things from from reporters that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">just say charlatans fraud or and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">read it and you just think okay there</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:43.139" style="s2">may be things that he&#39;s not he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:45.510" style="s2">seeing or he&#39;s got blind spots as</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.139" end="00:05:47.910" style="s2">everyone does but the energy and much of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.510" end="00:05:50.190" style="s2">the criticism is just so off that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.910" end="00:05:52.650" style="s2">think it really makes a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.190" end="00:05:53.550" style="s2">who&#39;ve become extremely for familiar</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.650" end="00:05:55.050" style="s2">this is the other thing people have</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.550" end="00:05:57.510" style="s2">become deeply familiar with his work</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.050" end="00:05:59.250" style="s2">over a long time usually at their own in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.510" end="00:06:00.840" style="s2">their own time so when they see this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.250" end="00:06:03.240" style="s2">coming out and the media they just think</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">okay there&#39;s something off about about</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.240" end="00:06:08.099" style="s2">the way that he&#39;s being critiqued well</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.620" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that that also</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.099" end="00:06:12.570" style="s2">needs to be met with the same energy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.620" end="00:06:14.820" style="s2">that person being seen and understood</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.570" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">that that product principle goes all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.820" end="00:06:19.470" style="s2">way down so in this case the people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">respond and say he&#39;s a charlatan he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.470" end="00:06:23.010" style="s2">misogynist he&#39;s a fascist it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.010" end="00:06:28.320" style="s2">like what aspect of of them feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">unsafe that would lead to a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.320" end="00:06:33.030" style="s2">reactive response instead of open</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:34.950" style="s2">curiosity and I think that behind that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.030" end="00:06:36.169" style="s2">is a whole set of emotional needs and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.950" end="00:06:37.729" style="s2">I think that at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.169" end="00:06:40.789" style="s2">best it&#39;s pointing to a form of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.729" end="00:06:42.740" style="s2">political engagement that basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.789" end="00:06:44.449" style="s2">doesn&#39;t immediately dismiss that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.740" end="00:06:47.870" style="s2">actually inquires into what&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.449" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">behind the thing yes people might not be</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.870" end="00:06:53.270" style="s2">open to that but I still think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:54.889" style="s2">an opportunity to model that as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.270" end="00:06:56.389" style="s2">general principle even if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.889" end="00:06:59.300" style="s2">unwilling to engage with it because I</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.389" end="00:07:01.810" style="s2">think that if you take let&#39;s say writers</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:05.389" style="s2">and feminist circles they have red lines</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.810" end="00:07:07.460" style="s2">around if there is a feeling that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.389" end="00:07:10.339" style="s2">is sexism there is misogyny there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">undermining of let&#39;s say black rights</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.339" end="00:07:14.810" style="s2">movements and and and whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.909" style="s2">Peterson is transgressing them is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.810" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">another thing but that if there is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.909" end="00:07:24.409" style="s2">feeling of that clearly that activates</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:25.729" style="s2">our very strong no and I think that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.409" end="00:07:27.349" style="s2">been thinking a lot about this in terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.729" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">of you know the left&#39;s relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.349" end="00:07:31.159" style="s2">identity politics and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:34.249" style="s2">talk about you know it needs to get its</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.159" end="00:07:37.249" style="s2">house in order it needs to reject it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.249" end="00:07:38.779" style="s2">and move into a space that more people</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.249" end="00:07:41.689" style="s2">can get on board with it but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.779" end="00:07:45.529" style="s2">question is is the politics that we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.689" end="00:07:48.020" style="s2">nowadays a kind of a reject or is it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.529" end="00:07:50.810" style="s2">can we try and integrate can we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.020" end="00:07:52.550" style="s2">include can we listen to the the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.810" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">genuine feelings that are there that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.550" end="00:07:57.620" style="s2">lead people to believe that the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.149" style="s2">can be primarily understood as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.620" end="00:08:01.189" style="s2">oppressive system where there is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.149" end="00:08:03.259" style="s2">oppressor class and there is an oppress</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.189" end="00:08:05.509" style="s2">and even if that analysis is wrong there</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.259" end="00:08:07.639" style="s2">are clearly personal experiences there</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.509" end="00:08:09.110" style="s2">are clearly emotions there that have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.639" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">be dealt with because they don&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.110" end="00:08:14.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you know it&#39;s you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:17.990" style="s2">rejecting it back into the shadows in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.930" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">way and I so I and maybe I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.990" end="00:08:23.389" style="s2">like how do we do that how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.870" end="00:08:25.879" style="s2">bring what is a therapeutic approach to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.389" end="00:08:28.669" style="s2">political conversation and and is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.879" end="00:08:31.099" style="s2">possible I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.669" end="00:08:33.979" style="s2">mean it&#39;s interesting because one of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.099" end="00:08:35.349" style="s2">criticisms of or critiques of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.979" end="00:08:38.149" style="s2">Peterson was that he is too reactive</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.349" end="00:08:41.149" style="s2">that he is subject to a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.149" end="00:08:45.199" style="s2">kind of relentless attacks from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.149" end="00:08:46.699" style="s2">media but the he our point was if he</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.199" end="00:08:48.620" style="s2">starts getting into reactivity in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.699" end="00:08:49.350" style="s2">response then a lot of people are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.620" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">going to hear his mess</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.350" end="00:08:55.740" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna see angry white man</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.750" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">and when we put that critique out there</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.740" end="00:08:58.770" style="s2">were quite a few people commenting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:00.930" style="s2">saying you&#39;re just blaming the victim</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.770" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">because he&#39;s just reacting he&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:04.740" style="s2">attacked relentlessly and you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:08.360" style="s2">and effectively we were saying we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.740" end="00:09:11.490" style="s2">asking for an almost superhuman level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.360" end="00:09:13.320" style="s2">transcendence from him and that almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.490" end="00:09:15.270" style="s2">nobody would have been able to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.320" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">under the under the weight of so many of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.270" end="00:09:18.510" style="s2">the mischaracterizations and stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">we see from the media so it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.510" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">we&#39;re asking for I I I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.940" style="s2">right like I bought this for a while</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">that you we do need to introduce some</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.940" end="00:09:30.930" style="s2">form of political therapy into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:33.300" style="s2">discourse it&#39;s like okay so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.930" end="00:09:35.010" style="s2">really going on what what are the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.300" end="00:09:36.630" style="s2">experiences little led you to because</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.010" end="00:09:37.920" style="s2">our political views are almost always a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.630" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">reflection of a deeper psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.920" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">reality and I think unless we make space</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:45.150" style="s2">for that psychological reality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:49.380" style="s2">no hope of of any kind of generative</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.150" end="00:09:51.270" style="s2">dialogue or real meeting but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.380" end="00:09:53.520" style="s2">asking an awful lot of people to be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.270" end="00:09:55.800" style="s2">to do that I think personally I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.520" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">all all we can do is create a space</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">where that create a space where that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2">the dominant frame that is then that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:07.650" style="s2">you create the space there&#39;s a dominant</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:09.810" style="s2">frame and then other people can come</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.650" end="00:10:11.160" style="s2">into it but understanding that not</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.810" end="00:10:12.630" style="s2">everyone will be able to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.160" end="00:10:14.610" style="s2">maybe that isn&#39;t a frame that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.630" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">appropriate for everybody and at some</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.610" end="00:10:19.710" style="s2">point if people have like wounds that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.360" end="00:10:22.520" style="s2">mean that they&#39;re really not able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.710" end="00:10:25.410" style="s2">engage in generative dialogue then</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.520" end="00:10:26.910" style="s2">accept the inclusivity I only go so far</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.410" end="00:10:28.530" style="s2">and this is a big problem on the left I</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:30.090" style="s2">think is wanting to have a space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.530" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">completely inclusive of absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.090" end="00:10:34.170" style="s2">everything but then if you&#39;re including</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:35.940" style="s2">people who are not able to respect the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.170" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">the ground rules of what an inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.940" end="00:10:40.830" style="s2">general generative dialogue means then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.540" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">think that&#39;s where the left gets into</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.830" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">trouble because it&#39;s not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:48.300" style="s2">policing boundaries around around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:49.950" style="s2">ground rules of its own generative</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.300" end="00:10:51.930" style="s2">dialogue and then it gets hijacked very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.950" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">very quickly like left spaces are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.930" end="00:10:56.700" style="s2">notorious for being hijacked by people</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:58.470" style="s2">with the with the most kind of keenly</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.700" end="00:11:00.960" style="s2">felt agendas and they&#39;re often the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.470" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">pathological agendas although what or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.960" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that come from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:04.410" style="s2">deepest honor</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">sense of wounding it&#39;s like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.410" end="00:11:08.550" style="s2">make space for that allow it to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.260" style="s2">processed but if it can&#39;t be processed</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.550" end="00:11:12.420" style="s2">then maybe it&#39;s not appropriate for them</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.260" end="00:11:14.490" style="s2">to be in that space I don&#39;t know but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.420" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">think that&#39;s part of the the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.490" end="00:11:17.850" style="s2">or the dynamic that comes in in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:18.870" style="s2">these spaces because Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.850" end="00:11:20.790" style="s2">about this it&#39;s like the left doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.870" end="00:11:23.190" style="s2">like boundaries hates boundaries hates</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.790" end="00:11:24.630" style="s2">hierarchies hates boundaries but it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.190" end="00:11:26.790" style="s2">need some boundaries to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.630" end="00:11:28.380" style="s2">generative dialogues yeah I mean I agree</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.790" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">and I think you&#39;ve described broadly the</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:43.650" style="s2">to such a level of influence there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.060" end="00:11:45.810" style="s2">this transition that you make from</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.490" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">might be kind of in the throes of a</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.670" end="00:12:12.300" style="s2">able to see but there are also young</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.350" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">students and they do mean well and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.300" end="00:12:16.050" style="s2">do see a very up world and want</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:17.220" style="s2">to change it and rather than and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.050" end="00:12:19.800" style="s2">particularly as a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.220" end="00:12:22.830" style="s2">rather than taking what I might assume</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.700" end="00:12:30.900" style="s2">from that place of openness bringing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.070" end="00:12:33.540" style="s2">them to a greater place of individuation</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.540" end="00:12:36.930" style="s2">just like you are the curse of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.190" end="00:12:39.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s like well well like it god it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.930" end="00:12:40.770" style="s2">no wonder the left hands a difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.330" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">going to board a Petersen there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.770" end="00:12:45.810" style="s2">being shouted at and so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">that you know the person that I see</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.810" end="00:12:50.640" style="s2">modeling this often the least is</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:52.770" style="s2">Peterson even though in other forums he</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.640" end="00:12:54.990" style="s2">I can see him very open to learning and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.770" end="00:12:58.350" style="s2">in this dialogue but when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.990" end="00:13:00.120" style="s2">the left just like oh I think I agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.350" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">with you about all of those points I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.120" end="00:13:06.690" style="s2">think there&#39;s the the issue for me is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:09.090" style="s2">because he says this also it&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.690" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">says people don&#39;t have ideas ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.090" end="00:13:14.040" style="s2">people so if that&#39;s true then where is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:17.160" style="s2">the compassion for people who are under</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.040" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">the sway of a pernicious idea and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.160" end="00:13:22.829" style="s2">I think part of that is that his</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:24.750" style="s2">trajectory so far has been in combat</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.829" end="00:13:27.930" style="s2">with the left I mean this was his like</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.750" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">his job was at risk and then he was also</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.930" end="00:13:31.889" style="s2">I think quite quickly because of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:33.750" style="s2">times we were in pulled into one side of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.889" end="00:13:36.149" style="s2">the culture wall and that worked for him</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.750" end="00:13:38.339" style="s2">for quite a while and I agree I do think</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.149" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">that especially now I kind of hoped that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.339" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">there could be some more openness to to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.810" style="s2">dialogue with the left because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:47.100" style="s2">actually don&#39;t think he is he like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.810" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">characterized as being on the right I</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.100" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">genuinely don&#39;t think he is I think he</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:56.100" style="s2">he is more of a centrist and I think is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">his natural sort of place of if he</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.100" end="00:14:01.470" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been sort of pushed so far by by</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:03.870" style="s2">a lot of the kind of the media</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.470" end="00:14:05.370" style="s2">interactions that he&#39;s had I think his</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.870" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">natural place would have been midway</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.370" end="00:14:08.939" style="s2">between the two but I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.410" end="00:14:11.189" style="s2">optics and the way that he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.939" end="00:14:14.730" style="s2">gotten success by pushing the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.189" end="00:14:16.439" style="s2">anti s JW student politics thing has</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.730" end="00:14:18.389" style="s2">probably locked him into a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.439" end="00:14:20.490" style="s2">a reactivity towards it and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.389" end="00:14:22.110" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of aftermath of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.490" end="00:14:24.449" style="s2">experience that he went in went through</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.110" end="00:14:25.800" style="s2">in Toronto as well that comes out in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.449" end="00:14:27.000" style="s2">way that because the way that he talks</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.800" end="00:14:30.089" style="s2">about the left is different from where</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.000" end="00:14:31.529" style="s2">he talks about the right yeah so I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.089" end="00:14:34.350" style="s2">say that there probably is some</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.529" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">political PTSD going on with his</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.350" end="00:14:39.720" style="s2">experience in Toronto and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">in a knee dynamic it&#39;s not just him</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.720" end="00:14:43.889" style="s2">being assailed and being reactive he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">also co-creating that dynamic and I do</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.889" end="00:14:50.670" style="s2">think that he has ridden the wave of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:53.579" style="s2">anti identity politics anti regressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.670" end="00:14:55.740" style="s2">left sentiment to get to this point and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.579" end="00:14:58.470" style="s2">I think that what all of us are calling</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.740" end="00:15:00.420" style="s2">for is can there be a transcendence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.470" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">that like in true developmental fashion</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.420" end="00:15:06.680" style="s2">can you know can Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">reinvent and remake himself in order to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.680" end="00:15:12.420" style="s2">unify more people and but but maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:15.029" style="s2">from what I see is that I don&#39;t see him</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.420" end="00:15:16.709" style="s2">being in a relationship to the left like</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.029" end="00:15:20.699" style="s2">the things that I would want to see from</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.709" end="00:15:23.970" style="s2">him is less skepticism about climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.699" end="00:15:27.089" style="s2">change more like explicit critique of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.970" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">Trump like that there are certain like</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.089" end="00:15:30.180" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t want to describe it as</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:32.520" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.180" end="00:15:35.490" style="s2">a box-ticking exercise but there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:37.320" style="s2">things that we would need to here on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.490" end="00:15:42.089" style="s2">left in order to feel like our this</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.320" end="00:15:43.260" style="s2">person speaks for us and I know that yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.089" end="00:15:46.050" style="s2">my my</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.260" end="00:15:49.110" style="s2">my thing is I still don&#39;t think the left</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.050" end="00:15:51.899" style="s2">is at any point ready to meet him that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.110" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">my my prop because I I even see like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.899" end="00:15:55.740" style="s2">people so obviously we&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:16:00.089" style="s2">interested in sort of integral thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:16:02.010" style="s2">this idea of yes and and I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.089" end="00:16:03.899" style="s2">even when I see kind of integral</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.010" end="00:16:06.180" style="s2">thinkers talking about being yes and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.899" end="00:16:08.490" style="s2">with Peterson the energy of it for me is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.180" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">not yes and it&#39;s still rejecting or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.490" end="00:16:13.860" style="s2">still saying no you&#39;re wrong about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:15.060" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure the left is yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.860" end="00:16:17.100" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.060" end="00:16:18.630" style="s2">that might be able to kind of integrate</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.100" end="00:16:20.520" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying but I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.630" end="00:16:22.649" style="s2">happening yet and I don&#39;t I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.520" end="00:16:24.029" style="s2">there&#39;s still there&#39;s still work that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.649" end="00:16:27.570" style="s2">needs to be done on both sides to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.029" end="00:16:29.310" style="s2">able to get there yes definitely I but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.570" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">may be and this is an idea that came</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.310" end="00:16:34.260" style="s2">from Jonathan Ryan&#39;s essay critique is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:37.529" style="s2">that it is a yes and or it is of both</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.260" end="00:16:41.490" style="s2">end and it&#39;s an either/or you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.529" end="00:16:43.410" style="s2">fully rounded position on Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.490" end="00:16:46.410" style="s2">virtues as weaknesses and then come down</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.410" end="00:16:47.370" style="s2">on the side of ultimately I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.410" end="00:16:50.130" style="s2">you&#39;re a positive force in the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.370" end="00:16:51.630" style="s2">ultimately I&#39;m critical that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.130" end="00:16:53.130" style="s2">talk enough about structural problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.630" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">and systemic issues this is the theme of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.130" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">the video that released was like I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.820" style="s2">love to see Peterson talk about systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:01.200" style="s2">change what needs to change in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.820" end="00:17:02.459" style="s2">structural level I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.200" end="00:17:03.990" style="s2">interview that you&#39;ve done with him</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.459" end="00:17:05.850" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about the structural</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.990" end="00:17:08.040" style="s2">conditions for psychological growth like</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:10.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the territory I would love to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.040" end="00:17:13.890" style="s2">him move into and also in terms of his</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.520" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">like he&#39;s very male centric and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:17.309" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s great that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:21.270" style="s2">public figure that is standing up for</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.309" end="00:17:23.100" style="s2">men but it also ideally it would take a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.270" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">progression towards being integrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.100" end="00:17:26.790" style="s2">and that women would also feel like he</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.380" end="00:17:29.480" style="s2">speaks for them because currently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.790" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">very easy just to see that he doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.110" end="00:17:40.620" style="s2">sort of describe what the I what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.970" end="00:17:42.030" style="s2">framing of alter ego is what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.620" end="00:17:43.420" style="s2">what&#39;s the aim with alter ego</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.030" end="00:17:45.640" style="s2">I think there</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.420" end="00:17:47.740" style="s2">framing of it now I began as this idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.640" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">of the progressive politics is in crisis</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.740" end="00:17:51.640" style="s2">it is a crisis of ideas and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:54.130" style="s2">controversial yeah and that spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.640" end="00:17:56.650" style="s2">is the place to look for answers that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.130" end="00:17:58.180" style="s2">we&#39;re missing that there&#39;s just a kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.650" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">of a limit to what we can do materialism</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.180" end="00:18:00.760" style="s2">and that there is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:02.860" style="s2">transcendent possibility with</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.760" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">spirituality that can renew progressive</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.860" end="00:18:06.610" style="s2">politics and like seeing movements on</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.200" style="s2">the right who are well equipped with</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.610" end="00:18:11.020" style="s2">mystical language and kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.200" end="00:18:14.140" style="s2">visceral embodied narrative what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.020" end="00:18:15.400" style="s2">turned into though is more of a project</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:17.050" style="s2">that&#39;s been inspired by integral</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.400" end="00:18:18.700" style="s2">thinking or developmental thinking so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.050" end="00:18:22.420" style="s2">think in one sense is trying to promote</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.700" end="00:18:23.620" style="s2">a developmental shift both in society</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.420" end="00:18:26.620" style="s2">recognising the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.620" end="00:18:29.350" style="s2">psychological growth but also that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.620" end="00:18:30.820" style="s2">psychological elements actually start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.350" end="00:18:32.680" style="s2">be integrated into political discussion</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.820" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">that we make the personal political that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.680" end="00:18:38.470" style="s2">we understand the ways in which our</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">psychology our shadow our biases frame</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.470" end="00:18:42.850" style="s2">how we see the world and that by</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:44.920" style="s2">actually you know growing in that domain</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.850" end="00:18:47.080" style="s2">we can actually outgrow those our</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.920" end="00:18:48.940" style="s2">problems or expand our way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.080" end="00:18:50.140" style="s2">things so that&#39;s the first shift to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.940" end="00:18:52.060" style="s2">developmental shift and the other is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.140" end="00:18:55.660" style="s2">dialectical shift it&#39;s kind of realizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.060" end="00:18:58.750" style="s2">the limits of if only the left were more</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.660" end="00:19:01.180" style="s2">organized communicated better did better</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.750" end="00:19:03.580" style="s2">grassroots organizing that we would win</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.180" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s a recognition that hold on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.580" end="00:19:07.420" style="s2">second like there&#39;s a whole other half</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:09.040" style="s2">of the population that has just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.420" end="00:19:11.860" style="s2">different mixture of Moral Sentiments</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.040" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">and like how do we actually integrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.860" end="00:19:15.880" style="s2">them how do we bring them into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:17.350" style="s2">dialectic and find the synthesis so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.880" end="00:19:18.850" style="s2">an attempt to both bring your</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.350" end="00:19:20.500" style="s2">developmental shift in a dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.850" end="00:19:21.880" style="s2">shift and we&#39;ve been doing that through</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.500" end="00:19:23.320" style="s2">gatherings and bring people together to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.880" end="00:19:25.780" style="s2">have those discussions for better or</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.320" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">worse and now the media channel is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.780" end="00:19:31.810" style="s2">attempt to model that kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:35.020" style="s2">in in the public space and so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.810" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">Russell Brand Jordan Peterson video was</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.020" end="00:19:39.130" style="s2">an attempt to go look here are two big</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:42.190" style="s2">public figures they&#39;re grounded in like</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.130" end="00:19:43.540" style="s2">real spiritual psychological ethos and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.190" end="00:19:46.060" style="s2">yet they&#39;re on different points of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.540" end="00:19:49.210" style="s2">spectrum and they&#39;re in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.060" end="00:19:51.010" style="s2">convivial dialogue let&#39;s let&#39;s use that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.210" end="00:19:53.830" style="s2">as a starting point and make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.010" end="00:19:56.450" style="s2">where where they are and even though we</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.830" end="00:19:58.999" style="s2">did reach a conclusion on Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.450" end="00:20:01.669" style="s2">from our perspective he doesn&#39;t go far</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.999" end="00:20:04.249" style="s2">enough we need more the idea more is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.669" end="00:20:06.259" style="s2">just to give people a more expanded idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.249" end="00:20:09.859" style="s2">of the space and for them to form their</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.259" end="00:20:12.529" style="s2">own opinion mmm because I guess I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.859" end="00:20:14.659" style="s2">we&#39;ve worked together on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.529" end="00:20:17.419" style="s2">alter ego gatherings and this this sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.659" end="00:20:18.889" style="s2">of general idea that we need to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.419" end="00:20:20.629" style="s2">a deeper level of political discussion</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.889" end="00:20:22.399" style="s2">we need to reintegrate what I would have</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.629" end="00:20:26.749" style="s2">said back then the spiritual I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.399" end="00:20:28.700" style="s2">since since really diving deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.749" end="00:20:31.249" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s thought I&#39;d now kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.700" end="00:20:33.049" style="s2">of recognize also the value of religion</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.249" end="00:20:34.549" style="s2">as well which I haven&#39;t done quite so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.049" end="00:20:36.859" style="s2">much before I think I really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.549" end="00:20:39.049" style="s2">understand the value of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.859" end="00:20:40.789" style="s2">deep encoded stories and mythologies of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.049" end="00:20:42.379" style="s2">spirituality rather than just the sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.789" end="00:20:44.840" style="s2">of the transition spirits to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.379" end="00:20:46.940" style="s2">transcendent experience so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.840" end="00:20:48.859" style="s2">an interesting journey for me and I also</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.940" end="00:20:50.809" style="s2">had a really real felt sense from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.859" end="00:20:54.019" style="s2">beginning of the project that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.809" end="00:20:56.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a tension between and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.019" end="00:20:59.629" style="s2">also where in the UK the the British</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.809" end="00:21:02.299" style="s2">Labour Party as well came out of both</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.629" end="00:21:04.669" style="s2">marks and Methodism that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.299" end="00:21:07.129" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.669" end="00:21:09.230" style="s2">of what are your initial axioms because</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.129" end="00:21:10.940" style="s2">if you if you&#39;ve come from a position of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.230" end="00:21:12.830" style="s2">kind of like the Marxist idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.940" end="00:21:16.369" style="s2">mainly talking about material conditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.830" end="00:21:20.779" style="s2">or you come from a conditioning &#39;full</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.369" end="00:21:22.820" style="s2">life a life that yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.779" end="00:21:25.369" style="s2">more of a spiritual or religious origin</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.820" end="00:21:27.019" style="s2">it&#39;s like those two things I think any</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.369" end="00:21:28.970" style="s2">conversation around this issue in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.019" end="00:21:31.789" style="s2">progressive circles is going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.970" end="00:21:33.559" style="s2">slight awkward tension between those two</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.789" end="00:21:34.999" style="s2">things can I add another axiom that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.559" end="00:21:37.609" style="s2">think is really important in this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.999" end="00:21:39.529" style="s2">that the Marxist materialist frame also</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.609" end="00:21:41.299" style="s2">has a power dynamic at its center it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.529" end="00:21:42.830" style="s2">about capital versus labor it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.299" end="00:21:45.649" style="s2">oppressor class versus depressed which</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.830" end="00:21:47.960" style="s2">like I believe that analysis holds out</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.649" end="00:21:50.029" style="s2">but with a spiritual perspective or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.960" end="00:21:52.039" style="s2">psychological perspective there also is</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.029" end="00:21:54.259" style="s2">that realization that every person in</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.039" end="00:21:55.909" style="s2">that dynamic is suffering on some level</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.259" end="00:21:58.279" style="s2">all of us are wounded all of us are</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.909" end="00:22:01.639" style="s2">playing out dynamics from her childhood</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.279" end="00:22:03.559" style="s2">and it adds in a just more spaciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.639" end="00:22:06.679" style="s2">around that and a possibility of some</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.559" end="00:22:08.930" style="s2">kind of resolution rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.679" end="00:22:11.420" style="s2">dominant frame in Marxism which</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.930" end="00:22:13.010" style="s2">is counter hegemony and again I&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.420" end="00:22:14.770" style="s2">do believe there is a place for counter</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.010" end="00:22:17.420" style="s2">hegemony and there are powerful</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.770" end="00:22:21.040" style="s2">individuals and systems in place that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.420" end="00:22:24.050" style="s2">are damaging and they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.040" end="00:22:26.210" style="s2">contested but I also think that one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.050" end="00:22:28.760" style="s2">the the brilliant aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.210" end="00:22:31.340" style="s2">spiritual is this greater compassion for</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.760" end="00:22:33.530" style="s2">the individual no matter where position</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.340" end="00:22:34.700" style="s2">they occupy in the hierarchy and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.530" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">this is this is something that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.700" end="00:22:37.340" style="s2">Peterson talks about and I really</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">recognize as being a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.340" end="00:22:42.230" style="s2">difference is I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:43.850" style="s2">implicitly accept a set of axioms about</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.230" end="00:22:45.530" style="s2">necessarily knowing that they do and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.850" end="00:22:47.510" style="s2">that for me is the issue with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.530" end="00:22:50.330" style="s2">identity politics left is that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.510" end="00:22:53.030" style="s2">implicitly accept the axioms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.330" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">collectivism they implicitly accept the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.030" end="00:22:58.130" style="s2">axioms of kind of privat that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">language around sort of white privilege</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.130" end="00:23:03.020" style="s2">and your your that your group identity</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:04.700" style="s2">is more important than your individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.020" end="00:23:06.410" style="s2">identity and that&#39;s happens at a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.700" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">sort of subtle level whereas actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.410" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">what Peterson for me is bringing back as</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:14.420" style="s2">a sense of no we have two primary accent</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:15.890" style="s2">axiom has to be the divinity of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.420" end="00:23:18.350" style="s2">individual and that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.890" end="00:23:19.790" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved over millennia and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.350" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">in danger of throwing that out with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.790" end="00:23:26.660" style="s2">bathwater because we have this very</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:28.220" style="s2">well-meaning idea that a prep the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.660" end="00:23:29.510" style="s2">dominant narrative should be oppression</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.220" end="00:23:30.530" style="s2">which should be seeing therefore we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.510" end="00:23:32.510" style="s2">seeing people through their group</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.530" end="00:23:35.810" style="s2">identity rather than their individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.510" end="00:23:37.310" style="s2">identity so I I would slightly disagree</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.810" end="00:23:38.870" style="s2">or at least maybe offer another</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.310" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">perspective so you have like Toulouse</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.870" end="00:23:42.920" style="s2">and Qatari who were like kind of famous</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:44.600" style="s2">post modernist theorists who would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.920" end="00:23:46.450" style="s2">that the individual is dead and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.600" end="00:23:49.460" style="s2">dividual it&#39;s the transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.450" end="00:23:52.010" style="s2">individual that lives in relational</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.460" end="00:23:54.020" style="s2">context and the idea of this binary</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.010" end="00:23:56.120" style="s2">between the individual and the group and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.020" end="00:23:58.610" style="s2">the and Peterson kind of really bringing</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.120" end="00:24:01.130" style="s2">the individual back I think that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.610" end="00:24:03.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a false dichotomy and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.130" end="00:24:05.240" style="s2">we need to I&#39;m basically just</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.020" end="00:24:07.880" style="s2">introducing that as a more as a concept</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.240" end="00:24:09.770" style="s2">for us to hold rather than seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.880" end="00:24:11.480" style="s2">two things in tension but it&#39;s like for</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.770" end="00:24:14.090" style="s2">me it&#39;s like it&#39;s a both and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.480" end="00:24:15.740" style="s2">clear that if the group becomes</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.090" end="00:24:20.060" style="s2">all-important that can lead to all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.740" end="00:24:22.230" style="s2">of tyrannies and and kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.060" end="00:24:24.570" style="s2">collective ethos sweeping over like 20</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.230" end="00:24:27.860" style="s2">century is like to some degree that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.570" end="00:24:32.250" style="s2">story and there is a need for individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.860" end="00:24:35.010" style="s2">agency within that but there also within</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.250" end="00:24:39.540" style="s2">that that feels like it can become just</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.010" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">very I and Randy and I suppose has this</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.540" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s the individual on there</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:47.010" style="s2">kind of Nietzsche and journey of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:50.100" style="s2">manifestation if it feels very masculine</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.010" end="00:24:52.140" style="s2">male centric and maybe less feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.100" end="00:24:53.220" style="s2">relational and and I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.140" end="00:24:56.549" style="s2">conclusion on that I&#39;m more just</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.220" end="00:24:59.010" style="s2">introducing more frames well for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.549" end="00:25:01.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s an incomplete story the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.010" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">individualism story is for me correct</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.500" end="00:25:05.370" style="s2">but it&#39;s incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">but my sense and this is from personal</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.370" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">growth and my sort of spiritual journey</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:15.090" style="s2">is that by going really really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:17.030" style="s2">into my own process like really</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.090" end="00:25:19.320" style="s2">identifying my own sort of limiting</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.030" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">beliefs on my own kind of conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.320" end="00:25:23.370" style="s2">on my own wounds or whatever kind of and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:28.380" style="s2">as I have fixed those more and more I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.370" end="00:25:30.990" style="s2">feel in increasingly firstly that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.380" end="00:25:32.610" style="s2">more in a position of of contact with</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.990" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">other people like I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.610" end="00:25:36.570" style="s2">catch-22 I think that&#39;s the paradox that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">we start to kind of decide well either</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.570" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">it&#39;s individual or it&#39;s our collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:42.750" style="s2">and we the left prioritizes the group</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:45.330" style="s2">and the right prioritize the individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.750" end="00:25:47.490" style="s2">for me the resolution is no it&#39;s only by</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.330" end="00:25:48.750" style="s2">really individuating really going deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.490" end="00:25:50.730" style="s2">into ourselves and really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.750" end="00:25:53.010" style="s2">becoming ourselves giving birth to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.730" end="00:25:54.900" style="s2">ourselves as jung talked about then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.010" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">have the potential for genuine contact</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.900" end="00:25:59.820" style="s2">and genuine collaboration and if we jump</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:01.169" style="s2">to that space of no we&#39;re all we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.820" end="00:26:03.480" style="s2">part of the tribe we can collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.169" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">together often what comes out is real</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.480" end="00:26:08.040" style="s2">shadow stuff and like it&#39;s that that for</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:09.419" style="s2">me is like the catch-22 we go deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.040" end="00:26:10.590" style="s2">deeply deep into our own process and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.419" end="00:26:12.270" style="s2">then we find we&#39;re all the same person</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.590" end="00:26:14.429" style="s2">looking out through different eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.270" end="00:26:16.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a direct embodied feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.429" end="00:26:18.390" style="s2">connection rather than trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.260" end="00:26:22.160" style="s2">create this disconnection which maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.390" end="00:26:25.380" style="s2">hasn&#39;t manifested naturally yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.160" end="00:26:28.770" style="s2">totally agree with all of that and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.380" end="00:26:31.140" style="s2">think that if we look at this from an</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.770" end="00:26:33.419" style="s2">evolutionary perspective like why has</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.140" end="00:26:33.659" style="s2">Jordan Peterson come on the scene right</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.419" end="00:26:36.030" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.659" end="00:26:37.740" style="s2">why is his message resonated so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.030" end="00:26:40.679" style="s2">I like reject that it&#39;s purely because</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.740" end="00:26:43.110" style="s2">of fragile masculinity and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.679" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">you know the he&#39;s the intellectual we</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.110" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">deserve that&#39;s kind of the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:50.010" style="s2">sentiment on the left i I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:52.290" style="s2">in from an integral perspective it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.010" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">correction of a lower tier that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.290" end="00:26:55.740" style="s2">individual does have to individuate</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:26:57.510" style="s2">because if it just leaps straight to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.740" end="00:27:00.660" style="s2">post-modernism Universal collectivism</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.510" end="00:27:02.460" style="s2">its lost and so I do think that Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.660" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">is a really necessary stage on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.460" end="00:27:07.740" style="s2">journey but we need to move fast and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">need to start in reintegrating that with</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.740" end="00:27:13.500" style="s2">greater and greater I suppose ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:16.950" style="s2">the wholeness both on an individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.500" end="00:27:20.370" style="s2">level but also on a collective and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.950" end="00:27:21.720" style="s2">the danger is that yes we all have to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.370" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">through our individual journey of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.720" end="00:27:26.299" style="s2">self-actualization but because that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.700" end="00:27:29.130" style="s2">takes place within a broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.299" end="00:27:30.780" style="s2">individualistic culture it it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.130" end="00:27:33.450" style="s2">classic critique of spirituality it just</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.780" end="00:27:35.070" style="s2">ends up as narcissism and and again this</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.450" end="00:27:37.320" style="s2">is a point that Jonathan Rosen raised in</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.070" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">his paper is that you know the true self</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.320" end="00:27:43.590" style="s2">actualization is often born out in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:45.390" style="s2">service to community in service to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.590" end="00:27:47.790" style="s2">greater whole that you&#39;re a part of and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.390" end="00:27:49.830" style="s2">as well as the question is does does</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.790" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s narrative orientations</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.830" end="00:27:54.120" style="s2">towards that way do we see it resolving</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:56.660" style="s2">the systemic crisis that we face in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.120" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">world and that&#39;s maybe where I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.660" end="00:28:03.419" style="s2">potentially doesn&#39;t go far enough I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">think he would argue that if enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.419" end="00:28:08.970" style="s2">people got themselves together then</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:11.940" style="s2">those systemic crises would would be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.970" end="00:28:15.480" style="s2">lot easier to solve which I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.940" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">agree with that I also think that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.480" end="00:28:22.380" style="s2">is probably a place beyond him pointing</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">to yeah but I but I really feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.380" end="00:28:29.370" style="s2">can&#39;t jump there and I think most yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:31.860" style="s2">think most of what we&#39;re saying at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.370" end="00:28:33.870" style="s2">moment is it kind of jumping beyond not</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.860" end="00:28:35.940" style="s2">not doing the work not doing the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.870" end="00:28:37.620" style="s2">kind of the deep work of self</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.940" end="00:28:39.390" style="s2">responsibility of really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.620" end="00:28:40.330" style="s2">identifying he send a couple of really</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.390" end="00:28:43.060" style="s2">interesting thing as me</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.330" end="00:28:44.620" style="s2">with me how do you know that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.060" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">avoiding your personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.620" end="00:28:47.260" style="s2">and people on the left go now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:49.240" style="s2">avoiding my personal responsibility said</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.260" end="00:28:51.700" style="s2">how do you know pay really close</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.240" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">attention don&#39;t just dismiss it how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.700" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">you know because personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">is an incredibly difficult thing to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:28:57.990" style="s2">like full personal responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:29:01.030" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve done in your life</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:02.920" style="s2">really and it was a kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.030" end="00:29:06.310" style="s2">interesting moment it&#39;s like yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.920" end="00:29:09.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a lifelong process it is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.310" end="00:29:11.860" style="s2">lifelong process and and also I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.010" end="00:29:13.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s I think that the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.860" end="00:29:15.820" style="s2">need to like fully mature and get to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.870" end="00:29:19.540" style="s2">that place of self-actualization before</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.820" end="00:29:21.940" style="s2">we get to collective issues is a it just</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.540" end="00:29:23.740" style="s2">given where we are in this moment in</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.940" end="00:29:26.170" style="s2">history I think that that&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.740" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">option I think that we do radically need</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.170" end="00:29:31.830" style="s2">to do that inner work and it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:36.010" style="s2">express itself in really tackling global</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.830" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">problems that we face and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.010" end="00:29:39.880" style="s2">that like some credit needs to be given</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">that like it&#39;s easy to characterize the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.880" end="00:29:42.610" style="s2">left as a bunch of materialist who</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:44.230" style="s2">haven&#39;t an inner work but like if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.610" end="00:29:46.840" style="s2">look at people in all circles there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.230" end="00:29:49.510" style="s2">lots of people who are doing lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.840" end="00:29:51.730" style="s2">inner work and they are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.510" end="00:29:54.070" style="s2">broadly left-wing causes and they do can</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.730" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">recognize when a group dynamic is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.070" end="00:30:00.040" style="s2">getting toxic and I do think that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">is a growing constituency that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.040" end="00:30:05.080" style="s2">both and yeah maybe that there is more</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:07.150" style="s2">of an emphasis on the the systems change</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.080" end="00:30:08.980" style="s2">thinking and less on individual work and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.150" end="00:30:11.230" style="s2">they haven&#39;t done a proper self</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.980" end="00:30:12.940" style="s2">examination of their shadow but like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.230" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">know you also have to work with what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.940" end="00:30:19.210" style="s2">have and I think that again I do think</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:21.820" style="s2">that a in the in the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.210" end="00:30:23.650" style="s2">evolution that the individual does and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.820" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">some level need to be recalibrated but</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.650" end="00:30:28.150" style="s2">then it&#39;s like right and then let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:29.770" style="s2">or we will have a pretty shitty context</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.150" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">for the individual to operate in 50</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.770" end="00:30:32.740" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:33.970" style="s2">yeah which is an interesting in one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.740" end="00:30:35.920" style="s2">the interviews we did with Jamie wheel</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.970" end="00:30:38.110" style="s2">he made this comment about but</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.920" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">specifically identity politics because</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.110" end="00:30:44.680" style="s2">he has been involved in these kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:46.750" style="s2">these social change or really big</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.680" end="00:30:50.410" style="s2">projects and what he found was that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.750" end="00:30:52.090" style="s2">got taken down why he was he describes</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.410" end="00:30:53.230" style="s2">it as he was very he assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.090" end="00:30:54.700" style="s2">everyone basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.230" end="00:30:58.090" style="s2">outside the old right was kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.700" end="00:30:59.620" style="s2">okay guy or an okay person until they he</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.090" end="00:31:02.169" style="s2">basically said he was kneecaps from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.620" end="00:31:04.540" style="s2">left which he never expected and it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.169" end="00:31:06.760" style="s2">because the problem with identity</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.540" end="00:31:08.410" style="s2">politics is it stops you from even</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.760" end="00:31:09.730" style="s2">moving forward because if you&#39;re act him</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.410" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">say well we can&#39;t move forward until</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.730" end="00:31:12.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:13.720" style="s2">representation we can&#39;t move forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.040" end="00:31:15.070" style="s2">until we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve made sure that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.720" end="00:31:17.320" style="s2">every single voice is being heard we</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.070" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">can&#39;t move forward until the the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.320" end="00:31:21.100" style="s2">list is endless because the number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:22.600" style="s2">people that would need to be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.100" end="00:31:25.960" style="s2">this particular conversation would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.600" end="00:31:27.309" style="s2">would be astronomical before you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.960" end="00:31:29.530" style="s2">even move forward and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.309" end="00:31:32.200" style="s2">the issue for me on the left is that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.530" end="00:31:34.270" style="s2">have this very toxic worldview when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.200" end="00:31:36.940" style="s2">taken to an extreme that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.270" end="00:31:39.370" style="s2">pretty much kneecapping a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.940" end="00:31:41.799" style="s2">police or tential positive social</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.370" end="00:31:45.610" style="s2">movements so again I agree with you like</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.799" end="00:31:48.460" style="s2">it&#39;s deconstructing by nature its art is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.610" end="00:31:51.880" style="s2">in pointing out the flaws it&#39;s it kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.460" end="00:31:52.929" style="s2">of inimicable to going out there</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.880" end="00:31:54.610" style="s2">initiating there was a really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.929" end="00:31:57.580" style="s2">example of the Swedish initiative which</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.610" end="00:31:59.470" style="s2">was a new political party that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.580" end="00:32:02.200" style="s2">inspired by meta modern thinking The New</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.470" end="00:32:03.940" style="s2">Yorker did a piece on them and they had</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.200" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">just so much promise so many tons of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.940" end="00:32:10.809" style="s2">people and then it just took a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:14.049" style="s2">voices to throw out like somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.809" end="00:32:15.640" style="s2">unsubstantiated accusations of sexist</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.049" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">misogynist behavior and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.640" end="00:32:19.780" style="s2">project was just like torpedoed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:23.169" style="s2">just so easy to do that so I do</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.780" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">recognize that and also that they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.169" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">know identity politics is a spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:30.070" style="s2">there is like really extreme versions</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">that are like that and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.070" end="00:32:33.820" style="s2">mature and thoughtful versions and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:35.530" style="s2">think that like we have plenty of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.820" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">who are really involved in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.530" end="00:32:39.390" style="s2">intersectional activism and identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:41.950" style="s2">politics in our circles and like it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.390" end="00:32:43.980" style="s2">fascinating to to talk to them about</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.950" end="00:32:46.299" style="s2">like what is a mature thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.980" end="00:32:49.990" style="s2">identity politics look like you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.299" end="00:32:52.330" style="s2">even just a simple like shift in</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.990" end="00:32:54.160" style="s2">thinking from calling out to calling in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.330" end="00:32:57.160" style="s2">so there has been a big culture of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.160" end="00:32:59.230" style="s2">calling out you know white male</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.160" end="00:33:02.140" style="s2">privilege which essentially has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.230" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">shaming and you know really negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.140" end="00:33:06.740" style="s2">towards a new culture of in a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.390" style="s2">sensitive way highlighting</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.740" end="00:33:10.040" style="s2">a person&#39;s experience of maybe being</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.390" end="00:33:12.470" style="s2">marginalized in a group setting someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.040" end="00:33:15.559" style="s2">taking up too much space and calling it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.470" end="00:33:20.059" style="s2">in so like this I think also it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.559" end="00:33:22.790" style="s2">easy to have this particular extreme</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.059" end="00:33:25.520" style="s2">caricature of identity politics and also</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.790" end="00:33:27.290" style="s2">not to forget that it&#39;s it serves the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.520" end="00:33:29.890" style="s2">interest from my perspective for someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">on the left it serves the interests of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.890" end="00:33:33.800" style="s2">people who are on the far-right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.720" style="s2">fascists for more and more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.800" end="00:33:37.670" style="s2">us to have this extreme caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.720" end="00:33:39.410" style="s2">identity politics and therefore to</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.670" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">dismiss it inside line it and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.410" end="00:33:43.700" style="s2">have to be very careful about when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.350" style="s2">talking about an identity politics just</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.700" end="00:33:46.790" style="s2">to arts as at least to honor that there</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.350" end="00:33:48.140" style="s2">is a spectrum so yeah I thought you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.790" end="00:33:50.120" style="s2">gonna make a different point there which</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.140" end="00:33:52.910" style="s2">is the identity politics serves the far</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.120" end="00:33:55.100" style="s2">right and because I think it does is</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.910" end="00:33:57.559" style="s2">this is a problem what I mean basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.100" end="00:33:59.240" style="s2">the left is creating a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.559" end="00:34:01.280" style="s2">they&#39;re making your group identity the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.240" end="00:34:03.530" style="s2">most important thing about you and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.280" end="00:34:05.720" style="s2">is going to happen is the far the far</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.530" end="00:34:07.190" style="s2">right are gonna say well okay then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.720" end="00:34:08.840" style="s2">play identity politics and we&#39;ll win</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.190" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">because there&#39;s more of us this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.840" end="00:34:13.399" style="s2">terrifying yeah so I agree that that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">does fuel the right and the right plays</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.399" end="00:34:18.109" style="s2">on that by highlighting the caricature</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:20.690" style="s2">that more and more kind of mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.109" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">soft left liberal groups are now</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.690" end="00:34:23.300" style="s2">identifying with like I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:26.169" style="s2">was a real culture a moment when</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.300" end="00:34:30.350" style="s2">Jonathan PI did his four-minute</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.169" end="00:34:31.790" style="s2">brilliant comedy piece on identity</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.350" end="00:34:34.220" style="s2">politics and you know there was that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.790" end="00:34:37.250" style="s2">collective yes we can finally rip the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.220" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2"> out of this you know but also you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.250" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">know underneath it is like decades of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:46.280" style="s2">genuine analysis about the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:49.149" style="s2">people experience advantage and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.280" end="00:34:50.869" style="s2">disadvantage and we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.149" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">throwing the baby out with the bathwater</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.869" end="00:34:54.470" style="s2">you&#39;re really considering that very</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:56.840" style="s2">carefully because it&#39;s very easy to wade</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.470" end="00:34:59.270" style="s2">in with very little understanding take</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.840" end="00:35:00.590" style="s2">this kind of caricature and then go when</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.270" end="00:35:03.140" style="s2">you know the left needs to get his house</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.590" end="00:35:06.380" style="s2">in order and I think that that is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.140" end="00:35:08.540" style="s2">but I I mean I think of sort of Eric and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.380" end="00:35:11.270" style="s2">Brett Weinstein because they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.540" end="00:35:12.710" style="s2">both Bernie Sanders supporters very kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.270" end="00:35:14.780" style="s2">of interesting thoughts about the left</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.710" end="00:35:17.450" style="s2">first thing I&#39;d sort of reframe it and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.780" end="00:35:18.599" style="s2">think if Pete if Peterson talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.450" end="00:35:20.579" style="s2">it like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.599" end="00:35:21.960" style="s2">I think people would understand his kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.579" end="00:35:24.599" style="s2">of critiques of identity politics a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.960" end="00:35:27.630" style="s2">little bit better it&#39;s like it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.599" end="00:35:30.269" style="s2">like equality fairness is a good value</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.630" end="00:35:33.269" style="s2">if you make it your primary axiom it</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.269" end="00:35:34.799" style="s2">leads to madness which is what Eric</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.269" end="00:35:36.509" style="s2">Weinstein said it&#39;s like you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.799" end="00:35:38.729" style="s2">build a cosmology out of a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.509" end="00:35:40.710" style="s2">oppression it leads to insanity which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.729" end="00:35:42.210" style="s2">which is I think a good way of pulling</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.710" end="00:35:43.470" style="s2">it apart like know these values that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.210" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">hold they are good they are valuable</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.470" end="00:35:47.150" style="s2">they need to be part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:49.499" style="s2">if you make them your primary axioms</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.150" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen what happens in history it</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.499" end="00:35:55.470" style="s2">generally turns into turns into hell on</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:56.910" style="s2">earth but the other point like I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.470" end="00:35:58.769" style="s2">say the left does need to get its house</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.910" end="00:36:00.450" style="s2">in order like I said I think what we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.769" end="00:36:02.309" style="s2">seeing at the moment is a kind of civil</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.450" end="00:36:05.009" style="s2">war within the left where we had this</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.309" end="00:36:07.049" style="s2">kind of oppression narrative taking over</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.009" end="00:36:08.460" style="s2">until it&#39;s the only dialogue in town so</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.049" end="00:36:09.960" style="s2">I do actually think that the left does</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.460" end="00:36:12.059" style="s2">need to put its house in order and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.960" end="00:36:14.220" style="s2">think that&#39;s the healing that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.059" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">happen like it really does need to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.220" end="00:36:19.140" style="s2">which is why I think what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:20.609" style="s2">as well with the with kind of making</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.140" end="00:36:22.170" style="s2">films about Jordan Peters and saying how</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.609" end="00:36:23.789" style="s2">something useful to offer the left is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.170" end="00:36:25.229" style="s2">really valuable conversation to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.789" end="00:36:27.989" style="s2">yeah so I agree the left doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.229" end="00:36:30.210" style="s2">get its house in order and maybe again</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.989" end="00:36:32.579" style="s2">bring in the principle of the frame you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.210" end="00:36:35.009" style="s2">brought in at the beginning which is how</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.579" end="00:36:37.589" style="s2">do we include and transcend rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.009" end="00:36:39.569" style="s2">rejecting and I do think it does involve</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.589" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">doing the work of really listening to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.569" end="00:36:45.210" style="s2">that experience and and and and honoring</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:47.670" style="s2">not just the caricature but actually the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.210" end="00:36:49.499" style="s2">real genuine analysis and genuine</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.670" end="00:36:53.700" style="s2">sentiment that&#39;s there while also</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.499" end="00:36:55.979" style="s2">recognizing it is hostile to like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.700" end="00:36:58.859" style="s2">genuine empirically driven intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.979" end="00:36:59.640" style="s2">inquiry it is a divisive narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.859" end="00:37:01.829" style="s2">had to pits</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.640" end="00:37:03.719" style="s2">everyone as oppressors and oppressed it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.829" end="00:37:05.819" style="s2">is an individualizing narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.719" end="00:37:08.099" style="s2">balkanized as political groups like all</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.819" end="00:37:10.140" style="s2">of those things are deeply problematic</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.099" end="00:37:14.999" style="s2">if we want to bring people on board a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.140" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">vision of transition we share a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.999" end="00:37:20.940" style="s2">focus on sort of spiritual development</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:22.410" style="s2">as sort of politics through sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.940" end="00:37:24.479" style="s2">spiritual lens and through a personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.410" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">growth personal development lens and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.479" end="00:37:28.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve often thought that kind of and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:30.520" style="s2">I guess we both share a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.529" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">skepticism towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.520" end="00:37:34.540" style="s2">realism like I have a real skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.460" style="s2">towards materialism I think it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.540" end="00:37:38.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a really sort of it saps the soul</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.460" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">out of the world and I think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.170" end="00:37:41.290" style="s2">ultimately I think is what we&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:43.090" style="s2">the crisis we&#39;re seeing at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.290" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">a crisis of materialism it&#39;s a crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.090" end="00:37:49.270" style="s2">all of these kind of things falling</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:51.460" style="s2">apart at the same time and implicit for</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.270" end="00:37:53.470" style="s2">me and what Peterson is saying is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.460" end="00:37:55.240" style="s2">acknowledgment of that and it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.470" end="00:37:56.980" style="s2">of like a lot of the Krait the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.240" end="00:37:58.660" style="s2">intractable social crises that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.980" end="00:38:00.940" style="s2">seeing say I use the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.660" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">opioid crisis in America where you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.940" end="00:38:04.840" style="s2">an incredible number of people like self</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:06.670" style="s2">numbing because they can&#39;t for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.840" end="00:38:08.470" style="s2">like it&#39;s the MOT it&#39;s the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.670" end="00:38:10.780" style="s2">emptiness of late-stage capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.470" end="00:38:13.480" style="s2">that&#39;s making a lot of our social crises</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.780" end="00:38:15.130" style="s2">worse and I think implicit in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.480" end="00:38:16.930" style="s2">what Peterson is saying is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.130" end="00:38:19.840" style="s2">acknowledgment of that and I think if he</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.930" end="00:38:21.160" style="s2">was to make that explicit and say yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.840" end="00:38:24.010" style="s2">lot of the crises we&#39;re seeing our</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.160" end="00:38:26.170" style="s2">spiritual crises not Material crises</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.010" end="00:38:28.360" style="s2">material the material realm is actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.170" end="00:38:32.110" style="s2">a subset of the the realm of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.360" end="00:38:33.790" style="s2">and the realm of the being and he does</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.110" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">believe that because I asked him and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.790" end="00:38:38.200" style="s2">said yes but he doesn&#39;t say that and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:40.510" style="s2">think if he was to say that if he was to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.200" end="00:38:42.220" style="s2">frame his message in that way I think a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.510" end="00:38:46.090" style="s2">lot of people on the progressive left</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.220" end="00:38:47.740" style="s2">would suddenly say he he is saying the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.090" end="00:38:49.660" style="s2">same thing that we&#39;re saying because I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.740" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">think he is but I think he&#39;s got so</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.660" end="00:38:53.860" style="s2">caught into this reactivity against</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:55.870" style="s2">identity politics that a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.860" end="00:38:57.190" style="s2">he could be saying that would allow more</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.870" end="00:39:00.700" style="s2">people to see him as now lying I</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.190" end="00:39:02.080" style="s2">swallowed up and a way that you know do</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.700" end="00:39:03.790" style="s2">you resonate with that do you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.080" end="00:39:04.900" style="s2">that&#39;s that would you if he said that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.790" end="00:39:07.000" style="s2">would that be something you&#39;d agree with</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.900" end="00:39:08.920" style="s2">yeah I would absolutely resonate with it</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.000" end="00:39:10.450" style="s2">like well this is one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.920" end="00:39:12.610" style="s2">we compared him and contrasted with</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.450" end="00:39:13.750" style="s2">Russell Brand this is essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.610" end="00:39:16.030" style="s2">message of Russell Brand has been</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.750" end="00:39:17.740" style="s2">bringing Russell Brand when he gave that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.030" end="00:39:19.630" style="s2">famous interview with Jeremy Paxman was</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.740" end="00:39:20.860" style="s2">saying I&#39;m not voting because actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.630" end="00:39:23.470" style="s2">what we need is a spiritual revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.860" end="00:39:25.300" style="s2">and he talks again and again about how</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.470" end="00:39:27.100" style="s2">our society makes us addicted makes us</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.300" end="00:39:29.590" style="s2">mentally and well and keeps us from</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.100" end="00:39:31.990" style="s2">flourishing like that is the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.590" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">political diagnosis for me but I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.990" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">think that to rectify that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:41.110" style="s2">certain amount of material conditions</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">that need to be there that does require</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.110" end="00:39:45.420" style="s2">what might be deemed as</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.890" style="s2">progressive adjustments to policy to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.420" end="00:39:49.500" style="s2">things like equality and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.890" end="00:39:51.420" style="s2">potentially where let&#39;s say more people</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.500" end="00:39:54.420" style="s2">on the left or me and Peterson would</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.420" end="00:39:56.910" style="s2">diverge and and and maybe we can watch</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:59.730" style="s2">this and then we can analyze that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.910" end="00:40:01.620" style="s2">afterwards and the sticking point that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.730" end="00:40:03.630" style="s2">hear a lot from my sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.620" end="00:40:05.400" style="s2">progressive friends is you all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.630" end="00:40:07.110" style="s2">primary focus is on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.400" end="00:40:08.850" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s too bad for them</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.110" end="00:40:11.700" style="s2">because the primary focus should be on</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.850" end="00:40:14.700" style="s2">you know I can agree with that but what</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.700" end="00:40:16.890" style="s2">I the the paradox that they would say</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.700" end="00:40:19.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay focus on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.890" end="00:40:21.360" style="s2">but you have to accept that there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.200" end="00:40:23.370" style="s2">some situations that are much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.360" end="00:40:25.290" style="s2">conducive to an individual thriving than</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.370" end="00:40:27.390" style="s2">other situations and so their focus is</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.290" end="00:40:29.070" style="s2">on structural inequality your focus is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.390" end="00:40:30.840" style="s2">on the individual is there not some</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.070" end="00:40:32.970" style="s2">interplay between oh definitely well</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.840" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">obviously because people do have group</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.970" end="00:40:37.650" style="s2">identities the question is whether</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:39.780" style="s2">whether the group or the individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.650" end="00:40:41.790" style="s2">identity should be paramount and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.780" end="00:40:45.240" style="s2">left distanc the radical leftist answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.790" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">is well there is the look it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.240" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">that&#39;s failing to take into account</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.580" style="s2">those two levels of analysis it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:53.490" style="s2">bloody radical leftist because for them</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.580" end="00:40:56.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the collective and that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.490" end="00:40:59.580" style="s2">so it&#39;s obvious as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.760" end="00:41:01.290" style="s2">that people have their individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.580" end="00:41:03.360" style="s2">then behind that they have there they</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:05.010" style="s2">have their group by multiple group</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.360" end="00:41:07.140" style="s2">identities which is also a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.010" end="00:41:08.520" style="s2">but all separately or any of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.140" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">situations that make it much more</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.520" end="00:41:12.120" style="s2">difficult for people to self actualize</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:14.220" style="s2">well what I think they&#39;d argue is they</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.120" end="00:41:15.720" style="s2">don&#39;t hear you talk about that very much</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.220" end="00:41:18.090" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t first of all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.720" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">self-evident like I&#39;m not I don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.090" end="00:41:22.020" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:23.220" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessarily more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.020" end="00:41:25.260" style="s2">for people who are poor to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.220" end="00:41:27.780" style="s2">self-actualize sorry I don&#39;t buy that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.260" end="00:41:29.400" style="s2">you because what that would mean think</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:31.740" style="s2">about what that would mean that would</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.400" end="00:41:34.890" style="s2">mean that the rich are morally superior</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.740" end="00:41:36.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what that means because they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.890" end="00:41:39.120" style="s2">all the opportunities to self actualize</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.600" end="00:41:40.140" style="s2">so obviously if the material conditions</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.120" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">are the prerequisite for</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.140" end="00:41:44.010" style="s2">self-actualization then the rich are</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:45.660" style="s2">morally superior to the poor is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.010" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">really an argument we want to make and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.660" end="00:41:51.060" style="s2">in fact I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">even vaguely reasonable because one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.060" end="00:41:56.910" style="s2">the things that does help build</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:42:00.540" style="s2">character is privation now obvious</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.910" end="00:42:01.380" style="s2">starving to death is an an excess of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.540" end="00:42:05.880" style="s2">privation</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.380" end="00:42:08.369" style="s2">so there are limit conditions but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.880" end="00:42:10.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a leftist trope that the provision</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.369" end="00:42:12.450" style="s2">of additional material resources will</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.440" end="00:42:13.230" style="s2">produce ethically superior human beings</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.450" end="00:42:16.290" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.230" end="00:42:17.360" style="s2">not true and in fact sometimes quite the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.290" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">contrary</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.360" end="00:42:24.840" style="s2">so-so so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">that argument in the least I also think</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.840" end="00:42:30.690" style="s2">that under most circumstances accepting</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.900" end="00:42:33.180" style="s2">those of exceptional privation and even</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.690" end="00:42:38.070" style="s2">perhaps under those conditions in most</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.180" end="00:42:40.260" style="s2">is in most cases your best bet to move</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.070" end="00:42:41.580" style="s2">people forward is to concentrate on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.260" end="00:42:43.530" style="s2">development of their individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.580" end="00:42:45.900" style="s2">character and their individual their</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.530" end="00:42:48.150" style="s2">individual moral character fund because</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.900" end="00:42:50.340" style="s2">moral character is actually your moral</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.150" end="00:42:52.320" style="s2">character is actually the set of tools</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.340" end="00:42:54.150" style="s2">that you have to operate effectively in</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.320" end="00:42:56.940" style="s2">the world because otherwise morality</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.150" end="00:42:59.790" style="s2">would be of no utility and morality is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.940" end="00:43:04.170" style="s2">in some sense precisely that way which</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.790" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">is of maximal utility and so and and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.170" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">other objection that I would throw it at</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.760" end="00:43:11.270" style="s2">the radical left is how do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:14.910" style="s2">your Oh your emphasis on collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.270" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">existence isn&#39;t just an abdication of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.910" end="00:43:19.230" style="s2">your personal responsibility well of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:22.530" style="s2">course it&#39;s not it&#39;s like no no no</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.230" end="00:43:25.560" style="s2">seriously here it&#39;s not that easy to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.530" end="00:43:28.050" style="s2">adopt personal responsibility maximal</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.560" end="00:43:30.210" style="s2">personal responsibility what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.050" end="00:43:33.540" style="s2">think you&#39;re not running away from it</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.210" end="00:43:36.540" style="s2">you have every reason to you really have</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.540" end="00:43:38.550" style="s2">that stellar moral character really</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.540" end="00:43:40.859" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s your self analysis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.550" end="00:43:42.420" style="s2">like sorry I don&#39;t buy it and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.859" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">especially don&#39;t buy it when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.420" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">the consequences of leftist revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:49.530" style="s2">because all these people of stellar</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:52.350" style="s2">moral character when they undertake</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.530" end="00:43:54.180" style="s2">their collectivist revolution nothing</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.350" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">comes out of that but absolute bloody</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.180" end="00:44:02.609" style="s2">catastrophe so so all the well-meaning</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:05.730" style="s2">aims aside I found this really</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.609" end="00:44:09.450" style="s2">interesting because implicit I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.730" end="00:44:11.010" style="s2">even and it really landed for me when</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.450" end="00:44:12.510" style="s2">Peterson made this comparison with</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.010" end="00:44:14.070" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.510" end="00:44:16.290" style="s2">kind of the simplified way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.070" end="00:44:18.600" style="s2">okay once you&#39;ve got your material needs</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.290" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">set then you can move up to your social</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.600" end="00:44:22.140" style="s2">needs and then the top is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">self-actualization so we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.140" end="00:44:24.870" style="s2">saying you need to have many of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:26.850" style="s2">other things put together before you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.870" end="00:44:28.830" style="s2">move to self-actualization and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.850" end="00:44:29.880" style="s2">was challenging that and saying no</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.830" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">because then what you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.880" end="00:44:35.250" style="s2">saying is self-actualization like moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.930" style="s2">virtue more all kind of yeah moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.250" end="00:44:38.790" style="s2">virtue is only available to people at</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.930" end="00:44:40.170" style="s2">the top of society which I&#39;d never heard</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.790" end="00:44:42.180" style="s2">before and actually kind of floored me</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.170" end="00:44:45.810" style="s2">when I heard it what did you make of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.180" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">well I think that he is right that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.810" end="00:44:50.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we give everyone we make</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.350" style="s2">society more material equally equal and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.970" end="00:44:54.090" style="s2">then all of a sudden everyone is self</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.350" end="00:44:58.700" style="s2">actualizing that&#39;s that&#39;s simply not</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.090" end="00:45:01.950" style="s2">true very wealthy sectors of society</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.700" end="00:45:03.960" style="s2">constant development as much as very</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.950" end="00:45:06.330" style="s2">poor area of society because they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.960" end="00:45:10.110" style="s2">cultures in a way that are inimical to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.330" end="00:45:12.090" style="s2">to growth so I would say that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.110" end="00:45:14.900" style="s2">an either/or it&#39;s about it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.090" end="00:45:17.310" style="s2">understanding the optimal level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.900" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">support and of challenge both of those</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.310" end="00:45:21.420" style="s2">things are really important so people</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:24.540" style="s2">who are in potentially more deprived</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.420" end="00:45:26.040" style="s2">settings might have adversity that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.540" end="00:45:27.960" style="s2">hugely character-building</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.040" end="00:45:28.920" style="s2">but if it&#39;s too much adversity if</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.960" end="00:45:30.930" style="s2">literally there isn&#39;t just an</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.920" end="00:45:33.630" style="s2">overwhelming set of constraints and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.930" end="00:45:36.300" style="s2">individual it far from inducing growth</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.630" end="00:45:38.310" style="s2">it can be suboptimal for any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.300" end="00:45:41.490" style="s2">development I think that there&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.310" end="00:45:46.430" style="s2">with a spiritual progressive political</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.490" end="00:45:50.550" style="s2">critique of this is the idea that we do</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.430" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">need more material conditions for really</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.550" end="00:45:54.270" style="s2">spiritually and psychologically growing</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.460" style="s2">a lot of them are just around having the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.270" end="00:45:58.740" style="s2">time and the space and the freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.460" end="00:46:00.270" style="s2">reflect on ourselves even just to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.740" end="00:46:02.220" style="s2">able to do courses like I think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.270" end="00:46:03.600" style="s2">like some of the core things that have</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.220" end="00:46:06.210" style="s2">made a difference to my development</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.600" end="00:46:09.240" style="s2">doing of a pasta that&#39;s a 10-day</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.210" end="00:46:12.150" style="s2">meditation that is a luxury if you are</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.240" end="00:46:13.770" style="s2">working on a minimum wage in two jobs to</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.150" end="00:46:15.060" style="s2">take ten days off if you&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.770" end="00:46:17.460" style="s2">children that is a complete privilege</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.060" end="00:46:19.470" style="s2">and luxury of time and space and in an</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.460" end="00:46:21.510" style="s2">ayahuasca ceremony in Peru that is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.470" end="00:46:23.340" style="s2">complete luxury of having enough money</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.510" end="00:46:25.260" style="s2">to fly to the other side</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.340" end="00:46:27.420" style="s2">the world for ayahuasca is legal and do</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.260" end="00:46:30.110" style="s2">it there so I think that like there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.420" end="00:46:32.310" style="s2">if we think about in our spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.110" end="00:46:34.320" style="s2">progressive culture it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.310" end="00:46:36.450" style="s2">privileged space it&#39;s a very it&#39;s does</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.320" end="00:46:38.610" style="s2">all of these workshops that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.450" end="00:46:40.920" style="s2">from shadow work to Tantra all of which</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.610" end="00:46:43.560" style="s2">cost an arm and leg to most people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.920" end="00:46:47.550" style="s2">that is a that is a purely material</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.560" end="00:46:49.820" style="s2">material barrier to entry to higher</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.550" end="00:46:51.990" style="s2">levels of development and growth and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.820" end="00:46:54.570" style="s2">for me that&#39;s where that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.990" end="00:46:56.730" style="s2">comes from is that if you if you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.570" end="00:46:59.160" style="s2">yes 12 out what you want to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.730" end="00:47:01.560" style="s2">in your life as well yeah there is there</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.160" end="00:47:03.570" style="s2">is individual agency and that and if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.560" end="00:47:06.300" style="s2">really really do want to grow you could</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.570" end="00:47:07.980" style="s2">be in any place and you could get to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.300" end="00:47:12.390" style="s2">better place and I think Peterson does</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.980" end="00:47:16.320" style="s2">talk about how we use our social context</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.390" end="00:47:17.850" style="s2">our culture our societies as an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.320" end="00:47:20.580" style="s2">to actually like get your</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.850" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">together like do it but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.580" end="00:47:24.630" style="s2">if we&#39;re thinking about a society how do</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.610" style="s2">we like to run society we would like</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.630" end="00:47:28.590" style="s2">like for us an alter ego we our vision</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.610" end="00:47:31.620" style="s2">is a deliberately developmental Society</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.590" end="00:47:34.020" style="s2">all institutions from family community</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.620" end="00:47:36.900" style="s2">health service legal justice system the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.020" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">economy itself is geared towards the</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.900" end="00:47:40.920" style="s2">development of the self does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:43.110" style="s2">that we radically redistribute everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.920" end="00:47:45.090" style="s2">so ever it has the same well no if the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.110" end="00:47:47.370" style="s2">empirical research proved for peterson</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.090" end="00:47:49.320" style="s2">is saying which is that that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.370" end="00:47:51.060" style="s2">correct conditions but not a materialist</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.060" end="00:47:54.350" style="s2">on that i&#39;m saying that there if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:47:56.700" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about distributing</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.350" end="00:47:58.530" style="s2">material goods it is a degree that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.700" end="00:48:01.320" style="s2">think that there does need to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.530" end="00:48:03.540" style="s2">certain material threshold to give</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.540" end="00:48:07.320" style="s2">bingham but basic income or something</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.250" end="00:48:09.720" style="s2">like that yeah that that might be an</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.320" end="00:48:11.460" style="s2">example like it&#39;s it&#39;s used as an</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.720" end="00:48:13.110" style="s2">example of how it helps with job</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.460" end="00:48:15.390" style="s2">matching in the economy where people</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.110" end="00:48:18.330" style="s2">just have more time and space to go hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.390" end="00:48:20.370" style="s2">what&#39;s the next best move do i go for</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.330" end="00:48:22.290" style="s2">this job or do i take some education</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.370" end="00:48:24.810" style="s2">whereas currently there is literally no</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.290" end="00:48:27.530" style="s2">time and space you just get the next job</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.810" end="00:48:30.210" style="s2">if you&#39;re in a lower rung of society so</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.530" end="00:48:31.620" style="s2">you know progressive employment law the</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.620" end="00:48:40.350" style="s2">it as do you have cognitive bandwidth to</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.590" end="00:48:44.490" style="s2">engage in deeper levels of inquiry to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.350" end="00:48:47.790" style="s2">engage in your own development it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.490" end="00:48:50.220" style="s2">so and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a hopefully a yes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.790" end="00:48:51.930" style="s2">or a both and it&#39;s saying for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.220" end="00:48:54.180" style="s2">spiritual and psychological growth as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.930" end="00:48:56.670" style="s2">priority there is a material dimension</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.180" end="00:48:59.250" style="s2">that requires a progressive politics to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.670" end="00:49:01.050" style="s2">really challenge particularly vested</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.250" end="00:49:02.730" style="s2">interests that are hoarding lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.050" end="00:49:08.460" style="s2">money and that needs to be distributed</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.730" end="00:49:10.050" style="s2">I guess my perspective would be but what</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.460" end="00:49:12.780" style="s2">came up when I was hearing you talk was</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.050" end="00:49:15.930" style="s2">just a sort of sense that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.780" end="00:49:17.790" style="s2">the blocks there&#39;s what what I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.930" end="00:49:20.280" style="s2">hearing was a certain kind of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.790" end="00:49:21.930" style="s2">if we just gave people enough space they</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.280" end="00:49:23.880" style="s2">would make better decisions I have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.930" end="00:49:25.770" style="s2">sense that the kind of the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.880" end="00:49:29.100" style="s2">traps that we create for ourselves are</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.770" end="00:49:32.940" style="s2">often much deeper than that and so for</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.100" end="00:49:34.860" style="s2">me I guess the sort of going beyond like</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.940" end="00:49:36.870" style="s2">like I think Peterson&#39;s focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.860" end="00:49:39.600" style="s2">individual is absolutely necessary like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.870" end="00:49:40.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s the right place to start and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.600" end="00:49:43.080" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to have a set of axioms</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.890" end="00:49:45.060" style="s2">empowering the individual and starting</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.080" end="00:49:48.440" style="s2">from a place of like radical personal</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.060" end="00:49:50.250" style="s2">responsibility or radical kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.440" end="00:49:51.930" style="s2">self-awareness and there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.250" end="00:49:54.210" style="s2">humility as well I really like about</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.930" end="00:49:56.700" style="s2">Peterson as well if there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.210" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">humility in accepting you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.700" end="00:50:00.420" style="s2">that what you don&#39;t know is as important</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:01.650" style="s2">as what you do in a real sense of kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.420" end="00:50:03.600" style="s2">of respect for that which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:04.860" style="s2">really valuable compared to like for</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.600" end="00:50:06.570" style="s2">example the sam Harris&#39;s or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.860" end="00:50:07.500" style="s2">materialists which is sort of like no we</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.570" end="00:50:09.000" style="s2">know everything oh we can work</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.500" end="00:50:10.920" style="s2">everything out so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.000" end="00:50:12.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of starting point I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.920" end="00:50:15.000" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s the right place to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.450" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">start I think what&#39;s really helped me is</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.000" end="00:50:21.420" style="s2">like personal growth didn&#39;t get quite so</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:23.070" style="s2">much Maya Wesker but but definitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.420" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">there are there are things that I got a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.070" end="00:50:27.360" style="s2">lot a lot from in terms of personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:29.100" style="s2">growth and therapeutic interventions and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.360" end="00:50:33.180" style="s2">I think giving people that is really</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.100" end="00:50:35.490" style="s2">important I know for example my I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.180" end="00:50:37.440" style="s2">digress slightly my mother and my father</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.490" end="00:50:39.510" style="s2">had very I was I was brought up in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:42.570" style="s2">very left-wing house my father was very</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.510" end="00:50:43.980" style="s2">sort of straight down the line Guardium</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.570" end="00:50:45.100" style="s2">Reid they both read The Guardian they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.980" end="00:50:49.030" style="s2">both sort of Guardian Reid</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.100" end="00:50:52.360" style="s2">see nd marching people my mum went</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.030" end="00:50:54.310" style="s2">through a process of real difficulty she</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.360" end="00:50:56.380" style="s2">started working in a in a poor school in</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.310" end="00:50:58.090" style="s2">Southampton and what she found really</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.380" end="00:51:00.580" style="s2">difficult so she had a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.090" end="00:51:03.730" style="s2">interactions with the actual like they</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.580" end="00:51:06.370" style="s2">both wanted to help the downtrodden the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.730" end="00:51:08.020" style="s2">the poor what in my dad in a very sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.370" end="00:51:09.610" style="s2">of abstract way my mum in our very real</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.020" end="00:51:11.380" style="s2">kind of working in one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.610" end="00:51:14.560" style="s2">deprived areas and schools in</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.380" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">Southampton she had something of a of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.560" end="00:51:21.700" style="s2">real awakening because what she realized</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:23.260" style="s2">was that a lot of the parents didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.700" end="00:51:25.660" style="s2">necessarily want their kids to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.260" end="00:51:28.120" style="s2">or not on a subconscious level not not</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.660" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">outwardly but she would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.120" end="00:51:31.450" style="s2">seeing something in this child like wow</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:33.100" style="s2">you could really clear at the University</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.450" end="00:51:38.560" style="s2">and the parents would come in and like</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.100" end="00:51:40.930" style="s2">no the system&#39;s biased no my child none</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.560" end="00:51:42.700" style="s2">of us have been to university and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.930" end="00:51:45.670" style="s2">really found this kind of like either</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.700" end="00:51:49.090" style="s2">either either conscious or subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.670" end="00:51:50.500" style="s2">like because if their child succeeded it</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.090" end="00:51:52.210" style="s2">would challenge them set their Center</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.500" end="00:51:53.950" style="s2">themselves the fact that the system was</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.210" end="00:51:55.390" style="s2">biased against them the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.950" end="00:51:57.190" style="s2">world didn&#39;t work for people like them</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.390" end="00:52:00.700" style="s2">all this stuff and it happens it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.190" end="00:52:03.490" style="s2">a subconscious level and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.700" end="00:52:05.650" style="s2">see is the real difficulty with like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.490" end="00:52:07.210" style="s2">real value of psychological growth and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.650" end="00:52:08.710" style="s2">real sort of psychological intervention</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.210" end="00:52:11.050" style="s2">is that it can potentially shift some of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.710" end="00:52:13.270" style="s2">those paradigms but the real difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.050" end="00:52:15.970" style="s2">and the real problem with the left is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.270" end="00:52:18.580" style="s2">that it equates poverty or oppression</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.970" end="00:52:20.830" style="s2">with moral virtue and that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.580" end="00:52:22.810" style="s2">issue because if you do that what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.830" end="00:52:24.220" style="s2">don&#39;t realize and that the paradox that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.810" end="00:52:25.750" style="s2">most people on the left is that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.220" end="00:52:27.700" style="s2">love the poor in the abstract but they</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.750" end="00:52:29.110" style="s2">hate them in the particular and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:30.760" style="s2">hate everything they believe they hate</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.110" end="00:52:32.260" style="s2">before than they think they hate the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.760" end="00:52:35.550" style="s2">nationalism they hate all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.260" end="00:52:37.900" style="s2">they actually think so it&#39;s like for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.550" end="00:52:40.360" style="s2">for me I think we all have our shadows</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.900" end="00:52:41.620" style="s2">and I think the shadow of like what</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.360" end="00:52:43.570" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing at the moment with brexit</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.620" end="00:52:45.160" style="s2">and Trump is the shadow of liberalism is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.570" end="00:52:46.840" style="s2">like the shadow of yeah we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.160" end="00:52:48.760" style="s2">inclusive apart from all these people we</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.840" end="00:52:50.770" style="s2">hate so for me the psychological growth</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.760" end="00:52:54.100" style="s2">work needs to happen everywhere I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.770" end="00:52:57.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t see I I think we all have our</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.100" end="00:52:58.760" style="s2">psychological traps in in every area of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.180" end="00:52:59.870" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.760" end="00:53:01.310" style="s2">the Liberals have their psychological</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.870" end="00:53:03.740" style="s2">traps in it&#39;s now coming to bite them in</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.310" end="00:53:06.680" style="s2">the ass with with with brexit and Trump</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.740" end="00:53:08.030" style="s2">and and there are yeah so I see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.680" end="00:53:09.590" style="s2">more complex thing and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.030" end="00:53:12.020" style="s2">message of personal responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.590" end="00:53:15.110" style="s2">really really identify your resentments</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.020" end="00:53:17.030" style="s2">really do the work of really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.110" end="00:53:18.860" style="s2">where you&#39;re where you&#39;re holding back</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.030" end="00:53:20.840" style="s2">or where you&#39;re judging people or where</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.860" end="00:53:22.370" style="s2">and we all have this I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.840" end="00:53:23.630" style="s2">right place to start for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.370" end="00:53:26.120" style="s2">I still think Peterson is the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.630" end="00:53:27.170" style="s2">place to start because if you don&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.120" end="00:53:28.610" style="s2">your shadows are gonna be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.170" end="00:53:31.070" style="s2">manifest in everything that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.610" end="00:53:33.860" style="s2">yeah and I think that maybe what I hear</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.070" end="00:53:35.780" style="s2">in that what you&#39;re saying is that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.860" end="00:53:39.590" style="s2">and Peterson is saying as well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.780" end="00:53:41.900" style="s2">just throw money at a culture of you</p>

<p begin="00:53:41.900" end="00:53:45.530" style="s2">taking personal responsibility it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.430" end="00:53:47.390" style="s2">just continue you and I can and how do</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.530" end="00:53:48.650" style="s2">you actually intervene at any level</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.390" end="00:53:49.640" style="s2">whether it&#39;s like a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.650" end="00:53:52.490" style="s2">underachievement</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.640" end="00:53:54.620" style="s2">in poorer parts of society if it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.490" end="00:53:56.930" style="s2">a culture of moral superiority in</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.620" end="00:53:59.420" style="s2">liberal circles but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.930" end="00:54:00.860" style="s2">maybe the future isn&#39;t is a combination</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.420" end="00:54:03.790" style="s2">of both so I&#39;ll just give you a just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.860" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">practical example in the RSA wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.790" end="00:54:08.900" style="s2">report on basic income and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.790" style="s2">just getting like the actual numbers</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.900" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">right about how much to distribute it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.790" end="00:54:16.340" style="s2">was also putting together a conditional</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:19.160" style="s2">response mechanism where people would</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.340" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">voluntarily contribute in the community</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.160" end="00:54:23.270" style="s2">in society in exchange for the money so</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:24.710" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.270" end="00:54:26.090" style="s2">going to get the money until you do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.710" end="00:54:27.890" style="s2">but there was a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.090" end="00:54:29.840" style="s2">interventions that would create the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.890" end="00:54:32.120" style="s2">conditions for people to more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.840" end="00:54:35.240" style="s2">experience a kind of a more service</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.120" end="00:54:37.310" style="s2">orientated citizenship led identity in</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.240" end="00:54:38.990" style="s2">the absence of work in the future where</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.310" end="00:54:41.870" style="s2">there&#39;s full automation so I do think</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.990" end="00:54:43.880" style="s2">that maybe there is a sort of generosity</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.870" end="00:54:45.590" style="s2">and boundaries at the same time which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.880" end="00:54:48.200" style="s2">a the issue that we often now</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.590" end="00:54:50.600" style="s2">yeah and and and and again but I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.200" end="00:54:52.130" style="s2">think you can have a you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.600" end="00:54:54.080" style="s2">for example a welfare state that really</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.130" end="00:54:56.330" style="s2">emphasizes psychological growth work</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.080" end="00:54:58.340" style="s2">that isn&#39;t just about healing but it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.330" end="00:55:00.800" style="s2">about get your together but there</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.340" end="00:55:03.860" style="s2">is resources to do it which is generally</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.800" end="00:55:05.840" style="s2">speaking more likely to come from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.860" end="00:55:07.490" style="s2">left and from progressives who believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.840" end="00:55:10.310" style="s2">in actually investing in public services</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.490" end="00:55:11.750" style="s2">so again it&#39;s how do we marry this</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.310" end="00:55:13.730" style="s2">really important message</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.750" end="00:55:16.070" style="s2">individual responsibility to break</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.730" end="00:55:19.430" style="s2">through these very entrenched cultures</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.070" end="00:55:21.100" style="s2">and how do we actually galvanize broadly</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.430" end="00:55:24.710" style="s2">speaking left-wing and progressive</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.100" end="00:55:26.840" style="s2">sources to actually fund it and to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.710" end="00:55:29.770" style="s2">it happen and that&#39;s for me I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.840" end="00:55:32.090" style="s2">the opening that I see with Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.770" end="00:55:33.710" style="s2">think in this and other conversations</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.090" end="00:55:36.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve had we&#39;ve clearly got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.710" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">different like we we have different</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.200" end="00:55:39.140" style="s2">priorities in terms of kind of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:41.000" style="s2">perspectives like personal</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.140" end="00:55:43.460" style="s2">responsibility or social change but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.000" end="00:55:45.890" style="s2">think we ultimately come from the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.460" end="00:55:48.140" style="s2">place in that we like I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.890" end="00:55:49.490" style="s2">believe in the value of structure I</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.140" end="00:55:51.290" style="s2">believe in the value of government I</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.490" end="00:55:53.630" style="s2">believe that a political project based</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.290" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">around personal growth has a real chance</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.630" end="00:55:57.860" style="s2">of succeeding like I really do think</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:56:00.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s something that&#39;s worth worth</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.860" end="00:56:02.570" style="s2">having and then holding the tension of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.440" end="00:56:04.700" style="s2">but it comes down to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.570" end="00:56:07.160" style="s2">responsibility at the same time and this</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.700" end="00:56:09.350" style="s2">kind of realization of okay we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.160" end="00:56:11.810" style="s2">give people the opportunities but</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.350" end="00:56:13.970" style="s2">ultimately we can&#39;t encourage people to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.810" end="00:56:16.550" style="s2">take them yeah and just an overcoming of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.970" end="00:56:18.980" style="s2">the developmental blindness of policy</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.550" end="00:56:21.290" style="s2">like what a bankrupt idea to think if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.980" end="00:56:22.940" style="s2">just threw more money into the welfare</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.290" end="00:56:24.530" style="s2">state understands that that we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.940" end="00:56:27.010" style="s2">able to tackle a cultural issue like</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.530" end="00:56:29.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a joke it&#39;s more that we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.010" end="00:56:31.430" style="s2">serious psychological support and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.180" end="00:56:33.860" style="s2">psychological intervention to equip</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.430" end="00:56:36.320" style="s2">people to support themselves on their</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.860" end="00:56:38.600" style="s2">own journey of becoming so it is again</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.320" end="00:56:42.170" style="s2">it is is it&#39;s something that is enabled</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.600" end="00:56:44.870" style="s2">by a collective decision to really pool</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.170" end="00:56:47.870" style="s2">resources in a certain area but with an</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.870" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">emphasis on actually where it is likely</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.870" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">to be effective which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:53.360" style="s2">individual psychological and even</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">spiritual level if we can manage to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.360" end="00:56:58.300" style="s2">there right thank you very much thank</p>
