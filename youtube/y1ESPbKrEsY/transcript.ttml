<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">as i was preparing for this podcast i</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">went through ponzi&#39;s books again and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">look for quotes that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">overlapped</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">the political meta-modern perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">and the game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">perspective and i found i think a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">one from</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">i believe it&#39;s the listening society we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">live essentially in a world</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">our value systems do not correspond to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">the society we live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">our ways of seeing sensing feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">acting</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">and understanding do not correspond to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">the very society that we ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">have created this glitch is legal</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">this is the issue of our age to develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">the political psychology of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">unfortunately stimulating such political</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">psychological development</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">is an enormously tricky matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s from hanzi&#39;s book and i would</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">say from the game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">perspective our framing tends to be less</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">literary and less elegant perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">for instance we say that the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">is four parts</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">as humans having gone through our levels</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">of development</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about later we reached</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">a point where</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">our power exceeds our wisdom and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">particular there are four challenges</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">which we can think of as the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">one is that our agreed weapons and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">thirst for power</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">made us capable of destroying ourself by</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">right we could literally probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">kill life on earth probably don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">kill off humans but we can certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">knock down advanced civilization and not</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">only can we do it by intent</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">our technology has also made us capable</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:45.239" style="s2">of destroying ourselves by accident</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">for instance letting loose</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.239" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">nanotechnologies or</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:50.159" style="s2">engineered viruses that produce some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">the effects that we read in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.159" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">dystopian novels</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">and you know one that&#39;s become much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">to the forefront the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">10 years is our pollutants and disregard</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">for the fragility of nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">made us capable of destroying our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">environment which again</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">could lead to the collapse of advanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">and the newest one this one is really</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">because as a person who helped invent</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">the internet some of the communications</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">platforms and such that exist and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">what we intended i can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">but nonetheless i think it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">our irresponsible use of communications</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">have made us capable of destroying our</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">ability to understand and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">about the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">three challenges if our modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">communications platforms and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">evolution of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">have made us incapable of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">and decision</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">making so as to address the first three</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">we&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">to give a little bit of flavor about</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">political metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">again get back on hanzi&#39;s point of view</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">it proposes that there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">dimensions to think about how people</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">need to change</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">society needs to change hunting do a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">much better job on this than i but he</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">asked me to do a very brief</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">introduction and those are hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">complexity which is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">how richly does one think and with</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">what power code which you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">culture or our social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">our state which is what is the typical</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">state of mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">that our citizens are in are we happy</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">are we depressed are we agitated</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">are we in anxiety as our more or less</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">and then depth i think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">interesting one we&#39;ll talk about its</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">touch points to game b</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">maybe you can say a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">about political metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">well yes thank you very much so well</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:55.919" style="s2">starting with the term meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">it has to do with well we live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">a late modern society that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">is still based around all the key</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">insights of the enlightenment really</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">and this includes actually mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">liberal democracy where we cast</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">votes to substantiate truth claims</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">about the political realities and social</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">realities</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">and suggestions that are made really so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">we have this inter-subjectivity at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">heart of what we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">which is fundamentally the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">method applied to different</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">fields of life the same goes really for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">the capitalist market</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">where we of course unevenly have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">access to capital to uh to substantiate</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">products should be created on the market</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">nevertheless you have a broad public of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">people spending money</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">and then companies which evolve and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">produce the products that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.039" style="s2">people want or that people verify with</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.039" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">with their wallets so to speak and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">this central position of science in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">and science being a kind of in a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">even a new religion for us</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">um that we have a sense that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">real reality out there an objective</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">and then this this is modern society and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">today we&#39;re in a late stage of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">modern society</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">and the four uh challenges you you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.599" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">brought up</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">are are similar to the ones that i like</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">to bring up i</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">emphasize the psychological side a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">so saying that well we have um i may</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">have said this on an earlier episode but</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">that we have the the sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">that modern society is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">sustainable in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s visible on so many levels we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">all of these spiraling growth mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">and unlimited growth on a limited planet</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">all of these exponential growths of both</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">output</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">economic and technological output and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">then of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">of the ecological footprint of that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">then we have um excessive inequalities</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">really that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">there are inequalities that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">justified</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">in the world today uh which have to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">with the distribution of resources but</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">also the distribution of symbolic goods</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">health happiness and opportunities in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">life and so on</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">and the third one the most subtle one</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">but perhaps the most pervasive one</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">is alienation or what mark&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">alienation but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">when i use the term i actually have in</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">mind all of the different</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">existential issues and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">the bewilderment that we feel towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">this late modern life that is coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">apart at the seams that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">difficult to find meaning and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">john verveiki for instance uh another</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">i i guess you could say metamodernist</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">thinker i&#39;m not sure he self describes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">as such</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">um he even terms this a meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">and some people go ahead and say there</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">is a meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">of late modernity that all these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">are interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">and then people are looking uh for this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">golden thread for this pathway away from</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">this crisis or through this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">into a new more stable equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">something you can believe in something</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">uh that would be utopian or protopian by</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">today&#39;s standards</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">uh protopian meaning that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">can believe in the progress narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">that you can actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">in that hey i can see that this society</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">is going to get better not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">going to grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">and then grow and then the cracks are</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">going to grow and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">things are going to fall apart at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">seams</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">so if you ask me what the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">really really is at the deepest level</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">and or the most basic level i believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">we have actually a sense-making crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">i believe that what&#39;s broken in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">is our shared um</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">reality checking our shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">um meaning making communication</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">and verification of claims and realities</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">so we end up at a terrible distance from</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">and this is of course visible in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">political polarization</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">it&#39;s also uh visible in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">post-truth society of all in all its</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">forms and guises</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">and also just the fact that we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">not be able</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">to even get down to the basics of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">real and uh i&#39;ll i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.279" style="s2">deepen this topic a little bit more but</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.279" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">particularly what i see</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">is that we have collectively started and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not the first to claim this</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">there were similar terms used by de las</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">the the french post-modern theorist</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">or late post-modern theorist that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">resembling a schizophrenic collectively</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to resemble a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">schizophrenic mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">we&#39;re losing grip of reality and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">really in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">atlas shrugged um position but not</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">in a heroic way but in a very ah</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">well in a clearly anti-heroic or</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">misadventure kind of way so</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">uh i yeah i think if we&#39;re we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">the deepest solutions we should go back</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">issues of knowledge issues of</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">etc we don&#39;t know how to change the oil</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">most likely in a real sense to not feel</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">from from reality um in in its</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">more visceral form and there are many</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">reintegrate this of course there you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">have prepper movements you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">all kinds of new survivalism that shows</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">you have all sorts of workshops where</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">what i feel is being</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">overall big goal</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">to recreate governance in a way</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">of course social media is a very big</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">part of it and this disconnect from</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">from everyday reality and here i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">actually zoom in on what i meant a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">little bit with the schizophrenia part</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">so uh unfortunately my own family</p>

<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">would write these letters</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">i&#39;m a strong believer that the engine of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">science is robust and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">but the sociology of science has serious</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">that need to be addressed is the funding</p>

<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">when you read a paper</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">uh scientific paper even go read the</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">and so our core code our operating</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">it seems to me that the attack on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">problem of sense making is unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">you know a pretty hard one there is no</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">daniel schmuckenberger lays out some</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s not easy and i would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">that the hierarchical</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:22.799" style="s2">at least a hint of the direction we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">go which is you know even fairly smart</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.799" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">guys like ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">have a hard time keeping up and parsing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">what&#39;s going on i know i do i don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">it&#39;s really really hard to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">the world by myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">so a game b concept is collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">is absolutely indispensable and our own</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">view is it should be bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">it should not be top down you should</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">find other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">who think sort of like we do though with</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">are making way greater sense of the</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">by ourselves i&#39;m already seeing us all</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">change our point of views from this</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">sense making opportunity and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">less powerfully but still relatively</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">powerfully our</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">online forums dedicated to sense making</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">like rally point alpha and plenty of</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s at least a short riff on this</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">phenomenon that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">you know fundamentally hard because our</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">world is more complex than our brains</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">and that the the code or the deep code</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">of our social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">provides gigantic incentives for bad</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">not even if it&#39;s knowingly bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">discourse but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">all steered by the money on money return</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">so so there there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">threads there that are interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">pick up</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">um let&#39;s start with the money on money</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">um well so we do have the open markets</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">as a way of voting with our money what</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">makes sense to create</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">right but as critics of</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">bigger than ourselves to create our</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">reality because it was just up to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">and i was just walking around by myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">in my garden</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">and had to figure stuff out i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">get far at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">just like you said so it&#39;s not just of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">course a group of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">of my friends it&#39;s the wider community</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">science media and all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">so what used to be in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">modernity&#39;s earlier phases a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:25.840" style="s2">coherent</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">uh such bond between individual people</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.840" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">and the sense making community</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">and reality verification mechanism it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">has been severed</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">by the internet because we now can</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">find these bubbles and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">verify claims</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">and intuitions and conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">they pop up with increasing rapidity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">uh the same thing with of course flat</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">earth that people</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">have this intuition and then they they</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">can verify</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">one another and say let&#39;s be critical</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">and they might have difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">verifying the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">that uh the claims of actual science</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">and uh actual education within the flat</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">earth community they will say again</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">please think for yourself and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">often is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">not to think for yourself the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">to have a reliable enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">community to think for you because</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.840" style="s2">hey we won&#39;t get very far if we try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">think for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.840" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">even on this topic and this actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">collects</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">it connects beautifully to the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">democracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.600" style="s2">so political metamodernism is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">opposite pull</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">of populism so populism is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">lowest common denominator that well in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">european countries a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">irritated by the presence of arabs who</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">integrate poorly into</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">their communities and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">can feel this relatively viscerally in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">lives and they can see it out on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">street and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">well they have events and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">and stories about this so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">easy topic for populism whereas climate</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">you have to think abstractly you have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">think long term</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">you&#39;re not noticing anything particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">here and now</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">and you have to trust complicated</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">predictions which</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">are admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">tentative and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">relate that to your own life and to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">politics of your country</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">and to the market mechanisms and to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">technology and the use thereof</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">so that&#39;s a much much more complex issue</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">and it requires co-development and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">requires good</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">knowledge processes good sense making</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">and good translation of those sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">making processes</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">into everyday lives and communities</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">as society today</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">so political metamodernism will never be</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">popular it&#39;s not going to be like</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">socialism like a mass</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">movement and there won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">meta-modernist</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">countries or societies which are</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">nominally meta-modernist</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">it&#39;s rather this funnel towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">higher complexity where we build upon</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:29.119" style="s2">each other like the scientific community</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">rather and this goes of course also for</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">our existential development for our</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">religious beliefs and so on rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">falling back</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">on the lowest common denominators which</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">our intuitions often lead us towards but</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">our intuitions fail us</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">because the world isn&#39;t intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">humans weren&#39;t invented for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">complex world and this complex world</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">just came into being or just happens to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">be there and hey</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">we humans are like heidegger said cast</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">so the main challenge i think is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">somehow lift</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">this improvement of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">quality of knowledge making</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">in to make it into one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">political issues of our societies</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">that governments around the world should</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">ally and think</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">okay how can we make our politics much</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">much more empirical how can we make our</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">publics our populations</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:34.680" style="s2">much more critically minded how can we</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.680" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">communications how can we arm</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">or or equip people with</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">the tools to evaluate truth claims to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">reference systems out there in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">i&#39;d like to say more about reference</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">systems but i&#39;ll let you in jim</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">yeah that was certainly good and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">certainly that would be one</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">path forward and i would say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">path that we all need to be working on</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">and certainly people in the game b space</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">are working on encouraging these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s not clear to me that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">faced with the fundamental dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">we have that this can be accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">top down i mean look at the current</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:19.800" style="s2">american political mess</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">we have we have essentially</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.800" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">anti-liberalism of the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">and then we have an ever-shrinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">number of sensible people in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">and you then add to that the current</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">state of our communications</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">and we have insanity propagating itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">day by day where</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">we now have a shooting on the left and a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">shooting on the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">and god knows where that will escalate</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">to so</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not putting all of our eggs in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">that one basket of top down political</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">change we do think</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">eventually that has to happen but game b</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">is more and more</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">being focused on a day-to-day basis on</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">localism on building communities</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">can bootstrap and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">essentially demonstrate that there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">the problem with political metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">is that it is more tell than show</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">and so we believe that we have to put</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">is that it should start from the bottom</p>

<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">and we can rethink things a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">so that we can grasp more abstract</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:19.040" style="s2">so i really see it as a both and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">i&#39;d like to stop there i still have uh</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:33.359" style="s2">tends to break down and i&#39;d like to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.359" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">a goal of both political metamodernism</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">game b and i do think we should be</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:44.839" style="s2">pressure points in the world system</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">where these things are</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">actualizable yeah let&#39;s get back to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">but let me react a little bit to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">idea of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">a meta modern berlin that would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">if it could actually be pulled off but</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">you know our modern social operating</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">systems have a zillion</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">veto points you know berlin is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">sovereign berlin</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">lives within one of the german states</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">brandenburg i believe it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">and brandenburg has its own authority</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">and then brandenburg lives in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">the german federation lives in the eu</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">and so the constraints on what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">meta-modern mayor of berlin could</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">actually do strike me as perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">disappointing</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">our game b approach at this point though</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">there are certainly people working on</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">political ideas at a higher level from</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">fred weinstein&#39;s unity 2020 idea of</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">running an independent candidate for</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">president of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">is at least nominally a game b idea i</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">think many of us are now focused on a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">scale to prove the principle which the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">label we use for that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">proto-b and literally a proto-b</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">probably starts out with a cluster of 15</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">or 20 people</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">maybe 30 and then aggregates into three</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">or four such clusters</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">either on a piece of land or as a series</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">of co-housing projects</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">in a city which we call a dunbar which</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">can actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">operate as a whole game b community with</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">kb values</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">in various places using the same social</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:26.359" style="s2">and again that&#39;s another key point of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">our theory is high empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.359" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">anti-utopianism we don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">you can take</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">a prescription from a book and say go do</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:36.079" style="s2">this and build a new world</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">so not only do we have a proto-b which</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">replicates via having new dunbars</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:42.880" style="s2">a little communities of 150 people but</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">there&#39;ll be multiple proto bees with</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.880" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">different constitutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">some of them could be radically</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">egalitarian i&#39;ve recently done a fair</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:51.920" style="s2">amount of research</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">on kibbutz&#39;s in fact we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.920" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">scholar on kibbutz&#39;s will appear right</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">before you</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">on my podcast and kabutz has started out</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">as radically egalitarian and over time</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">many though not all of them have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">to kind of a mixed</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">capitalist egalitarian system i expect</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">proto-b&#39;s to do the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">and they may vary with respect to social</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">class some of them may focus principally</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">on college educated people</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping others if i can have my way</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">one of the early proto-b&#39;s will focus</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">on working-class people and the problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">that they confront in our society</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">and so again we&#39;re really focused on</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">proving our ideas at a small scale</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">but with theory that can replicate</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">gradually and eventually take over</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">no world in fact i wrote a paper called</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">a journey to game b</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">which is on medium and it lays out the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">long road to game b which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">more or less as i described could take</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">100 years 80 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">and of course the other issue is if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">build enough of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s a crisis which we think is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">fairly likely there could be a short</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">road to game b</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">where let&#39;s say there&#39;s a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">thousand game b people out there</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">and maybe twenty thousand of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">actually living the game b life and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">when the crisis comes this might be the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">most well-prepared cadre to step forward</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">to the world and say people look what</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing here&#39;s our evidence</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not just and talk this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">how to organize society and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">at that point of crisis there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">opportunity for a short road to game b</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s kind of the center of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:22.880" style="s2">the game b energy at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">though because nobody owns game b and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">is radically self-organizing there are</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">i&#39;m a great believer in institutions</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">talk by me on a better monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">and another area that i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">interested in is liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">because that&#39;s you point out in your</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">book hierarchical complexity varies by</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">person considerably</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">right and really not much you can do</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">about it maybe you can raise people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">complexity a bit but not a lot under</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">liquid democracy the idea is people</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">proxy their votes</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">right i had 30 proxies on issues from</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">there are lots of people who know more</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">about it than i do</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">and i would proxy my votes to somebody</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">alignment with and i perceived to be</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">knowledgeable than i that could include</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">for instance i might proxy my</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:45.280" style="s2">can have democracy</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">and yet not be so constrained by the</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">maybe we can talk about verification</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">mechanisms a little bit or you can</p>

<p begin="00:52:30.559" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">often have a gut reaction say that in</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">you kind of institute it</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:52.559" style="s2">that&#39;s probably not the the way things</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">are going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.559" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">and it would be high too high risk</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">and too high investment strategy</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">rather there should be a plethora of</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">many experiments</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">powered for instance by game b groups</p>

<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">to experiment with different forms of</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">um and gathering up data really what</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.079" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">works where under which contexts</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">the same would go for uh commoning and</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">and to a certain extent i suppose to</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">to stay as close to reality as possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">meaning check the facts check the best</p>

<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">check the best research and all the</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">and today we don&#39;t have very advanced</p>

<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">so empirical politics on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">in perpetually increasing our</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.839" end="00:54:17.440" style="s2">scientific capability to together grasp</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">the world and be collectively</p>

<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:25.480" style="s2">then on the other hand using that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">increased empiricism that</p>

<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">to deepening democracy maybe i make this</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">sound uh much more status than i</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">intend i don&#39;t imagine this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">the this is necessarily top-down</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:59.760" style="s2">state solution rather i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:02.079" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t ignore the political realm</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">it has a role to play</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.079" end="00:55:05.359" style="s2">but that role is likely to be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">smaller</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.359" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">in fact once once you set up all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:13.200" style="s2">the actual solutions because the private</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">part the private public partnerships are</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.200" end="00:55:17.359" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">local communities are engaged civil</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.359" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">society is engaged in many different</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">the transnational community is engaged</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">and um looking then at</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">how do you spread these ideas you</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">mentioned before well</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">so berlin is in brandenburg brandenburg</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">is in germany</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">is actually the european commission</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">it is considerably more inventive and</p>

<p begin="00:55:58.640" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">and they examine issues such as</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">very seriously they also look at things</p>

<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">they also look at things like climate</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">so what we want is a network or a spider</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">that you see the institutions of</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">is going to go off a cliff and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">and we have to then try to get off this</p>

<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">and towards another one so we want to</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t have to be antithetical</p>

<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">reality works you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve been spending the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">doing is learning about complexity</p>

<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">and the biggest takeaways from</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">as epistemic modesty how little we can</p>

<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">what will happen when we make</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:40.319" style="s2">so anyone who thinks they have the</p>

<p begin="01:00:40.319" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">or propertarianism one thing you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.880" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">count on is that they&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">rather we can take some principles as</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">you suggest you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">more democracy and you know preserving</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">localism and experiment try things and</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">if they don&#39;t work beyond intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">honest and say this didn&#39;t work let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">try something else you know my writing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">on liquid democracy for instance</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">i warn every in every essay this is an</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">interesting idea but it has not been</p>

<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">so let&#39;s try it at the municipal level</p>

<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">city 25 000 people it turns out to be a</p>

<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:24.160" style="s2">something else i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">tremendously important</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.160" end="01:01:28.079" style="s2">as you mentioned these different levels</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:29.839" style="s2">brings up another bit of language we</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.079" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">we sometimes use in the game b world</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.839" end="01:01:33.680" style="s2">which is that these levels of governance</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">essentially should be fractal that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.680" end="01:01:37.359" style="s2">should be self-similar that they have</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:39.280" style="s2">similar values and similar</p>

<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">one of the things that strikes me that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.319" end="01:02:47.760" style="s2">would be useful to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.160" end="01:02:49.599" style="s2">is to acknowledge that there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">numerous ways to</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.599" end="01:02:53.760" style="s2">head towards what comes next and to find</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">some way for us to more</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">formally interact with each other and</p>

<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:03.200" style="s2">and maintain our own points of view but</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:05.440" style="s2">agree upon what we agree upon</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.200" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">in fact i&#39;ve labeled this opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.440" end="01:03:10.240" style="s2">the big change coalition</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">strikes me that that might be a move</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.240" end="01:03:12.640" style="s2">that could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:14.160" style="s2">quite powerful that could be done right</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.160" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">yes so maybe some kind of world</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">conference for this</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">might uh might be a a good step</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">um where um</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">people become acquainted uh across these</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">networks and across</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">these different ideas and basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">one one of the key tenets of</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">metamodernism is perspective taking</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:44.480" style="s2">and the ability to coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">many perspectives in a creative manner</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.480" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:50.240" style="s2">critiquing and deconstructing but also</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">reconstructing</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.240" end="01:03:58.799" style="s2">and i think this is a general um</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">sentiment and impetus that a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.799" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">like-minded people share so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">doing with a podcast is important of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">but we could bring people closer</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">together i guess</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:15.680" style="s2">there are already many network meetings</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:16.559" style="s2">so one of the most important challenges</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.680" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">to those though</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.559" end="01:04:21.119" style="s2">are are is this bottleneck challenge</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:24.559" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">we don&#39;t seem to successfully imbue</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.559" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">each other&#39;s perspectives because</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">they&#39;re too complex and basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">and each of us is only in the individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:36.240" style="s2">person we have a few</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">key insights each a smart person</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.240" end="01:04:41.359" style="s2">is lucky in their life if they have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">few strokes of genius and a few</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.359" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">theories and perspectives of their own</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.799" end="01:04:51.760" style="s2">and we need a lot of those things to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">coordinated so somehow we should get</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.760" end="01:04:55.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">conversation going and not just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.119" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">conversation but we should get</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2">constructive projects going around these</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.760" end="01:05:05.760" style="s2">but to do that i think again</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">we need to rethink the sense making</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:12.960" style="s2">through which this is organized so just</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">just bringing all of these smart and</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.960" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">big-hearted people</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">to the to the same place might actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:20.799" style="s2">not work we</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:21.760" style="s2">we would then we would first have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.799" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">invent</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.760" end="01:05:28.000" style="s2">the best possible way of creating</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:30.640" style="s2">resonance and shared understanding and</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.000" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">shared emergence</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.640" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">and emerge is of course a common thread</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">a lot of people want to see what emerges</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:41.599" style="s2">want to kick back and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">listen in and stimulate these meetings</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">and imagine something</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">fantastic will emerge and it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">that it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">just around the corner something awesome</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">is going to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:54.559" style="s2">uh something great that will affect and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">change the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.559" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">i&#39;m a little bit less optimistic i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:05.440" style="s2">more creative in terms of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">guide this emergence what is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.440" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">right process of knowledge sharing</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">of communication of shared understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:16.839" style="s2">of decision making</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:18.240" style="s2">in these varied projects and across them</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.839" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.240" end="01:06:25.920" style="s2">yeah i sense we lack a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">a social institutional invention</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.920" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">for gathering all of these diverse</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:36.319" style="s2">but aligned forces and somehow</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">coordinating all of these efforts i</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.319" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">would still argue towards</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:42.319" style="s2">key points in the world pressure points</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.319" end="01:06:46.480" style="s2">i i imagine something like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">that the world right now is having a bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.480" end="01:06:49.039" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:51.520" style="s2">switching metaphors it&#39;s not having</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">schizophrenia we&#39;re having a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.520" end="01:06:55.520" style="s2">epileptic seizure and the world map is</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">blinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.520" end="01:06:59.359" style="s2">with all sorts of dramatic events and</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.359" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">and we chase after each one of them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">comment upon them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">and try to understand them and then the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:09.920" style="s2">next thing happens it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">covet crisis it&#39;s the black lives matter</p>

<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">it&#39;s the u.s election all of these</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.200" end="01:07:18.319" style="s2">different things right</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:20.160" style="s2">somehow uh we should be not be</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.319" end="01:07:23.119" style="s2">caught up in the epileptic seizure</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.160" end="01:07:26.880" style="s2">ourselves we should somehow</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.119" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">see this blinking for what it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.880" end="01:07:32.559" style="s2">and uh that there are going to be a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">of dramatic events and there are going</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.559" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">to be a lot of strategic opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">for really affecting the trajectory of</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">and we should be able to coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">deeply and strategically around them now</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">how do we get there</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">just gathering everyone under the same</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:50.240" style="s2">roof uh for</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:53.119" style="s2">uh for shaking hands and uh and giving</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.240" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">half hour presentations would probably</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.119" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">not cut</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:59.200" style="s2">it we would need some kind of profound</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">sense making process that is more akin</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.200" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">to the group</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:04.319" style="s2">of five and the group of 15 that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">were speaking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.319" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">interesting i would 100 agree i like the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:09.359" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:10.720" style="s2">and in fact you know just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.359" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">serendipitously</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.720" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">my early thinking about this big change</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:16.400" style="s2">coalition</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">has been along those lines interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve drafted one other person who</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.960" end="01:08:24.159" style="s2">resonated with the idea and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">to attempt to build a draft core</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.159" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">because one of the ideas i think is very</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:30.640" style="s2">important is coherent pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">the two words are somewhat contradictory</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:33.839" style="s2">but i think hold them both in your head</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">simultaneously it&#39;s hugely important to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.839" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">make this work</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">is that we must be truly honoring the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:41.920" style="s2">idea of pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">that you know these different points of</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.920" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">view are</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">perhaps all right or at least are worth</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:49.120" style="s2">pursuing in their own rights even where</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:51.120" style="s2">they contradict each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.120" end="01:08:52.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay on the other hand for</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.120" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">this thing to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">there has to be some coherence and one</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">of the ones</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">me and this other person just plopped</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:02.480" style="s2">down and in a couple of emails exchanges</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">is you know no first degree racists for</p>

<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:06.319" style="s2">right or no nazis if you want to put it</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">in a more</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.319" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">common terminal we think we&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">come up with a couple of dozen</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">things that are at least candidates for</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:16.239" style="s2">this potential group to form around</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:18.400" style="s2">and i think it&#39;d be a great idea to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.239" end="01:09:19.199" style="s2">a formal sense-making process that</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.400" end="01:09:21.040" style="s2">brings</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">potential candidates to the big change</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.040" end="01:09:25.120" style="s2">coalition into a way to interoperate</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:26.960" style="s2">with each other to discuss what should</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">be the coherent court</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.960" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">by some consensus process and if</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:31.839" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">voting process but consensus would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.839" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">better to</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:36.799" style="s2">you know take some of these candidates</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:37.440" style="s2">throw them out modify them add some new</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.440" end="01:09:41.600" style="s2">and before we have this world conference</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:42.719" style="s2">unfortunately probably has to be virtual</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.600" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">in the current world</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:47.120" style="s2">that there is some hands being held</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">across a group of entities that says yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">this is our coherence</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:51.920" style="s2">it&#39;s relatively small it leaves a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:54.320" style="s2">room for</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.920" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">our pluralistic ways of addressing what</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.320" end="01:09:59.199" style="s2">we see that needs to be done</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:10:00.960" style="s2">but we all at least agree on a small</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.199" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">common core</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.960" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">and so i think that fits in nicely with</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">the before</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">part the part that i think needs some</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">work i think it&#39;s very good for you to</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:11.840" style="s2">point this out is that we also have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">have an after meeting</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.840" end="01:10:17.040" style="s2">process to actually turn this into</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">action how can there be ongoing sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:20.159" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:20.880" style="s2">across these groups and horizontal</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.159" end="01:10:24.080" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.880" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">sharing in the game b world we call it x</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.080" end="01:10:27.440" style="s2">in a box so</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:29.760" style="s2">kind of an awkward term but the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.440" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">if someone finds something that works</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.760" end="01:10:33.920" style="s2">they have a duty to document it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:35.920" style="s2">share it horizontally and give it to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.920" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">world for other people to use</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.920" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">and if all these different groups that</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:41.520" style="s2">are on their pluralistic missions though</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:44.080" style="s2">driven by a coherent core</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:44.640" style="s2">individually discover things that work</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.080" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.640" end="01:10:49.920" style="s2">a high fidelity communications platform</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:51.280" style="s2">so that people could look to it to see</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.920" end="01:10:53.120" style="s2">what does work</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.280" end="01:10:55.440" style="s2">then indeed those x in the boxes could</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.120" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">evolve people take them and modify them</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.440" end="01:10:58.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">a liquid democracy 1.0 ah it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.960" end="01:11:02.719" style="s2">found to work in a proto-v</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">in virginia but it had these little</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.719" end="01:11:05.920" style="s2">issues right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.920" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">tweaking it somebody else tries a</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.920" end="01:11:09.679" style="s2">variant on it changes a couple things</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">and said this works better right</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.679" end="01:11:13.760" style="s2">and this form of horizontal transmission</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.159" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">of capability could be</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.760" end="01:11:17.120" style="s2">really important in kind of the after</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">meetings</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.120" end="01:11:21.040" style="s2">an ongoing kind of mechanism the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:22.960" style="s2">idea which i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.040" end="01:11:25.199" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to put forth is some of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.960" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">glue around this and again it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.199" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">bit contradictory but that&#39;s all right</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">hold all these in our head is that this</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.440" end="01:11:31.760" style="s2">coherence is going to be relatively</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.280" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.760" end="01:11:35.520" style="s2">it has to be to get a large number of</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">people to buy into it</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:40.640" style="s2">and so we all have to be willing to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">the cultural meta value of alignment</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.640" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">beyond agreement</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.400" end="01:11:46.800" style="s2">meaning that we all acknowledge we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:48.080" style="s2">the same side even if we fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.800" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.080" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">about some tactic or technique that one</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.679" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">takes and that in human history has</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">shown themselves to be very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">the religious wars are quite informative</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">of that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:02.080" style="s2">people slaughter each other by the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">millions over the most</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.080" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">what seemingly trivial religious issues</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:09.520" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s some reaction to your</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:11.199" style="s2">thought that since making</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.520" end="01:12:12.960" style="s2">some process to bring these groups</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.199" end="01:12:14.159" style="s2">together it&#39;s got to be wrapped in sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.960" end="01:12:17.679" style="s2">making both before</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.159" end="01:12:20.560" style="s2">and after yeah i i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.679" end="01:12:23.920" style="s2">actually um i i&#39;d like to propose</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.560" end="01:12:27.520" style="s2">something a little bit bolder actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.920" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">that the coherence should be based</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.520" end="01:12:32.000" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">goal formulations and</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.000" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">we should have some kind of membership</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">and constitution</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">in which the key goals are written down</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">and then whatever is argued</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:49.440" style="s2">whatever is proposed to the group as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:52.800" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.440" end="01:12:56.000" style="s2">as a perspective as an alliance</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.800" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">should be coherent with</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.000" end="01:13:03.440" style="s2">those goals so</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:06.719" style="s2">i i would argue that a goal</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.440" end="01:13:10.320" style="s2">that is of utmost importance is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.719" end="01:13:14.560" style="s2">we have to put sense making processes</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.320" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">and higher truthfulness</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.560" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">of the political processes of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">communication processes</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:23.360" style="s2">making society more scientific in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:26.320" style="s2">profound sense but also more</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.360" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">existentially mature</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.320" end="01:13:30.480" style="s2">should be our core goals then we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.600" style="s2">argue about</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.480" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">what that means in practice</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.600" end="01:13:37.120" style="s2">but some kind of directionality some</p>

<p begin="01:13:59.040" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">we should also ritualize</p>

<p begin="01:15:30.480" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">we need somehow to be able to house</p>

<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:41.760" style="s2">where people still feel the coherence</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.159" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">where when we feel it</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.760" end="01:15:47.840" style="s2">strongly so we feel drawn to it</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:50.000" style="s2">and this i would like to say also</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.840" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">as a word of warning is what our friends</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.000" end="01:15:56.000" style="s2">the fascists are looking for</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:58.640" style="s2">the the meta right but they imagine this</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.000" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">structure or this transcendence to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.640" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">taken</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:04.560" style="s2">from uh from the traditional religions</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.320" end="01:16:06.000" style="s2">or some kind of cathedral building or</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.560" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">some kind of totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.000" end="01:16:10.480" style="s2">or some kind of one will that asserts</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:12.480" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.480" end="01:16:13.920" style="s2">and some kind of profound unity and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.480" end="01:16:15.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not looking for unity we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.920" end="01:16:19.360" style="s2">looking for as you say</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.280" end="01:16:22.640" style="s2">a pluriverse uh a coherent pluriverse</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.360" end="01:16:25.760" style="s2">or a complex ontological object is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.640" end="01:16:28.080" style="s2">term i like it or yeah you said it</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.760" end="01:16:30.560" style="s2">better you said</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.080" end="01:16:31.520" style="s2">what was the term you used jim coherent</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.560" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.520" end="01:16:34.960" style="s2">coherent pluralism yes so we should</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.960" end="01:16:39.440" style="s2">as it were a digital temple of coherent</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.159" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.440" end="01:16:43.679" style="s2">uh where these i mean on a very visceral</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:46.880" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.679" end="01:16:49.360" style="s2">these energies are directed</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.880" end="01:16:51.199" style="s2">and i think that is something that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.360" end="01:16:54.640" style="s2">really need to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.199" end="01:16:56.320" style="s2">now i see all of these geniuses</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.640" end="01:16:58.400" style="s2">out there and i see all of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.320" end="01:17:00.880" style="s2">fantastic ideas on projects</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.400" end="01:17:01.679" style="s2">but i see that the coherence is too</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.880" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.679" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">i also see that a lot of people go crazy</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:09.040" style="s2">along the way</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.280" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">because because there is no container or</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.040" end="01:17:15.920" style="s2">structure which corresponds to</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">a temple to contain it and what we get</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.920" end="01:17:20.080" style="s2">instead then</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:22.400" style="s2">is that people run off on these on these</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.080" end="01:17:24.400" style="s2">fascist experiments because they long so</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:27.600" style="s2">much for this transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.400" end="01:17:29.920" style="s2">for this oneness and unity ah</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.600" end="01:17:31.520" style="s2">yeah very a lot of very good points</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.920" end="01:17:34.159" style="s2">there which i&#39;m 100</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.520" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">in agreement with i believe let me first</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.159" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">react to rituals</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">i think that is really important because</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:42.560" style="s2">again our world is so</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">complex relative to our own hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.560" end="01:17:46.480" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:47.280" style="s2">that simplification and repetition</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.480" end="01:17:49.120" style="s2">actually help us</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.280" end="01:17:50.400" style="s2">deal with the complexity of the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.120" end="01:17:52.560" style="s2">right not having to</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.400" end="01:17:54.080" style="s2">figure out de novo how to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.560" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">every situation</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.080" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">and it reminds me that in the original</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:18:00.640" style="s2">game b the 2013</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">version we actually had a few little</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.640" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">rituals</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:05.440" style="s2">one was we referred to each other as</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:07.840" style="s2">peers</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.440" end="01:18:09.440" style="s2">you know kind of analogous to the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:10.800" style="s2">soviets and their comrades</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.440" end="01:18:13.000" style="s2">thing right and we thought that was</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:15.679" style="s2">really important because we were</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.000" end="01:18:17.120" style="s2">anti-hierarchy radically decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.679" end="01:18:18.800" style="s2">we are all peers let&#39;s just call</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.120" end="01:18:19.600" style="s2">ourselves fears we should go back to</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.800" end="01:18:21.120" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.600" end="01:18:22.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why we did the other one</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.120" end="01:18:24.840" style="s2">that we had i don&#39;t think we ever</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.800" end="01:18:28.560" style="s2">actually codified it but i would call it</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:31.520" style="s2">explicit and excessive politeness right</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.560" end="01:18:32.960" style="s2">we never ever until they started to fail</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.520" end="01:18:34.960" style="s2">then the group fell apart</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.960" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">were we anything other than with very</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.960" end="01:18:39.440" style="s2">polite with each other</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:40.880" style="s2">right and excessively so almost like a</p>

<p begin="01:18:40.880" end="01:18:45.520" style="s2">in louis the 14th day or something right</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.679" end="01:18:46.080" style="s2">we would very much defer to the other</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.520" end="01:18:48.719" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.080" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">we would apologize very easily and</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.719" end="01:18:51.760" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:54.880" style="s2">should we give offense etc kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.760" end="01:18:57.199" style="s2">stylized explicit politics</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.880" end="01:18:58.159" style="s2">might be an interesting ritual as an</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.199" end="01:19:00.400" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.159" end="01:19:01.199" style="s2">that could help push away the known</p>

<p begin="01:19:01.199" end="01:19:04.640" style="s2">of dealing with people particularly in a</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.640" end="01:19:08.159" style="s2">fashion but anyways certainly it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.040" end="01:19:10.400" style="s2">some serious</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.159" end="01:19:12.239" style="s2">thoughts and what those rituals would be</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.400" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">right that could be a process to think</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.239" end="01:19:15.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:18.640" style="s2">propose and either adopt by consensus or</p>

<p begin="01:19:58.560" end="01:20:02.719" style="s2">can find a goal formulation</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.120" end="01:20:05.920" style="s2">that a fair number of people would agree</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:07.440" style="s2">to so i think that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:09.199" style="s2">and of course people are going to have</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:12.480" style="s2">different ideas about what</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.199" end="01:20:13.520" style="s2">truthfulness means but as you said with</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.480" end="01:20:16.400" style="s2">the politeness</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.520" end="01:20:17.600" style="s2">part that if if we can show it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.400" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">tell it</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.600" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">if we can create a culture around it</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.360" style="s2">then perhaps we can contain more of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:27.280" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.360" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">um and i mean the energy is tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.280" end="01:20:32.159" style="s2">really and and it&#39;s part of why the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:34.480" style="s2">world is flipping out so much</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.159" end="01:20:37.040" style="s2">people are having all of these profound</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.480" end="01:20:40.080" style="s2">spiritual experiences people are having</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.040" end="01:20:42.159" style="s2">all of these intellectual awakenings</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.080" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">people are waking up to</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.159" end="01:20:48.639" style="s2">systems perspectives cross-disciplinary</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:49.679" style="s2">perspectives pop people are trashing</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:51.760" style="s2">their old</p>

<p begin="01:20:54.480" end="01:20:59.920" style="s2">um and at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.840" end="01:21:01.520" style="s2">you see a lot of these people not</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.920" end="01:21:03.199" style="s2">knowing what to do with</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.520" end="01:21:05.920" style="s2">with all of these things that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.199" end="01:21:09.040" style="s2">access often through through the web</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.920" end="01:21:10.639" style="s2">and being unable to to</p>

<p begin="01:21:10.639" end="01:21:14.159" style="s2">around it and to be able to create</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.800" end="01:21:17.280" style="s2">something in our own life</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.159" end="01:21:20.400" style="s2">uh we often need companionship then</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.280" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">so if we can increase uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.400" end="01:21:25.120" style="s2">the amount of friendship between</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.520" end="01:21:26.880" style="s2">what i would loosely term all the</p>

<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:43.440" style="s2">now with a very strong caveat</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.080" end="01:21:45.679" style="s2">not the integral traditionalists or the</p>

<p begin="01:21:53.520" end="01:21:57.600" style="s2">but rather a conspiracy against the</p>

<p begin="01:22:08.000" end="01:22:13.600" style="s2">being in that transcendental space being</p>

<p begin="01:22:15.920" end="01:22:20.719" style="s2">we are going to invent rituals with</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.639" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">which we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.719" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">with which we can convene as not just</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:27.199" style="s2">intellects not just dry intellects but</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:29.520" style="s2">as whole human beings</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.199" end="01:22:30.400" style="s2">and there are there are four different</p>

<p begin="01:22:30.400" end="01:22:37.199" style="s2">uh um creative class which i feel is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.639" end="01:22:38.719" style="s2">is a very instrumental to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.199" end="01:22:41.120" style="s2">metamodernist movement and</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.719" end="01:22:43.520" style="s2">this class has yet to wake up to its own</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.120" end="01:22:44.719" style="s2">uh to its own coherence because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:47.520" style="s2">diverse but there are</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.719" end="01:22:48.159" style="s2">deep uh there are deep structural issues</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.520" end="01:22:50.719" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.159" end="01:22:52.800" style="s2">connect its members and i&#39;ve said this</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.719" end="01:22:53.280" style="s2">before it&#39;s a triple h population it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:23:03.600" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">there are the hackers who the silicon</p>

<p begin="01:23:30.159" end="01:23:34.400" style="s2">can be created to to run</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.000" end="01:23:35.120" style="s2">our culture and then there are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.400" end="01:23:37.920" style="s2">the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.120" end="01:23:39.120" style="s2">age which wasn&#39;t in the listening</p>

<p begin="01:23:39.120" end="01:23:42.880" style="s2">added later the hermetics the people who</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.239" end="01:23:46.080" style="s2">are more</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.880" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">towards the occult side arguably perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.080" end="01:23:49.440" style="s2">the most dangerous group</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.360" end="01:23:50.560" style="s2">because they love all of these symbols</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.440" end="01:23:52.800" style="s2">and they love all</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.560" end="01:23:54.960" style="s2">of these rituals so much and they look</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.800" end="01:23:57.040" style="s2">so so deeply for the meaning in these</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.960" end="01:24:00.159" style="s2">that they can sometimes fall into</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.040" end="01:24:00.639" style="s2">traps of uh well unhealthy occultism or</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.159" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.639" end="01:24:06.880" style="s2">even far-right stuff but the</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:07.520" style="s2">hermetics are the experts on creating</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:10.800" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.520" end="01:24:12.080" style="s2">new games on these new rituals so we</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.800" end="01:24:15.679" style="s2">somehow need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.080" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">draw on all of these four competencies</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.679" end="01:24:19.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">which really they can&#39;t be situated</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.520" end="01:24:22.239" style="s2">within one person because each of them</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:24.960" style="s2">takes so much</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.239" end="01:24:26.239" style="s2">talent and so much personality and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.960" end="01:24:29.520" style="s2">much of your</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.239" end="01:24:32.000" style="s2">uh core being to develop that people</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.520" end="01:24:35.120" style="s2">have these different specialties and yet</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.000" end="01:24:37.679" style="s2">together they are all part of</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.120" end="01:24:39.679" style="s2">well not they don&#39;t fit in in modern</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.679" end="01:24:42.960" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.679" end="01:24:46.320" style="s2">they have a specific class interest</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.960" end="01:24:47.760" style="s2">which is transnational and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.320" end="01:24:49.679" style="s2">like the top-down</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.760" end="01:24:51.679" style="s2">governance structures they don&#39;t fit in</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.679" end="01:24:54.639" style="s2">the labor markets they all</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.679" end="01:24:56.639" style="s2">often fall down and precarious positions</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.639" end="01:24:58.960" style="s2">uh flip out for reasons</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.639" end="01:24:59.840" style="s2">that have they they often have adhd and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.960" end="01:25:04.320" style="s2">add</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.840" end="01:25:08.000" style="s2">sometimes uh high functioning autism</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.320" end="01:25:11.360" style="s2">so somehow uh the temple i</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.000" end="01:25:13.520" style="s2">imagine uh for for game b</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.360" end="01:25:15.040" style="s2">uh the virtual temple which has this</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.520" end="01:25:18.400" style="s2">transcendent goal</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.040" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">has to draw all of these four groups</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.400" end="01:25:22.239" style="s2">and let these energies intermingle and</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.280" end="01:25:24.320" style="s2">then i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.239" end="01:25:25.840" style="s2">actually the solutions are likely to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:26.880" style="s2">come because all of these people are</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.840" end="01:25:30.800" style="s2">talented</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.880" end="01:25:34.159" style="s2">and inventive and already connected</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.800" end="01:25:36.320" style="s2">and with more proper support</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.159" end="01:25:38.000" style="s2">they&#39;re likely to be more successful in</p>

<p begin="01:25:38.000" end="01:25:43.040" style="s2">meaning well they can get into uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.199" end="01:25:44.639" style="s2">politics if that that&#39;s what they want</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.040" end="01:25:47.679" style="s2">with the support of their</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.639" end="01:25:49.040" style="s2">like-minded people and a very very</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.679" end="01:25:53.199" style="s2">important part of this</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.040" end="01:25:55.920" style="s2">is to set up a really</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.199" end="01:25:56.719" style="s2">robust structure to protect the mental</p>

<p begin="01:26:00.000" end="01:26:06.800" style="s2">is that they keep flipping out</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.360" end="01:26:07.679" style="s2">and and here we are we&#39;re trying to save</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.800" end="01:26:10.639" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.679" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">we&#39;re chasing each other on the web</p>

<p begin="01:28:37.360" end="01:28:39.920" style="s2">and those few of us who started to break</p>

<p begin="01:28:45.120" end="01:28:48.560" style="s2">and some people</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.000" end="01:28:49.199" style="s2">can&#39;t and so building communities on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.560" end="01:28:51.360" style="s2">ground</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.199" end="01:28:53.600" style="s2">in which people are embedded in a</p>

<p begin="01:28:53.600" end="01:28:58.960" style="s2">strikes me as i can see why there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.679" end="01:29:00.880" style="s2">demand for that right now</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.960" end="01:29:02.800" style="s2">so i really like what you said before</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.880" end="01:29:05.600" style="s2">about uh politeness</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.800" end="01:29:06.880" style="s2">and i i think you know on on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.600" end="01:29:09.920" style="s2">modernist</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.880" end="01:29:10.320" style="s2">forum we only really have two rules and</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.920" end="01:29:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.320" end="01:29:17.520" style="s2">um kindness and respect and don&#39;t spam</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.920" end="01:29:20.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s it but then later on</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.520" end="01:29:22.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve added inofficial ones and it&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="01:29:22.800" end="01:29:29.120" style="s2">no uh magic and no nazis</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.480" end="01:29:29.840" style="s2">those are kind of an immune system um</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.120" end="01:29:33.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.840" end="01:29:37.040" style="s2">hey openness uh has a cost</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.760" end="01:29:40.880" style="s2">and there is you kind of have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.040" end="01:29:43.040" style="s2">a certain a certain cost to to imbue new</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.880" end="01:29:46.560" style="s2">information to respond and so on</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.040" end="01:29:50.080" style="s2">and we have to put some limits on it so</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.560" end="01:29:51.199" style="s2">to make this filter on open one but an</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.080" end="01:29:54.400" style="s2">effective one</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:54.800" style="s2">so that perspectives are drawn in widely</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.400" end="01:29:58.639" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.800" end="01:30:01.600" style="s2">but still still don&#39;t devolve</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.639" end="01:30:02.480" style="s2">right so these are these are perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.600" end="01:30:05.280" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.480" end="01:30:06.159" style="s2">at this point other than that there are</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.280" end="01:30:08.480" style="s2">certain norms</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.159" end="01:30:10.080" style="s2">that i think should be very important</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.480" end="01:30:13.360" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.080" end="01:30:15.520" style="s2">um there are rituals for many things in</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.360" end="01:30:16.320" style="s2">our societies but there&#39;s not a real</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.520" end="01:30:20.159" style="s2">ritual for</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.320" end="01:30:21.360" style="s2">honoring when somebody changes their</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.159" end="01:30:24.080" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.360" end="01:30:24.960" style="s2">rather we tend to lose prestige when we</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.080" end="01:30:27.840" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.960" end="01:30:28.560" style="s2">so somehow this this needs to be turned</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.840" end="01:30:31.120" style="s2">on its head</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.560" end="01:30:32.639" style="s2">should be an honorable thing to do to</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.120" end="01:30:34.560" style="s2">listen in</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.639" end="01:30:37.199" style="s2">take up somebody else&#39;s perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.560" end="01:30:40.000" style="s2">argument and change one&#39;s position</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.199" end="01:30:42.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean uh it doesn&#39;t mean being a</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.000" end="01:30:45.120" style="s2">pushover or anything like that</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.000" end="01:30:47.920" style="s2">it just means that we get stuck</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.120" end="01:30:48.639" style="s2">in all of these discussions which are</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.920" end="01:30:51.520" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.639" end="01:30:53.440" style="s2">necessarily conducive to creative</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.520" end="01:30:55.360" style="s2">solutions or to mental health for that</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.440" end="01:30:57.280" style="s2">matter or to good relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.360" end="01:31:01.199" style="s2">friendships</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.280" end="01:31:04.960" style="s2">but if we had a norm</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.199" end="01:31:06.960" style="s2">a strong norm which says it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.960" end="01:31:07.920" style="s2">change your opinion and you&#39;re expected</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.960" end="01:31:11.360" style="s2">to do so</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.920" end="01:31:14.800" style="s2">fairly often then we could</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.360" end="01:31:17.920" style="s2">evolve together more quickly really</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.800" end="01:31:20.000" style="s2">and and coordinate on a deeper level</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.920" end="01:31:22.080" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re explorers right and explorers</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.000" end="01:31:24.400" style="s2">expect to learn new things right</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.080" end="01:31:25.440" style="s2">i absolutely agree that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.400" end="01:31:27.360" style="s2">and of course this</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.440" end="01:31:28.800" style="s2">kind of weirdo thing called cancel</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.360" end="01:31:30.880" style="s2">culture is</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.800" end="01:31:32.719" style="s2">exactly an opposite of that right so</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.880" end="01:31:34.800" style="s2">they hang somebody from the lamp post</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.719" end="01:31:36.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s something i said in 1985</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.800" end="01:31:38.639" style="s2">right that&#39;s ridiculous people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.800" end="01:31:40.800" style="s2">who they were in 1985</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.639" end="01:31:42.800" style="s2">you know the world has changed a lot and</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.800" end="01:31:45.040" style="s2">so honoring the fact that we can</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.800" end="01:31:46.159" style="s2">can and do and should change over time i</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.040" end="01:31:49.440" style="s2">like that a lot as</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.159" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">kind of a meta ritual for this what</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.440" end="01:31:52.400" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:55.040" style="s2">next movement well i think we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.400" end="01:31:55.679" style="s2">kind of long here on time as we always</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.040" end="01:31:56.880" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.679" end="01:31:58.480" style="s2">but we always have such good</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.880" end="01:32:00.560" style="s2">conversations it&#39;s hard to keep them</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.480" end="01:32:02.480" style="s2">within the bounds of an hour and a half</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.560" end="01:32:04.159" style="s2">podcast but i think this has been an</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.480" end="01:32:06.320" style="s2">exceptionally rich and</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.159" end="01:32:07.280" style="s2">fruitful discussion i hope that we can</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.320" end="01:32:08.960" style="s2">continue to</p>
