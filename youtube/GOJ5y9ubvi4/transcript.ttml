<p begin="00:00:01.909" end="00:00:09.870" style="s2">one of my favorite online personalities</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.810" end="00:00:12.469" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen him in person names Kyle sees</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.870" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">I&#39;ve recommended him to people</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.469" end="00:00:17.190" style="s2">constantly because he&#39;s like a Tony</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">Robbins that brings humor to it had just</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.190" end="00:00:22.430" style="s2">in the sense of humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">authenticity he&#39;s part of the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.430" end="00:00:28.830" style="s2">am able to be online and authentic is</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:31.320" style="s2">because seeing him on stage kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.830" end="00:00:32.250" style="s2">without script and just going for it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.320" end="00:00:34.770" style="s2">he&#39;s much better at it</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.250" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">he&#39;s a comedian and an entertainer so he</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.770" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">can do that in the moment and maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">can&#39;t but knowing he&#39;s partly the reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">I&#39;m on an authenticity mission starting</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:49.710" style="s2">with his work about three years ago it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">probably when I when I found out about</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.710" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">him and in 2017 I went to a live event</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">of his in Los Angeles and at the time</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">his fiancee was pregnant very pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">sitting in the front row and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">about her like she is the love of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">life he finally found her they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:14.060" style="s2">finally able to have a baby and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">girl and now the daughter is almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.060" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">ob3 I guess this this summer and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">talks about them as a monogamous family</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:26.100" style="s2">unit</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">he definitely portrays that and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">woman has come forward saying that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">had a relationship with her for roughly</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">the last year and then multiple other</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">women had come forward with the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:43.130" style="s2">similar stories of him getting them to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">drink alcohol despite their sobriety I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.130" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">think a lot of these women have sexual</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">abuse in their history he they pay to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">at his events and then he you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">professes his love and sleeps with them</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">whether that story is true or not I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">I can imagine that in the highest order</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:03.719" style="s2">of that story if it is true is that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">was actually open and honest with all</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.719" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">the women in his life</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">and including hit the mother of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">child his fiancee that they&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:15.270" style="s2">open relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">he is you know what he says everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.270" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">just love and he&#39;s just loving all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:19.819" style="s2">women and you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">world he lives in</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.819" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">but even if he was honest with all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">those women and they knew exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">they stand her soul being a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">leader and plying them with alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:36.600" style="s2">skeezy and gross but that he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2">honest with the rest of us and his brand</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.600" end="00:02:42.330" style="s2">is authenticity his brand is yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:45.060" style="s2">everyone loves and everyone&#39;s evolving</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.330" end="00:02:48.300" style="s2">but that he&#39;s doing it in full view and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">that he is honest and open about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.300" end="00:02:53.640" style="s2">journey and this is a huge piece of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">journey so I get it humanity is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">ready for polyamory to be polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2">out in the open</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">costs something but if your brand is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:08.160" style="s2">authenticity and you&#39;re not open about</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:11.489" style="s2">that you&#39;re choosing profit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">choosing to have a million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.489" end="00:03:19.290" style="s2">company over your integrity and that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:20.610" style="s2">and yet it makes sense to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.290" end="00:03:22.200" style="s2">how do you have staff how do you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.610" end="00:03:24.269" style="s2">how do you reach this number of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.200" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re out in the open about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.269" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">kind of thing I&#39;m not saying he is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:28.829" style="s2">polyamorous in any way but like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:30.329" style="s2">the highest level that I can give him if</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.829" end="00:03:32.940" style="s2">this if these stories are in any way</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.329" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">true which based on the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.940" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">authenticity to have been following him</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:40.079" style="s2">I can&#39;t imagine this was one never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">come to light because when you preach</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.079" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">authenticity and people have that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:46.700" style="s2">them they&#39;re gonna eventually be</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:51.570" style="s2">authentic like the truth will come out I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.700" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">could have seen this unfolding it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.570" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">something that somewhere along that line</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:59.340" style="s2">someone has to claim yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">word but even if he&#39;s probably amorous</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.340" end="00:04:02.880" style="s2">right that like yes we were in a poly</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:04.079" style="s2">blasian ship his wife knew about it we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.880" end="00:04:05.910" style="s2">all knew about it but I feel little</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.079" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">dupes because there was a shrinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.910" end="00:04:11.940" style="s2">involved and this misalignment of power</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">and yet as a society that is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.940" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">masculine feminine so that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.440" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">whole other video element of itself but</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">when you have a community that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:25.180" style="s2">branded on authenticity but even more so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:29.139" style="s2">when it&#39;s around is one leader like Kyle</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.180" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">he&#39;s evolving out loud community then</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.139" end="00:04:33.340" style="s2">when they fall from grace</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:34.900" style="s2">especially around their branding right</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:37.240" style="s2">when it&#39;s like oh you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.900" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">authentic then the community falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.240" end="00:04:43.449" style="s2">much more readily than if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:45.789" style="s2">that that structure what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.449" end="00:04:49.660" style="s2">my community my physical eat with them</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.789" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">community with this woman this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.660" end="00:04:55.479" style="s2">interactions not gonna make the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">community fall apart because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.479" end="00:05:00.430" style="s2">dependent on either her or I be in there</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:02.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not dependent on our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.430" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">the only way it would make the community</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.349" end="00:05:06.070" style="s2">fall apart is if it was pushed under the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:08.110" style="s2">rug</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:09.669" style="s2">kept in secrecy she kept doing that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.110" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">other people everyone like there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.669" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">things that could fracture it for sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:16.780" style="s2">around this but with authenticity with</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">openness and transparency and with</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.780" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">people willing to be part of that if she</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want it to be transparent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">clear because there&#39;s power in oh wait I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">acted horribly and I don&#39;t want anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:29.409" style="s2">to know so I can still act horribly and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:31.389" style="s2">still nobody knows and still act</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.409" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">horribly and still nobody knows keeping</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.389" end="00:05:38.169" style="s2">it secret because their shame involved</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.370" end="00:05:40.389" style="s2">and shame can break things whereas out</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.169" end="00:05:43.300" style="s2">in the open at least you are owning it</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.389" end="00:05:44.919" style="s2">like even if you&#39;re not by choice this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.300" end="00:05:48.099" style="s2">thing happened or you&#39;re dying at and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.919" end="00:05:49.599" style="s2">saying it didn&#39;t happen but like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.099" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">something about having a central leader</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.599" end="00:05:57.099" style="s2">versus a dispersed interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:58.630" style="s2">community where it&#39;s not the like leader</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.099" end="00:06:00.460" style="s2">in their relationship and their</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.630" end="00:06:04.780" style="s2">relationships other people like you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.460" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">a pyramid it&#39;s more of a molecule more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.780" end="00:06:10.440" style="s2">like this connection and this connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:14.520" style="s2">and Dunbar&#39;s number of connections and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.440" end="00:06:17.050" style="s2">that is the resiliency of community so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.520" end="00:06:21.669" style="s2">that is I&#39;m sitting with a lot of of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.050" end="00:06:23.349" style="s2">just I&#39;m not angry not even like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.669" end="00:06:25.180" style="s2">disappointment but like this awakening</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.349" end="00:06:26.530" style="s2">and understanding of like oh this is why</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.180" end="00:06:28.060" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to sense a leader even</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.530" end="00:06:29.889" style="s2">though society wants a central leader</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.060" end="00:06:31.449" style="s2">and it&#39;s like and then the central</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.889" end="00:06:32.620" style="s2">leader can&#39;t be authentic and open</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.449" end="00:06:34.060" style="s2">because they wouldn&#39;t have as much of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.620" end="00:06:38.020" style="s2">following and couldn&#39;t have as much</p>
