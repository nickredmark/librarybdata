<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.840" style="s2">but you&#39;ve mentioned it several times</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.520" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">now and frankly i&#39;m not entirely clear</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:07.600" style="s2">what you mean by it</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:09.200" style="s2">so i&#39;d love for you to take a five</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.600" end="00:00:10.000" style="s2">minutes no longer i&#39;m gonna blow the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.200" end="00:00:13.040" style="s2">whistle</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.000" end="00:00:14.920" style="s2">on meaning what does meaning mean and</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.040" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">what is it to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.920" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">meaningful five minutes on</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">meaningfulness so</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.920" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">five minutes so i&#39;m gonna start now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:22.800" style="s2">gonna rely on old school skills and do a</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">compression</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:26.960" style="s2">so first is uh in bed reference to john</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">verveigh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.960" end="00:00:30.800" style="s2">you know 43 hour series on escaping from</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">go watch that you will then have a much</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">better sense of what that means</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">but to say john has a good framework so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll use that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.120" end="00:00:42.399" style="s2">as well as i can four ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:45.440" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">procedural perspectival participatory</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.440" end="00:00:48.320" style="s2">and and they&#39;re in a stack which is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:49.520" style="s2">say that participatory is more</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.320" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.520" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">and propositional is um more</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">rapidly changeable you can you can move</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">propositions around faster propositions</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">like what we&#39;re doing right now language</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">i&#39;m conveying language to you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">absorbing language and to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">you&#39;re moving your ideas around</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">in relationship to what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">has to do with it&#39;s almost like the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:13.119" style="s2">fitness</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">of your way of being in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.119" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">the world that you&#39;re in so if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">actually use just evolutionary fitness</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">and extend that to include the whole way</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">that a human can be in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">with the the kinds of niches that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">that&#39;s where meaningfulness comes from</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">that is meaningfulness so meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">the wholeness of your entire mode of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:39.280" style="s2">all the different ways that you respond</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">to what is coming at you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.280" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">that gives rise to your increasing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:45.439" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">to respond well to what is in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">so meaningfulness is simultaneously the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:51.040" style="s2">means to the end</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:53.680" style="s2">of being able to respond to the world in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.040" end="00:01:55.600" style="s2">a way that furthers your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">respond to the world in the next moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.600" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">of time that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">you are fit in that sense um</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">and also it is the the capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">of how you sense what kinds of changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">are more affordable to increasing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">capacity does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">almost what exactly is the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">let&#39;s make that clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">the language i think of platinus talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">about the notion of conformation</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">to conform so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">pistol let&#39;s do that i have a pistol in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">front of me</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a glock actually and so what i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">notice is there&#39;s a way for my hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">to be configured so that my hand is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">holding this glock in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">actually able to pull the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">effectively does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">yep that is a very large number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">that my hand can be conformed that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">in conformity with with the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">affordance of the pistol</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">so meaningfulness is simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">on the one hand the practical which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">if i get my hand in the right conformity</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">to the pistol i can actually pull the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">trigger and in fact if i get it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">my whole body in the right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">with that with the affordance of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">pistol i can actually shoot with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">right so that&#39;s meaningfulness from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">point of view of effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">in in world in relationship to what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">world is offering</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">meaningfulness which is the how do i go</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">about figuring that [ __ ] out</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">well what i notice is that if i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">experiment with it there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">about the way that i know i&#39;m holding</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">the gun upside down if i&#39;ve got like all</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">my fingers stuck together like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">mitt there&#39;s something in me that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">telling me that that ain&#39;t the right way</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">and so the sense of meaningfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">the capacity to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">discern in reality in this case with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">pistol</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">what are the affordances of that pistol</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">and how does my capacity as a body</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:39.440" style="s2">relate to those affordances and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">change myself to conform to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">so as to increasingly realize a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">be an effective relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">reality now expand</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">pistol to be the whole [ __ ] world so</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">essentially you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">uh meaning is figuring [ __ ] out</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">yes figuring out how to actually live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">well which is to say by well what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">is not just to live</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">now but to live ongoingly right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">just this double order i have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">be in effective relationship with what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">the world is throwing at me now</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">but by effective relationship what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">mean is that what i do</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">how i how i actually show up increases</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">my possibility of being in an effective</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">relationship with what the world is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">throwing at me in the future</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">that&#39;s it okay i&#39;m gonna push back a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">one could argue that in the current</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">world that would say to be meaningful is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">to become a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">very good game a player well</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">if game a was in fact a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">valid future then that would be true</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">and it was at some point so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">time that being meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">was figuring out what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">affordances of game a and getting damn</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">good at it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">for a period of time that was very true</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">and this is actually quite challenging</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">remember i said this is i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">actually a very interesting piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">when i said the game b is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">omnipresent but we may be playing it at</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">i mean that quite seriously i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">like 35 000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">game b was present but gay man game b</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">are co-present and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">really interesting tension that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">feel in ourselves that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">as we sort of follow the meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">vector in the direction of game a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">we can notice a a tension or a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">integrity a fragmentation of ourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">in relationship to the meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">inspector in the direction of game b</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">because there&#39;s a discontinuity between</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">the two</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">and i think that is is really really a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">point like it speaks to why we may have</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">a subjective sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">the [ __ ] is rut talking about or what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">paul talking about when he says that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">to play game a well was meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">in say the 1950s or say the 1300s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s because in in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">larger scheme of things right we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">doing this this human thing for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">million years and so the 35 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">where game a was a certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">had a certain conformity to it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">a blink of the eye so</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">we might say is that our deep deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">sense of meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">has kind of always felt that game a has</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">this taste of short-termism a taste of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">making trade-offs between things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">maybe they are the right trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">maybe i have to make those trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">i want to continue to be able to play</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">the game but i also feel a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">wrongness to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">and so one of the things we might say is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">that the fulfillment of game b</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">is a recovery of that and moving back</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">into an alignment that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">even our evolutionary selves can feel is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">ah</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">now i no longer have to in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">pursue this path of what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">i can actually pursue a path that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">feeling increasingly meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">all the way down and all the way out</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">which is a very nice orientation</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">essentially you talk about the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">wrongness</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">that keeps popping up and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">give two good examples</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">that were actually pretty major and had</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">some result in game a and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">and twice challenged game a one</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">is marx&#39;s idea of alienation you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.520" end="00:07:08.639" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:10.479" style="s2">the ever crunching machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.639" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">capitalism while it delivers the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.479" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">productive goods at least for</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">many people alienates people from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">holistic approach</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">to life and work and he predicted would</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">uh realize uh that they were alienated</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">and revolt and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">in reality it turned out game a was good</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">enough at buying them out off</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">from their alienation that uh they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">so far willing to remain alienated the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">i think closely related concept again a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">sense of wrongness</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">was from the uh 60s call it the hippie</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">movement or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:44.280" style="s2">whatever it was was going on in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">the word there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.280" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">inauthenticity that people were walking</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">away from and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">you know a lot of people about my age</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">especially one just a little teeny bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">older got decent college educations and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">walked away and you know built hippy</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">communes so to speak to try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">achieve more authenticity in their life</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">you know the feeling that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">putting on the gray flannel suit and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">going to work in the big bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">uh behemoths was not an authentic way</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">of honoring our being as creatures in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">yeah those both sort of i think get it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">your sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">absolutely and we can say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">one of the words that i think rings very</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">nicely</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">now in this context of meaningfulness as</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve described it is integrity</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">and here integrity has a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">landscaping quite nicely we think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">it like</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">structural integrity which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">all of the pieces are fitting together</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">so alienation is fragmentation where</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">okay i&#39;ve got some pieces that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">fitting together while there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">other bunch of pieces that are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s what alienation is right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">inauthenticity is kind of the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">and so in this perspective we can look</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">meta level like oh wow so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">orientation towards meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">includes within itself an awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">all the different pieces of myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">and in fact by the way of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">world that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">not in integrity they are not in right</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">relationship with each other and by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">therefore have less structural integrity</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">as we begin to be aware of this we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">like okay yeah those guys were picking</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">things up and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">we can run back in time and see this</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">happening all the time like constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">we were noticing</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">that the trade-offs that we were forced</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">to make by the reality of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">we were in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s just been the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">reality whether it was the trade-off of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">which of your children dies because you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">haven&#39;t got enough food or the reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">of you&#39;re going to kill that other</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">sentient human being because you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">war whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">is a separation from a larger integrity</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">a larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">movement of meaningfulness that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">subject to the contingencies of now</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">but we feel in ourselves a wrongness to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like a pragmatic acceptance now of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be very aware of how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">we move more and more in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">of a greater and greater rightness</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">non-utopian right i&#39;m not ex proposing</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">by any stretch of the imagination either</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to be able to teleport</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">from here</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">to there we have to actually grow our</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">capacity to include more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">of ourselves and the world in this</p>
