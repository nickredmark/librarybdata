<p begin="00:00:01.979" end="00:00:05.879" style="s2">lecturer at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.020" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">from the department&#39;s of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.879" end="00:00:11.010" style="s2">cognitive science and Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">psychology he&#39;s done a few TED Talks and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.010" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">he&#39;s rising in popularity now for work</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">on a meaning crisis and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.400" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to focus on today so first</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:30.900" style="s2">of all what is the meaning crisis so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:33.450" style="s2">meaning crisis is an intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.900" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">sort of perennial problems that human</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.450" end="00:00:39.320" style="s2">beings face and some specific historical</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">circumstances that we&#39;re in in the West</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.320" end="00:00:45.530" style="s2">the perennial problems are basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">under an umbrella the idea is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.530" end="00:00:50.250" style="s2">cognitive processes that make us</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">adaptive that give us our intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.250" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">to put a a single turn on it term on it</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">also are the very same processes that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">make us continually prone and libel to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">self deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">so across cultures and crossed</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">historical context people have come up</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">with various sets of practices for</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:18.710" style="s2">trying to ameliorate those aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">self-deception and self-destruction and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.710" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">in addition what they try to do is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:28.939" style="s2">only ameliorate the way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">self-destructive self-deceptive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.939" end="00:01:36.470" style="s2">makes us fit our environment maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">ly maybe connect to our own agency</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.470" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">maladaptive ly connect to other people</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">maladaptive ly connect to our particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">circumstances maladaptive Li not only</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">those practices try to ameliorate that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">they try to also do the reverse in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">addition to reducing the foolishness of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">self-deception they try to afford an</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:58.670" style="s2">enhanced sense of connectedness so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">one feels one is fully alive fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.670" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">agentic fully connected to the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">fully connected to others fully</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:11.430" style="s2">connected to a course of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:13.879" style="s2">and growth and development and so those</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.430" end="00:02:15.980" style="s2">sets of practices that ameliorate</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.879" end="00:02:18.230" style="s2">foolishness and afford meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.980" end="00:02:22.909" style="s2">there broadly understood as wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.230" end="00:02:26.659" style="s2">practices and what&#39;s happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.909" end="00:02:27.950" style="s2">West is for various historical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.659" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">and now we have shift from the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.950" end="00:02:33.950" style="s2">problems to the historical factors</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:36.500" style="s2">reverse historical reasons a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.950" end="00:02:39.950" style="s2">that gave us an understanding of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.500" end="00:02:41.569" style="s2">practices valorized them gave us</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.950" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">guidance gave us established</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.569" end="00:02:48.980" style="s2">institutions and traditions basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:51.889" style="s2">that had you know a wisdom culture for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.980" end="00:02:54.290" style="s2">us has largely disappeared so well of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.889" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">course we have tremendous knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.290" end="00:02:58.639" style="s2">information progress if that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:02.569" style="s2">word I might call it into question later</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.639" end="00:03:05.629" style="s2">but we we have very much a wisdom famine</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.569" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">and so people have very shallow</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.629" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">resources in general for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:12.129" style="s2">self-deception till self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:16.549" style="s2">behavior and for enhancing and affording</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.129" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">increased meaning in life and those</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.549" end="00:03:21.019" style="s2">historical forces are complex and I go</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:23.750" style="s2">over them at length in the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.019" end="00:03:26.810" style="s2">crisis but we are basically suffering a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:30.430" style="s2">wisdom and meaning famine because we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.810" end="00:03:35.060" style="s2">don&#39;t have a worldview that tells us how</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.430" end="00:03:36.620" style="s2">our wisdom practices should fit together</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.060" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">I wish you&#39;d collect them how we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.620" end="00:03:40.729" style="s2">curate them how we should correct them</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.530" style="s2">how we should communicate them with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.729" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">other we don&#39;t have a worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.530" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">gives us a cognitive existential and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.150" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">even ultimately sort of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.799" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">grounding for our cultivations of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">and meaning so we have this scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">worldview in which we don&#39;t find any</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:03.799" style="s2">kind of home so Christopher master</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">Pietro and Philip mr. that can I call</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.799" end="00:04:07.010" style="s2">this kind of like a cultural Dhamma side</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:09.949" style="s2">Dhamma side is when you lose your sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.010" end="00:04:12.470" style="s2">of being at home of belonging of fitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.949" end="00:04:14.509" style="s2">fitting in not in the conformity sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.470" end="00:04:16.549" style="s2">but fitting being in continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.509" end="00:04:20.630" style="s2">contact with what&#39;s real and what really</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.549" end="00:04:21.769" style="s2">matters and so there&#39;s two aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.630" end="00:04:23.029" style="s2">the meaning crisis there&#39;s a perennial</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.769" end="00:04:24.830" style="s2">one and you&#39;ll see it in literature</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.029" end="00:04:26.810" style="s2">across the ages people worry about</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.830" end="00:04:27.470" style="s2">falling into despair or finding life</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.810" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">empty</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:33.140" style="s2">way that things are meaningless and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:34.970" style="s2">what&#39;s happened is the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.140" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">responses to that have been seriously</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.970" end="00:04:39.230" style="s2">undermined in a culture for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:46.810" style="s2">historical reasons and then they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.230" end="00:04:52.340" style="s2">exacerbated and accelerated increase of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.810" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">a technological framing of of who we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.340" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">and what the world is we see everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">basically as objects and resources to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.360" end="00:05:01.700" style="s2">manipulated and controlled and then that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">aligns with you know a pervasive market</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.700" end="00:05:06.610" style="s2">mentality in which the only sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:12.590" style="s2">normative Authority that still left is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.610" end="00:05:15.080" style="s2">the market for people a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.590" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">everything being commodified everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.080" end="00:05:19.640" style="s2">being as everything&#39;s being sold and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:21.670" style="s2">there&#39;s and I&#39;ll use this term in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.640" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">technical sense there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.670" end="00:05:28.130" style="s2">everywhere and and this has pervaded our</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:31.190" style="s2">political and cultural arena so not only</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.130" end="00:05:35.450" style="s2">do we are we wisdom and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.190" end="00:05:37.790" style="s2">impoverished we also feel a set by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.450" end="00:05:40.940" style="s2">of forces that seem to be degrading our</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.790" end="00:05:42.020" style="s2">basic sense of our humanity so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.940" end="00:05:46.460" style="s2">what I would call the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.020" end="00:05:49.490" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a great start I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.460" end="00:05:52.610" style="s2">summarize it or super simplify it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.490" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">sure so if I simplify it too much you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.610" end="00:05:57.080" style="s2">can let me know and we&#39;ll work at it I</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:06:00.710" style="s2">want to get like I want to get really</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.080" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">shortly okay you know because</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.710" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">potentially I could actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:07.610" style="s2">talk to my students about this we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">middle school although it like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.610" end="00:06:13.010" style="s2">mentioned the West earlier and I it does</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:15.350" style="s2">seem like this is not really happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.010" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">in the East although maybe it&#39;s starting</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.350" end="00:06:19.430" style="s2">to happen it&#39;s definitely happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:21.530" style="s2">Japan it&#39;s definitely happening in Japan</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.430" end="00:06:23.900" style="s2">so you see the next generation coming up</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.530" end="00:06:26.300" style="s2">but there&#39;s a whole class of people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.900" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">have sort of retreated from society of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.300" end="00:06:30.350" style="s2">young people and retreated into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:32.810" style="s2">virtual world because they find that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.350" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">world has many of the features that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.810" end="00:06:38.750" style="s2">real world is lacking for them so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:41.340" style="s2">definitely the case in Japan but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.750" end="00:06:45.180" style="s2">know about other places</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.340" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">in the in the East okay okay excellent</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.180" end="00:06:50.100" style="s2">so and yeah I agree there definitely</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:53.660" style="s2">seems to be something happening in Japan</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.100" end="00:06:56.669" style="s2">there okay so um you used the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.660" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">cognitive faculties I think I will just</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.669" end="00:07:03.199" style="s2">I would just summarize that as maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:06.180" style="s2">mind it&#39;s like sure we have a mind and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.199" end="00:07:07.169" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an incredible tool it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.180" end="00:07:09.690" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.169" end="00:07:13.500" style="s2">alright I&#39;m already talking too much we</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.690" end="00:07:16.169" style="s2">have a mind it can it can help us to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.500" end="00:07:19.310" style="s2">grow and connect with the world or we</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.169" end="00:07:23.700" style="s2">can use it badly and then our life</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.310" end="00:07:27.650" style="s2">similarly turns for the worse and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.700" end="00:07:35.180" style="s2">we we also have this you know culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.650" end="00:07:39.180" style="s2">and mythos mythology that that can help</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.180" end="00:07:43.139" style="s2">that not only gives us the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.180" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">properly use our mind but like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.139" end="00:07:49.590" style="s2">narrative framework so that we know who</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:53.930" style="s2">we are and what we&#39;re doing why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.590" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">here and the meaning crisis is is most</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.930" end="00:08:04.770" style="s2">specifically the dissolution of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:09.349" style="s2">kind of culture the wisdom culture yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.770" end="00:08:12.510" style="s2">yeah very much yeah fine with that okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.349" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna try and simplify it even</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.510" end="00:08:21.960" style="s2">more now</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:24.450" style="s2">okay there&#39;s wisdom that&#39;s good and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.960" end="00:08:28.500" style="s2">also know that lack of wisdom is bad and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.450" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">there needs to be a culture for of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.500" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">wisdom and for wisdom so that as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:39.029" style="s2">society we can stick together and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">wisdom culture is rapidly decaying in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.029" end="00:08:46.040" style="s2">the West and other places yes although</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:49.020" style="s2">there are clear signs of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.040" end="00:08:50.250" style="s2">increasingly trying to revive it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.020" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">there&#39;s so there&#39;s sort of negative</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.250" end="00:08:54.270" style="s2">symptoms of the meaning crisis the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:55.080" style="s2">people are suffering a loss of agency</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.270" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">and suffering a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.080" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">a sense of belonging to being there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:01.230" style="s2">the negative symptoms but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2">positive symptoms in which you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.230" end="00:09:05.490" style="s2">people trying to bring back stoicism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:07.650" style="s2">create these these like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.490" end="00:09:09.330" style="s2">having right now these new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.650" end="00:09:11.100" style="s2">carrying out you know what I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.330" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">ultimately call philosophical discourse</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.100" end="00:09:14.310" style="s2">we&#39;re not just talking we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:15.990" style="s2">doing something you know to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.310" end="00:09:17.370" style="s2">something done we&#39;re trying to work on</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.990" end="00:09:19.020" style="s2">the meaning of things and the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.370" end="00:09:21.030" style="s2">who and what we are so I mean it in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.020" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">sense that ancient sense of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.030" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">but I sometimes call philosophy a-- and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:28.020" style="s2">so you see also uh you know and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:29.730" style="s2">the mindfulness revolution there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.020" end="00:09:32.670" style="s2">criticisms of it but it&#39;s nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.730" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">people are trying to put together wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.670" end="00:09:39.330" style="s2">practices now what we&#39;re discovering is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:43.800" style="s2">that because again of our particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.330" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">historical past we&#39;re tending to do this</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.800" end="00:09:49.080" style="s2">in a very fragmented and autodidactic</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.860" end="00:09:50.790" style="s2">and egocentric way which everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.080" end="00:09:53.580" style="s2">sort of on their own trying to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.790" end="00:09:56.070" style="s2">their own little wisdom philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.580" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">wisdom religion and and you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.070" end="00:10:01.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t wanna I don&#39;t wanna I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">to just completely dismiss that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.530" end="00:10:04.440" style="s2">people are trying to ameliorate their</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:08.940" style="s2">suffering and afford meaning and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.440" end="00:10:10.530" style="s2">a good thing but you know the worst</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.940" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">things can come from the best things</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.530" end="00:10:16.340" style="s2">turned bad what I mean by that is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.990" style="s2">tends to create a really fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.340" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">autodidact ism fragments us from other</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.990" end="00:10:23.310" style="s2">people so we can&#39;t we need we have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:25.530" style="s2">work collectively to build an</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.310" end="00:10:27.300" style="s2">alternative worldview right the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.530" end="00:10:29.610" style="s2">that you know the idea that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.300" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">your own worldview I think is a serious</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.610" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">form of because it&#39;s it refer</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.000" end="00:10:39.150" style="s2">it sort of ramps up that that that ego</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:41.970" style="s2">centrism and that being locked inside</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.150" end="00:10:45.150" style="s2">your head and your own subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.970" end="00:10:47.550" style="s2">breeds narcissism and other things like</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.150" end="00:10:49.950" style="s2">that because when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.550" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">autodidactic all those proclivities</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.950" end="00:10:52.950" style="s2">towards self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:56.520" style="s2">self-destructive behavior don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.950" end="00:10:59.550" style="s2">anything counterbalancing them oh one</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.520" end="00:11:03.900" style="s2">second just give me your definition of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:04.830" style="s2">autodidactic autodidactic is you do it</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.900" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">on your own</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.830" end="00:11:10.650" style="s2">without entering into any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:14.370" style="s2">sustained community or tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.650" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">provides you with a framework that can</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.370" end="00:11:18.780" style="s2">be obscene as more encompassing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.760" end="00:11:24.750" style="s2">challenging to your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.780" end="00:11:28.080" style="s2">egocentric framework so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.750" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">what&#39;s the opposite of autodidactic the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.080" end="00:11:36.900" style="s2">opposite of autodidactic would be to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:39.750" style="s2">belong to community with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">tradition some kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.750" end="00:11:45.180" style="s2">intelligence being shared amongst</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:47.970" style="s2">distributed cognition so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.180" end="00:11:51.570" style="s2">collectively create these ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.970" end="00:11:56.030" style="s2">practices and create an a an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.570" end="00:11:57.380" style="s2">worldview that will properly hone them</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.030" end="00:12:00.180" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.380" end="00:12:01.500" style="s2">that&#39;s why these discussions are so</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.180" end="00:12:05.130" style="s2">important and part of what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.500" end="00:12:08.010" style="s2">right now in a particular crisis were in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.130" end="00:12:09.270" style="s2">with the virus right is we one of the I</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.010" end="00:12:11.700" style="s2">mean and I don&#39;t want to make light of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.270" end="00:12:13.800" style="s2">this people are dying it&#39;s I take that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.700" end="00:12:15.330" style="s2">seriously so I&#39;m not trying to put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.800" end="00:12:16.860" style="s2">aside but that&#39;s not the core of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.330" end="00:12:19.020" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here so I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.860" end="00:12:20.580" style="s2">for people to understand that right but</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.020" end="00:12:23.430" style="s2">one of the things that it&#39;s revealing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.580" end="00:12:25.560" style="s2">people is how much how actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.430" end="00:12:29.550" style="s2">important because it was so back rounded</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.560" end="00:12:31.770" style="s2">but how much connecting to others in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.550" end="00:12:33.750" style="s2">significant way and working with others</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.770" end="00:12:37.290" style="s2">and being present with others how much</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.750" end="00:12:39.450" style="s2">it really matters to us how deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.290" end="00:12:41.820" style="s2">we tended look we walked around outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.450" end="00:12:45.330" style="s2">and we were like inside but can blocked</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.820" end="00:12:47.100" style="s2">in and then we&#39;re realizing oh Jesus I</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.330" end="00:12:50.220" style="s2">actually don&#39;t want to be locked in like</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.100" end="00:12:52.890" style="s2">that I really need to connect to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.220" end="00:12:55.530" style="s2">world to get outside of the prison of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.890" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">own ego to can open myself up to other</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.530" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">people in you know in in various degrees</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:06.690" style="s2">of depth and and so I think what what</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:08.460" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is how important that kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.690" end="00:13:11.460" style="s2">of deep connectedness really is it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.460" end="00:13:16.170" style="s2">it&#39;s been so back rounded by our</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.460" end="00:13:18.780" style="s2">busyness and by our technology and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:20.700" style="s2">the crisis is revealing how in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.780" end="00:13:22.290" style="s2">important it is and how actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.700" end="00:13:24.510" style="s2">going to be something we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.290" end="00:13:30.630" style="s2">enhance if we want to get through this</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.510" end="00:13:32.910" style="s2">in the best possible way okay I do want</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.630" end="00:13:35.250" style="s2">to talk about stoicism and my own</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.910" end="00:13:38.220" style="s2">personal experience there but the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.250" end="00:13:41.370" style="s2">I feel like I should stick to my word</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.220" end="00:13:45.780" style="s2">with what I said in our re first email</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.370" end="00:13:47.820" style="s2">exchange the second question how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.780" end="00:13:52.650" style="s2">get out of the meaning crisis and so to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.820" end="00:13:56.790" style="s2">use our earlier definition how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.650" end="00:13:59.400" style="s2">I guess bring back a wisdom culture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.790" end="00:14:01.590" style="s2">well I mean the there&#39;s two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.400" end="00:14:03.180" style="s2">thinking you should do that one is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.590" end="00:14:05.430" style="s2">you might call a top-down where</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.180" end="00:14:08.010" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gonna construct some system</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.430" end="00:14:11.820" style="s2">where religion and then impose it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.010" end="00:14:12.750" style="s2">people the other is to just sort of hope</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.820" end="00:14:14.790" style="s2">that things are going to percolate</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.750" end="00:14:16.650" style="s2">bottom-up various groups of people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.790" end="00:14:18.710" style="s2">gonna somehow start forming communities</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.650" end="00:14:22.440" style="s2">get together I think both of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.710" end="00:14:24.060" style="s2">Express ood exclusively as a mistake so</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.440" end="00:14:25.710" style="s2">one of the things we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.060" end="00:14:28.200" style="s2">there&#39;s all these emerging communities</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.710" end="00:14:31.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s great but we need to get them</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.200" end="00:14:34.170" style="s2">talking and not only do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.380" end="00:14:36.090" style="s2">improve the depth of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.170" end="00:14:37.860" style="s2">talking about we need to improve the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.090" end="00:14:39.930" style="s2">depth of how they&#39;re talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.860" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">other so I&#39;m doing a lot of work with</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:49.590" style="s2">people right and you see a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.280" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">not you know I taught forms like rebel</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.590" end="00:14:59.450" style="s2">wisdom and future thinkers voice Club</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:15:05.100" style="s2">where people are trying to transform how</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.450" end="00:15:08.250" style="s2">we use dialog to afford the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.100" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">of wisdom and use that as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.250" end="00:15:15.990" style="s2">trying to start to create a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:19.310" style="s2">can then act as a home within which we</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.990" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">can collect curate correct and vet</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.310" end="00:15:23.910" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s of practices now that brings</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.020" end="00:15:27.210" style="s2">me to the second point I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.910" end="00:15:31.170" style="s2">should look for one practice one thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.210" end="00:15:32.400" style="s2">to do to ameliorate the meaning crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.170" end="00:15:34.170" style="s2">think you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.400" end="00:15:36.120" style="s2">a bunch of things I need I think you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.170" end="00:15:37.830" style="s2">need no first of all you need this kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.120" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">of practice what I call the Chris and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.830" end="00:15:43.980" style="s2">called dialectic where you really put</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:45.330" style="s2">dialog so we can just talk and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.980" end="00:15:46.890" style="s2">dialogue is when we&#39;re trying to connect</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.330" end="00:15:48.420" style="s2">and then dialectic is where we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.890" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">to collect connect so we can do</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.420" end="00:15:53.420" style="s2">philosophy it together so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">cultivate wisdom together right right</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.420" end="00:15:58.860" style="s2">dialectic obviously to create that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:16:01.350" style="s2">cultural home but we also need you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.860" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">meditative practices contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.350" end="00:16:07.740" style="s2">practices movement practices right so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:08.970" style="s2">need you know that&#39;s why I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.740" end="00:16:11.670" style="s2">people like Rafe Kelly and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.970" end="00:16:13.620" style="s2">extraordinary work he&#39;s doing on putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.670" end="00:16:16.970" style="s2">together you know what ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.620" end="00:16:20.400" style="s2">practices and his evolved move play</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.970" end="00:16:22.350" style="s2">framework so we need to create ecologies</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.400" end="00:16:24.600" style="s2">of practices because no one practiced</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.350" end="00:16:27.390" style="s2">your cognition your mind is such an</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.600" end="00:16:29.640" style="s2">incredibly dynamic and self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.390" end="00:16:30.900" style="s2">thing right you need you need something</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.640" end="00:16:32.430" style="s2">you need a set of practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.900" end="00:16:34.890" style="s2">also incredibly dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.430" end="00:16:37.260" style="s2">self-organizing to properly try to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.890" end="00:16:39.960" style="s2">transform your mind in the comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.260" end="00:16:42.710" style="s2">and deep way we need to in order to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.960" end="00:16:45.300" style="s2">start ameliorating the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.710" end="00:16:50.340" style="s2">excellent and just to add on to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.300" end="00:16:53.310" style="s2">last point so you know you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.340" end="00:16:55.380" style="s2">about an ecology of practices which it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:16:57.780" style="s2">kind of reminds me of like diversifying</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.380" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">a portfolio that might be a bad analogy</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.780" end="00:17:06.510" style="s2">but another effective method for me has</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:10.800" style="s2">been finding one practice and then kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.510" end="00:17:12.980" style="s2">of like like doing it in as many</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.800" end="00:17:15.810" style="s2">different ways as possible yep</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.980" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">introduced variation I mean that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.810" end="00:17:20.730" style="s2">you watched little kids that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:22.560" style="s2">learn right so if they&#39;re doing some</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.730" end="00:17:25.500" style="s2">tasks they&#39;ll come up with a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.560" end="00:17:26.850" style="s2">that solves the task solves the problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.500" end="00:17:28.380" style="s2">gets them to the goal but they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.850" end="00:17:29.580" style="s2">initially stick with that what they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.380" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">do is they&#39;ll create all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.580" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">variations alternative strategies and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">then they&#39;ll put them into competition</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:37.710" style="s2">with each other in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:40.020" style="s2">maybe efficiency or which one most</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.710" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">pleases mom or which one best connects</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.020" end="00:17:43.380" style="s2">them to their peers and so they do</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:46.350" style="s2">something that&#39;s very analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.380" end="00:17:48.870" style="s2">biological evolution right they will</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.350" end="00:17:50.250" style="s2">dude variation and then they&#39;ll put some</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.870" end="00:17:51.660" style="s2">selective pressure on it until they</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.250" end="00:17:53.850" style="s2">settle onto a strategy and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.660" end="00:17:57.150" style="s2">vary on that again by the way I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.850" end="00:17:58.620" style="s2">that&#39;s an important model for how your</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.150" end="00:18:01.080" style="s2">how your cognition how your mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.620" end="00:18:03.780" style="s2">fundamentally gets a grip on the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.080" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">is that process of variation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.780" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">selection and evolve continually</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:10.140" style="s2">evolving it&#39;s fitted &#39;no stew the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:12.120" style="s2">and so i think that is exactly how you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.140" end="00:18:14.520" style="s2">should so not only should you have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.120" end="00:18:16.190" style="s2">call so you should have practices that</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:18.270" style="s2">have complimentary sets and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.190" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">right we talked about that a minute ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.270" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">then you should do what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:24.420" style="s2">you should evolve each practice and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:25.860" style="s2">should also think about practices that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.420" end="00:18:28.260" style="s2">Ridgid bridge between the various</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.860" end="00:18:29.990" style="s2">practices that help you better sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.260" end="00:18:32.430" style="s2">transition from one context to another</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.990" end="00:18:35.300" style="s2">okay that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.430" end="00:18:38.910" style="s2">but we still need the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.300" end="00:18:41.880" style="s2">culture for the wisdom culture and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.910" end="00:18:44.250" style="s2">can&#39;t do that as an individual yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.880" end="00:18:45.900" style="s2">culture is not something trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.250" end="00:18:47.220" style="s2">invent your own culture with you is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.900" end="00:18:49.980" style="s2">trying to invent your own language it</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.220" end="00:18:52.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.980" end="00:18:55.680" style="s2">any sense it&#39;s a deeply mistaken thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.440" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">to do yeah right and so the only way</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.680" end="00:19:01.290" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do that is if we become</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">aware if we if we give up the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.290" end="00:19:06.180" style="s2">we are isolated atomic individuals in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">our head and our subjectivity is all</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.180" end="00:19:10.950" style="s2">that really matters right and what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">need to do is to get back to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.950" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">that most of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.920" end="00:19:19.720" style="s2">he&#39;s done like the way we networked</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.710" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">minds together the way the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.720" end="00:19:24.370" style="s2">networks commute computers together</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:26.410" style="s2">culture networks minds together so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.370" end="00:19:28.570" style="s2">they can solve these huge Titanic</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.410" end="00:19:30.310" style="s2">problems we&#39;re facing one right now that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.570" end="00:19:33.580" style="s2">we can&#39;t do a damn thing against as</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.310" end="00:19:37.300" style="s2">individuals but we need to get as much</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.580" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">right distributed cognition working</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.300" end="00:19:41.560" style="s2">together and as much of that distributed</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.760" end="00:19:44.440" style="s2">collective intelligence we gotta get it</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.560" end="00:19:46.930" style="s2">operating as rationally and I said as</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.440" end="00:19:50.620" style="s2">wisely as possible and we need to do a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.930" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">lot of work to get that collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.620" end="00:19:55.000" style="s2">intelligence up to collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:56.710" style="s2">that&#39;s the product now it&#39;s doable it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">very doable and the things that have</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.710" end="00:20:00.010" style="s2">done that in the past have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:02.440" style="s2">religions religions have brought about</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.010" end="00:20:05.230" style="s2">that tremendous transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.440" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">consciousness cognition character and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.230" end="00:20:11.050" style="s2">ultimately culture it needs something</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">analogous in this discourse unless I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.050" end="00:20:15.910" style="s2">not proposing a religion but we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">something analogous to religion in order</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.910" end="00:20:19.480" style="s2">in this collective discourse to create</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:22.030" style="s2">an there&#39;s a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.480" end="00:20:24.340" style="s2">cult and culture you can hear it in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.030" end="00:20:29.860" style="s2">word they&#39;re bound together cultists</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.340" end="00:20:35.050" style="s2">right one thing I thought of which I I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.860" end="00:20:40.510" style="s2">guess I haven&#39;t thought of before as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.050" end="00:20:42.760" style="s2">as a way to cultivate a dialectic well</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.510" end="00:20:45.720" style="s2">the big problem I have is with these</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.760" end="00:20:47.860" style="s2">social media platforms like Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:50.110" style="s2">even though you know I really I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.860" end="00:20:52.690" style="s2">totally capable of discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.110" end="00:20:54.430" style="s2">dialectic but you know you started with</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.690" end="00:20:55.900" style="s2">up with a long comment and then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.430" end="00:20:58.600" style="s2">shorter and shorter and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.900" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">divisive you know we&#39;ve even among like</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.600" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">you know two really smart calm relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">intellectual people so I think well one</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:12.490" style="s2">thing we definitely need isn&#39;t is a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:14.950" style="s2">platform and we don&#39;t really have a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.490" end="00:21:18.610" style="s2">platform I was thinking like maybe read</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.950" end="00:21:21.580" style="s2">it maybe forms there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.610" end="00:21:23.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s like but even even if we look</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.580" end="00:21:27.430" style="s2">at all of these like communication</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.920" end="00:21:28.870" style="s2">platforms I still feel like even if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.430" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">find one good one there</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.870" end="00:21:33.730" style="s2">would still be like an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:36.390" style="s2">culture that I guess it has to grow</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.730" end="00:21:39.100" style="s2">organically right and we have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.390" end="00:21:40.780" style="s2">it isn&#39;t all organically that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.100" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">bottom up but it also needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.780" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">informed by our best historical and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.780" style="s2">scientific understanding that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:50.260" style="s2">top-down aspect need to be doing both at</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.780" end="00:21:51.790" style="s2">the same time I think one of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.260" end="00:21:54.820" style="s2">trying to put my finger on earlier is</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.790" end="00:21:57.880" style="s2">one of the things Co bit 19 is showing</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.820" end="00:22:00.309" style="s2">us is it&#39;s putting a gloomy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.880" end="00:22:02.050" style="s2">evolutionary metaphor it&#39;s putting</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.309" end="00:22:04.420" style="s2">selective pressure on us to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.050" end="00:22:06.370" style="s2">the alternative ways in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.420" end="00:22:08.230" style="s2">carry out deep discourse that would</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.370" end="00:22:10.870" style="s2">afford something like dialectic where</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.230" end="00:22:12.820" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out basically how</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.870" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">do we keep a society and a culture</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.820" end="00:22:18.460" style="s2">running through you know these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:22.150" style="s2">communicative platforms I think people</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.460" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">who let&#39;s let&#39;s be really brutally</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.150" end="00:22:26.440" style="s2">honest this isn&#39;t going to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">pandemic we&#39;re gonna be facing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.440" end="00:22:30.340" style="s2">causes of this have not gone away the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">biological you know the permafrost</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.340" end="00:22:36.520" style="s2">melting the rainforests being cut down</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.980" end="00:22:38.440" style="s2">human concentration and massive global</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.520" end="00:22:40.510" style="s2">is like all the none of those factors</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:42.370" style="s2">have gone away alright so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.510" end="00:22:44.740" style="s2">gonna be the only time this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.370" end="00:22:47.920" style="s2">happen to us and so I think the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.740" end="00:22:49.390" style="s2">who this is I guess the people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.920" end="00:22:51.580" style="s2">figure out how to do what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.390" end="00:22:54.520" style="s2">about how to figure out how to get this</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.580" end="00:22:56.650" style="s2">into a more comprehensive collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.520" end="00:23:00.100" style="s2">platform you know where we can carry out</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.650" end="00:23:02.110" style="s2">this kind of dialectic right and we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.100" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">scale it up and down the way we used to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.110" end="00:23:08.110" style="s2">do like with with with with religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.360" end="00:23:09.910" style="s2">that person will be those people will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.110" end="00:23:12.280" style="s2">enormous little wealthy I would think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.910" end="00:23:13.960" style="s2">this is an opportunity if people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.280" end="00:23:16.690" style="s2">looking for a business opportunity a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.960" end="00:23:17.860" style="s2">business opportunity that could hope to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.690" end="00:23:19.870" style="s2">change the course of history in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.860" end="00:23:24.160" style="s2">positive direction this is the place to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.870" end="00:23:25.390" style="s2">go right and you and I are doing that at</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.160" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">this very moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.390" end="00:23:31.630" style="s2">so YouTube that&#39;s the one platform or</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">isn&#39;t thinking of so we&#39;re doing what</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.630" end="00:23:36.220" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it a lot with YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:39.640" style="s2">YouTube is I think really good at it</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.220" end="00:23:42.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m using it a lot as a platform</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.640" end="00:23:45.400" style="s2">the problem with YouTube is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.490" end="00:23:48.300" style="s2">tends to be passive participation for</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.400" end="00:23:50.890" style="s2">the vast majority of people yes right</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.300" end="00:23:52.900" style="s2">and so you need to be able to you need</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.890" end="00:23:54.580" style="s2">to you&#39;re either you&#39;re either in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.900" end="00:23:56.770" style="s2">either you know you&#39;re either the person</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.580" end="00:23:58.450" style="s2">on the YouTube channel or you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.770" end="00:24:00.700" style="s2">passive observer I mean you make</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.450" end="00:24:02.470" style="s2">comments but you know I mean which</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.700" end="00:24:04.420" style="s2">they&#39;re doing a little bit more we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.470" end="00:24:08.670" style="s2">doing premiering which is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.420" end="00:24:11.950" style="s2">idea and people you know chat well um</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.670" end="00:24:13.750" style="s2">something&#39;s on YouTube there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.950" end="00:24:15.910" style="s2">creating watch parties I know the future</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.750" end="00:24:17.740" style="s2">thinker did quite a few of those for my</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.910" end="00:24:19.900" style="s2">awakening for the meaning crisis where</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.740" end="00:24:23.260" style="s2">people watch the videos together and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.900" end="00:24:24.820" style="s2">then of a video a you know group video</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.260" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">chat and talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.820" end="00:24:28.929" style="s2">which i think is an excellent idea I see</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:30.370" style="s2">that I see it evolving but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.929" end="00:24:32.170" style="s2">like this you know what I mean it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.370" end="00:24:34.330" style="s2">over but somebody needs to sort of hey</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.170" end="00:24:36.309" style="s2">here&#39;s how we could but not somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.330" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">you know smoothly it&#39;s gonna be a group</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.309" end="00:24:42.910" style="s2">of people say but here&#39;s how we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:45.780" style="s2">coordinate this all together right kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.910" end="00:24:48.490" style="s2">of reminds me of my music festival days</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.780" end="00:24:48.940" style="s2">you know you&#39;re just in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.490" end="00:24:53.740" style="s2">nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.940" end="00:24:56.020" style="s2">and India is like this also the Hulk</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.740" end="00:24:57.670" style="s2">India is like a music festival that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.020" end="00:25:01.660" style="s2">the best way I describe it is it just</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.670" end="00:25:04.150" style="s2">it&#39;s complete chaos but it you know they</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.660" end="00:25:06.940" style="s2">all they&#39;re peaceful right but then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.150" end="00:25:09.730" style="s2">just the energy just kind of like builds</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.940" end="00:25:12.520" style="s2">up from like the collective minds until</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.730" end="00:25:14.590" style="s2">eventually some leader just emerges and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.520" end="00:25:17.130" style="s2">says okay guys we&#39;re doing this my voice</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.590" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">is louder than you and they go yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.130" end="00:25:26.200" style="s2">let&#39;s do that well I mean so that means</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger to all of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.200" end="00:25:31.030" style="s2">talking about of course because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:33.130" style="s2">an opportunity for people to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:34.830" style="s2">others because of the hunger for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.130" end="00:25:39.970" style="s2">and because of the hunger for home</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.830" end="00:25:43.540" style="s2">cultural home so yeah I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.970" end="00:25:49.809" style="s2">be also very vigilant about that we want</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.540" end="00:25:52.780" style="s2">to pick leaders who have given us good</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.809" end="00:25:54.850" style="s2">evidence and good plausible reason that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.780" end="00:25:55.480" style="s2">they are deeply committed from a place</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.850" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">of Integra</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.480" end="00:26:00.429" style="s2">towards wisdom and meaning that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:03.340" style="s2">we have to that&#39;s what we have to make</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.429" end="00:26:09.100" style="s2">central not that they initially make us</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.340" end="00:26:12.870" style="s2">feel good right right okay so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.100" end="00:26:15.549" style="s2">about religion so one thing is your dad</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.870" end="00:26:17.950" style="s2">many times before is like people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.549" end="00:26:19.899" style="s2">looking for a religion that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.950" end="00:26:22.659" style="s2">religious right the religion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.899" end="00:26:25.899" style="s2">a religion yeah yeah so to me that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.659" end="00:26:27.909" style="s2">sounds like the well it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.899" end="00:26:37.990" style="s2">exactly what I&#39;m doing basically which</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.909" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">is go along it&#39;s God but no church yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.990" end="00:26:43.230" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s what a lot of what the so</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:47.590" style="s2">called nuns NO NES we&#39;re doing right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.230" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t they don&#39;t for largely for we</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.590" end="00:26:50.649" style="s2">haven&#39;t gone into them we keep alluding</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:52.690" style="s2">for them all after you do it again but</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.649" end="00:26:54.159" style="s2">your your listeners can know that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.690" end="00:26:56.440" style="s2">know I do discuss this at length in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.159" end="00:27:02.010" style="s2">series but for a lot of historical</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.440" end="00:27:04.029" style="s2">reasons and and and some current reasons</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.010" end="00:27:07.960" style="s2">many people have sort of turned their</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.029" end="00:27:10.360" style="s2">back on the organized religions various</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.960" end="00:27:13.470" style="s2">kinds this isn&#39;t just you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.360" end="00:27:16.029" style="s2">particular to Christianity for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.470" end="00:27:18.190" style="s2">in a sense that and here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.029" end="00:27:20.590" style="s2">that with the whole new atheism movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.190" end="00:27:22.269" style="s2">missed the New Atheism movement was all</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.590" end="00:27:26.049" style="s2">about well you know what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.269" end="00:27:27.850" style="s2">that people are disbelieving in God or</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.049" end="00:27:29.470" style="s2">the sacred or something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.850" end="00:27:31.240" style="s2">not the case with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.470" end="00:27:34.899" style="s2">put yourself out as an example so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.240" end="00:27:37.029" style="s2">going to use you okay and so no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.899" end="00:27:39.940" style="s2">not the case it&#39;s not that these people</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.029" end="00:27:42.700" style="s2">are atheists it&#39;s that they find and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.940" end="00:27:45.429" style="s2">this is a much more important point they</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.700" end="00:27:48.250" style="s2">find that the traditional frameworks the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.429" end="00:27:51.399" style="s2">traditional religions non-viable they</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.250" end="00:27:53.260" style="s2">don&#39;t connect and if my argument is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.399" end="00:27:56.049" style="s2">right what people are deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.260" end="00:27:58.179" style="s2">looking for when they turn to a religion</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.049" end="00:28:00.279" style="s2">is to enhance that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.179" end="00:28:02.620" style="s2">connectedness and to give them something</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.279" end="00:28:05.529" style="s2">that&#39;s viable and workable in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.620" end="00:28:06.910" style="s2">lives for overcoming self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.529" end="00:28:09.040" style="s2">a forty meeting and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.910" end="00:28:12.190" style="s2">they&#39;re basically saying to the churches</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.040" end="00:28:14.560" style="s2">and the temples and the mosques and etc</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:17.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t do that for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.560" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">anymore and they also reject what we</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.740" end="00:28:21.970" style="s2">tried in the 20th century which was you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:24.580" style="s2">know you know pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.970" end="00:28:27.160" style="s2">ideologies like you know Nazism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.580" end="00:28:29.710" style="s2">communism and think we they reject those</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.160" end="00:28:32.860" style="s2">because they saw the way they drench the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.710" end="00:28:38.050" style="s2">world in blood finally if you allow me</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.860" end="00:28:40.150" style="s2">one more point is that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.050" end="00:28:43.270" style="s2">can&#39;t people try to deny that but you</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.150" end="00:28:45.100" style="s2">can&#39;t deny the importance of Science and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.270" end="00:28:46.840" style="s2">Technology and you can&#39;t separate them</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.100" end="00:28:48.550" style="s2">they&#39;re not identical but science and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.840" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">technology are woven together they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.550" end="00:28:52.090" style="s2">married together I mean that a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:54.460" style="s2">strong sense of the word but that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.090" end="00:28:56.650" style="s2">relying on science and technology for us</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.460" end="00:28:59.890" style="s2">to even have met to even have this</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.650" end="00:29:03.220" style="s2">conversation and if you try to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.890" end="00:29:05.830" style="s2">that that pervasive worldview is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.220" end="00:29:08.560" style="s2">seeped into the guts of your mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.830" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a deep form of self-deception so</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.560" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">you what you need is you need something</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:17.530" style="s2">right that gives people in I&#39;ll use that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.490" end="00:29:20.110" style="s2">term ecology practices that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.530" end="00:29:21.820" style="s2">viable to them that they can somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.110" end="00:29:23.860" style="s2">live with while they live in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.820" end="00:29:26.760" style="s2">scientific hyper technological world</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.860" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">right and gives them a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.760" end="00:29:32.890" style="s2">enhancing their connectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:34.630" style="s2">enhancing their capacity to grow</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.890" end="00:29:37.420" style="s2">overcome self-deception to self</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:38.800" style="s2">transcend so that&#39;s what a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.420" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">how people are doing it to various</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.800" end="00:29:43.300" style="s2">degrees of effectiveness some people do</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:45.610" style="s2">that to escape they go into virtual</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.300" end="00:29:48.250" style="s2">games where they find already set</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.610" end="00:29:50.200" style="s2">narrative and they find a ready set you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.250" end="00:29:51.850" style="s2">know worldview that makes sense and has</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.200" end="00:29:54.490" style="s2">rules and they find it ready set way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.850" end="00:29:56.470" style="s2">self transcending and leveling up some</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.490" end="00:29:58.900" style="s2">people escape other people choose to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.470" end="00:30:00.370" style="s2">stay I think that&#39;s what you referring</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.900" end="00:30:03.580" style="s2">with to and you refer to yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.370" end="00:30:07.870" style="s2">try and somehow make it work but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.580" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">problem for that is again the problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.870" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">with what many people are doing is they</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:15.900" style="s2">as I said before it you can get isolated</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:20.669" style="s2">can be autodidactic it can be fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.900" end="00:30:24.970" style="s2">and and that that&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.669" end="00:30:26.950" style="s2">ultimately frustrates people in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.970" end="00:30:29.049" style="s2">a profound way because part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.950" end="00:30:30.760" style="s2">connectedness you&#39;re looking for is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.049" end="00:30:33.309" style="s2">just a deeper connectedness to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.760" end="00:30:37.630" style="s2">and the world it&#39;s deeper connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.309" end="00:30:43.090" style="s2">to other people and that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.630" end="00:30:44.140" style="s2">hard to do and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.090" end="00:30:49.240" style="s2">talking about when I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.140" end="00:30:52.360" style="s2">religion it&#39;s not a religion okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:55.899" style="s2">religion is is like the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.360" end="00:30:58.899" style="s2">thing that like it&#39;s it&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.899" end="00:30:59.740" style="s2">and the solution it seems yes that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.899" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">very well said</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.740" end="00:31:03.880" style="s2">that&#39;s we&#39;re saying again it is both</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:05.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to capture with</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.880" end="00:31:07.720" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.590" end="00:31:09.909" style="s2">insofar as it&#39;s a solution we need what</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.720" end="00:31:11.470" style="s2">we&#39;re talking to be a religion but</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.909" end="00:31:13.240" style="s2">insofar as traditional religion is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.470" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">problem when you get to not be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.240" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">religion that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:19.570" style="s2">to convey with that phrase but you put</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:23.470" style="s2">it nicely it&#39;s both the solution and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.570" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">problem so maybe do you mind if I share</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.470" end="00:31:31.169" style="s2">some personal experience please</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:38.919" style="s2">so I&#39;m unbelievably fortunate in my life</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.169" end="00:31:42.789" style="s2">but speaking just on religion I was 24</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.919" end="00:31:44.850" style="s2">25 and I wandered into my apartment and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.789" end="00:31:48.370" style="s2">I saw a copy of the Bhagavad Gita on</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.850" end="00:31:50.500" style="s2">like my countertop there never heard of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.370" end="00:31:52.570" style="s2">it before which is strange right because</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.500" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">I didn&#39;t like it I used to be a hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.570" end="00:32:00.279" style="s2">intellectual now I&#39;m more into just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:02.649" style="s2">just not like nerdy about it I guess no</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.279" end="00:32:07.140" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a habit so I can&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.649" end="00:32:09.549" style="s2">kick it but um and I don&#39;t want to but</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.140" end="00:32:11.830" style="s2">so anyway I picked it up and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.549" end="00:32:15.480" style="s2">whoa this is so cool and I read the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.830" end="00:32:18.610" style="s2">whole damn thing every verse and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.480" end="00:32:23.860" style="s2">literally a month or two a couple months</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.610" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">later I actually met Krishna like inside</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.860" end="00:32:31.299" style="s2">myself and in your antistick experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:33.640" style="s2">a very profound mystical experience and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.299" end="00:32:34.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m in China now because</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.640" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">shortly after that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.630" end="00:32:39.850" style="s2">I lost all my friends they all thought I</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:43.690" style="s2">was crazy and I found myself in Thailand</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.850" end="00:32:45.640" style="s2">teaching English on a whim you know but</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.690" end="00:32:51.669" style="s2">but here&#39;s here&#39;s where it gets really</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.640" end="00:32:55.450" style="s2">interesting so I I can&#39;t believe how</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.669" end="00:32:58.510" style="s2">this happened so I read the Gita and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.450" end="00:33:01.059" style="s2">I like I understood it all and and I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.510" end="00:33:05.559" style="s2">able to like incorporate the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.059" end="00:33:08.409" style="s2">without ever meeting another devotee a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.559" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2">church a temple anything but it but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.409" end="00:33:15.100" style="s2">still like it it can&#39;t last forever so a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">couple years ago I said I had to go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.100" end="00:33:20.919" style="s2">India and I got to go to like the home</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:27.549" style="s2">birthplace of this and that&#39;s what I did</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.919" end="00:33:35.530" style="s2">and some pretty bad experiences there so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.549" end="00:33:38.020" style="s2">I yeah like um I I so I went to take a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.530" end="00:33:41.010" style="s2">beginner disciple course this is like</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.020" end="00:33:44.590" style="s2">the most level 0 level one I could find</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.010" end="00:33:47.289" style="s2">which was a total cost of five dollars</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.590" end="00:33:49.929" style="s2">for a three day course I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.289" end="00:33:54.690" style="s2">it is in rupees but you know very cheap</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.929" end="00:33:58.299" style="s2">level one course they rejected me and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.690" end="00:34:01.570" style="s2">and I mean as soon as that happened I</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.299" end="00:34:03.700" style="s2">was like I was so in shock I was so</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.570" end="00:34:05.470" style="s2">humbled which is actually a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.700" end="00:34:07.299" style="s2">like humility is like very good</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.470" end="00:34:09.639" style="s2">spiritual virtue right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.299" end="00:34:12.330" style="s2">ultimately it&#39;s ultimately helped me a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.639" end="00:34:18.780" style="s2">lot but I&#39;ve learned to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.330" end="00:34:22.899" style="s2">like do Krishna do God unlike my own</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.780" end="00:34:26.500" style="s2">like like I&#39;m still like I have friends</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.899" end="00:34:29.320" style="s2">who are you know practicing as I am but</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.500" end="00:34:31.720" style="s2">I&#39;m not just going to like give a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.320" end="00:34:36.580" style="s2">thousand dollars to the church to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.720" end="00:34:40.109" style="s2">know like yeah and and also just final</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.580" end="00:34:43.990" style="s2">in closing so I&#39;ve always been against</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.109" end="00:34:45.730" style="s2">dogma in general and organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.990" end="00:34:47.530" style="s2">in all institutions I&#39;ve never had an</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.730" end="00:34:48.429" style="s2">attraction here but what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.530" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.429" end="00:34:54.190" style="s2">to me as I&#39;m I&#39;m now even more against</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:57.190" style="s2">it I think they melt then a lot of nuns</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.190" end="00:35:01.000" style="s2">and but I&#39;m actually very religious I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.190" end="00:35:04.359" style="s2">practice I shan&#39;t almost 2,000 mantras</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:06.819" style="s2">every day right that&#39;s that&#39;s more that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.359" end="00:35:08.619" style="s2">that&#39;s a couple hours it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.819" end="00:35:11.380" style="s2">thing in my life that I that I do</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.619" end="00:35:13.030" style="s2">strictly everything else I might change</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.380" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">a little bit you know I changed the time</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.030" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2">I brush my teeth and different things</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">but every single day this is one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:27.250" style="s2">do and ya can&#39;t respond to that because</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.660" style="s2">I think part of the tell you what the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.250" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion is again</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.660" end="00:35:34.300" style="s2">not to is not to try and create a single</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:37.390" style="s2">thing it what what I what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.300" end="00:35:43.180" style="s2">talk about is a culture maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.390" end="00:35:47.170" style="s2">where there you as you know as a devotee</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.180" end="00:35:51.220" style="s2">a the whole you know wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.170" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">surrounding Krishna right Hindu usually</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.220" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">using a version of the dantana right</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.410" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">yeah yeah that you can enter into deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:04.150" style="s2">communion communication and community</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:06.190" style="s2">people perhaps coming from a stoic</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:32.859" style="s2">because the process itself is before us</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.740" end="00:37:35.079" style="s2">and after us and it&#39;s self-corrects and</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:42.280" style="s2">right now is we&#39;re losing that ability</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.569" end="00:38:26.829" style="s2">epicurean and they all got along</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.549" end="00:38:29.970" style="s2">together they were all mutually</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.829" end="00:38:33.670" style="s2">supported by the Roman Empire right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.970" end="00:38:35.770" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the kind of thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.670" end="00:38:37.510" style="s2">trying to talk about because I I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.770" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">we need only need an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.510" end="00:38:41.829" style="s2">practices we need an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.390" style="s2">communities and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.829" end="00:38:45.670" style="s2">I&#39;m grateful for is growing up in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.390" end="00:38:47.290" style="s2">where we have before hey very good</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.670" end="00:38:50.470" style="s2">historical reasons we have a long</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.290" end="00:38:53.010" style="s2">tradition and I people II believe in you</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.470" end="00:38:56.530" style="s2">know of multiculturalism as an idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.010" end="00:38:58.059" style="s2">where you can have two communities</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.530" end="00:39:01.750" style="s2">living together because of a shared</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.059" end="00:39:05.670" style="s2">commitment to processes of communication</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.750" end="00:39:05.670" style="s2">communing and collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.680" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">can I share another experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.820" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">so I guess maybe the first big mystical</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.330" end="00:39:26.020" style="s2">experience I had was reading Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:29.950" style="s2">next room yeah I was 16 and which</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.020" end="00:39:33.400" style="s2">treatise the ethics Nicomachean ethics</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.950" end="00:39:35.800" style="s2">yeah of course I was also really lucky I</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.400" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">got the best translation because you</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.800" end="00:39:41.740" style="s2">know these with all these ancient texts</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">the translation is so fundamental it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.740" end="00:39:48.490" style="s2">so important years years later I tried</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">reading a different translation I</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.490" end="00:39:53.290" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get through the first page I</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:55.660" style="s2">was like this sucks you know but I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.290" end="00:39:58.840" style="s2">good no totally the translation really</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.660" end="00:40:01.150" style="s2">matters yeah I had a similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.840" end="00:40:05.050" style="s2">when I read the Republic by Plato for</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.150" end="00:40:07.240" style="s2">the first time excellent well this this</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.050" end="00:40:11.110" style="s2">experience I had was was really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.240" end="00:40:14.830" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like meeting God but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.110" end="00:40:19.810" style="s2">not as like so what I think happened was</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.830" end="00:40:21.730" style="s2">I met my own past life so like it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.810" end="00:40:23.710" style="s2">literally like the first sentence or</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.730" end="00:40:27.400" style="s2">within the first paragraph on the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.710" end="00:40:31.930" style="s2">page my inner voice that was saying the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.400" end="00:40:34.750" style="s2">words was no longer my voice yes people</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.930" end="00:40:37.150" style="s2">have had this experience yeah oh cool</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.750" end="00:40:40.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a meditative practice in fact where</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.150" end="00:40:42.040" style="s2">people learn to listen to the voice of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.690" end="00:40:50.950" style="s2">their thoughts and they often discover</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.040" end="00:40:55.000" style="s2">that that voice isn&#39;t their voice yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.950" end="00:40:56.770" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s one way in which you apply</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.000" end="00:40:58.780" style="s2">the five factors of inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.770" end="00:41:01.060" style="s2">mindfulness to distractions especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.780" end="00:41:02.410" style="s2">when the distractions are thinking so</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.060" end="00:41:04.570" style="s2">one of the ways you want it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.410" end="00:41:06.610" style="s2">be able to step back and be able to look</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.570" end="00:41:07.480" style="s2">at the process which is what goes back</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.610" end="00:41:08.050" style="s2">to what we&#39;re talking about a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.480" end="00:41:09.550" style="s2">minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.050" end="00:41:11.230" style="s2">rather than getting involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.550" end="00:41:13.180" style="s2">content of your thoughts that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.230" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">hard for people to do one way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.180" end="00:41:18.280" style="s2">is to focus not on what&#39;s being said but</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:20.710" style="s2">on the voice of your inner speech as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.280" end="00:41:26.589" style="s2">way of right still</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.710" end="00:41:29.170" style="s2">being aware and that of itself as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.589" end="00:41:30.730" style="s2">practice is valuable but it also it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.170" end="00:41:32.829" style="s2">often be a revelation to people because</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.730" end="00:41:34.660" style="s2">though I remember I taught one student</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.829" end="00:41:36.760" style="s2">and he had been sort of I could tell he</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.660" end="00:41:39.010" style="s2">was he was sticking with the course I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.760" end="00:41:40.750" style="s2">was teaching you were diligent but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.010" end="00:41:43.059" style="s2">could tell his enthusiasm was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.750" end="00:41:44.290" style="s2">middling and then I taught him this and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.059" end="00:41:45.700" style="s2">he sort of wet and then he came back the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.290" end="00:41:47.619" style="s2">next week and he was totally changed</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.700" end="00:41:50.380" style="s2">that was him like I now see why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.619" end="00:41:52.300" style="s2">doing this he said because I realized</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.380" end="00:41:54.750" style="s2">for the first time that the voice inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.300" end="00:41:58.119" style="s2">my head was my father&#39;s rather than mine</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.750" end="00:42:02.410" style="s2">and he had this profound sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.119" end="00:42:06.069" style="s2">realization of aspects and dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.410" end="00:42:08.140" style="s2">the mind that he that he his ego</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.069" end="00:42:12.430" style="s2">framework had not been you know directly</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.140" end="00:42:14.950" style="s2">aware of and how that was manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.430" end="00:42:17.260" style="s2">his behavior causing him to fall into</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.950" end="00:42:20.260" style="s2">self-deception in ways of course that he</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.260" end="00:42:23.319" style="s2">was not aware of and so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.260" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">profound thing and of course you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.319" end="00:42:26.530" style="s2">have it to varying degrees in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.790" end="00:42:28.740" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition people often</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.530" end="00:42:32.200" style="s2">talked about anamnesis this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.740" end="00:42:33.309" style="s2">remembering your true you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.200" end="00:42:36.010" style="s2">want to see your true self because that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.309" end="00:42:38.410" style="s2">sounds very romantic in a way I critical</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.010" end="00:42:40.690" style="s2">but remembering right the depths</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.410" end="00:42:50.530" style="s2">recovering we collecting the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.690" end="00:42:52.809" style="s2">the psyche or just like two or three</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.530" end="00:42:56.559" style="s2">really good thoughts at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.809" end="00:42:57.910" style="s2">and I got all jumbled Alex what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.559" end="00:42:59.740" style="s2">doing right now is exactly what I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.910" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">trying to point to a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.740" end="00:43:03.220" style="s2">all right I&#39;m not trying to convert you</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.220" end="00:43:08.020" style="s2">that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening yeah yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.309" end="00:43:10.329" style="s2">if we give up trying to convert and get</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.020" end="00:43:13.960" style="s2">back to conversing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.329" end="00:43:16.690" style="s2">converting I think we can make a</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.960" end="00:43:18.280" style="s2">tremendous amount because what we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.690" end="00:43:20.349" style="s2">share is we can share processes of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.280" end="00:43:22.540" style="s2">insight we can choose processes of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.349" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">transformation we can share processes of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.540" end="00:43:27.940" style="s2">connection okay so I&#39;ve got one thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:30.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve never heard this before maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.940" end="00:43:32.680" style="s2">the first guy doing this but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.700" end="00:43:34.690" style="s2">fundamental shift that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.680" end="00:43:38.619" style="s2">seeing that&#39;s really beneficial in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.690" end="00:43:43.240" style="s2">own life is changing God from a noun to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.619" end="00:43:46.030" style="s2">a verb yes yes yes so that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.240" end="00:43:47.349" style="s2">very much a way in which I&#39;ve heard that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.030" end="00:43:50.559" style="s2">are often expressed in the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.349" end="00:43:53.980" style="s2">mystical tradition of Kabbalah because a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.559" end="00:43:58.829" style="s2">God&#39;s name is actually more properly</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.980" end="00:43:58.829" style="s2">thought of as a verb than as a noun</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.349" end="00:44:04.680" style="s2">another thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.010" end="00:44:11.230" style="s2">so if only wouldn&#39;t I think like see</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.190" end="00:44:14.380" style="s2">what see what I mean though see how if</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.230" end="00:44:16.869" style="s2">you shift from God as a noun to God as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.380" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">verb it Orient&#39;s you towards process and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.869" end="00:44:20.920" style="s2">it starts to orient you towards practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:24.010" style="s2">and it starts to reconfigure your</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.920" end="00:44:26.140" style="s2">worldview so that you can rehome the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.010" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">practices that you&#39;re finding personally</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.140" end="00:44:31.750" style="s2">transformative in your own life right</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:34.359" style="s2">right so so if we have God as a noun</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.750" end="00:44:37.299" style="s2">like say Krishna and Krishna says oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.359" end="00:44:39.640" style="s2">look at me here&#39;s my peacock feather you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.299" end="00:44:41.829" style="s2">know I like cow so you have to be good</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.640" end="00:44:44.890" style="s2">to the cows that&#39;s where people get lost</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.829" end="00:44:47.970" style="s2">is they focus on the too much on that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.890" end="00:44:55.000" style="s2">you know all that baggage from the now</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.970" end="00:44:58.780" style="s2">right yes so another this I guess is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.000" end="00:45:00.069" style="s2">fully relevant to like Oh a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.780" end="00:45:02.410" style="s2">culture I&#39;m thinking more about</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.069" end="00:45:05.500" style="s2">individuals what I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.410" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">Westerners are missing is a Bible and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.500" end="00:45:12.180" style="s2">don&#39;t mean the Bible I mean Bible</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:16.180" style="s2">something that to me a Bible is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.180" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the rock bottom and in the ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.180" end="00:45:22.809" style="s2">at the stand the ceiling at the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:26.020" style="s2">time so it&#39;s like you it could be a text</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.809" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">it could be a doctrine I mean I&#39;m I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.020" end="00:45:34.059" style="s2">a very loose definition of this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:36.280" style="s2">like it keeps you like safe and at home</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.059" end="00:45:38.410" style="s2">like you always know where you are but</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.280" end="00:45:40.930" style="s2">at the same time you cannot transcend</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.410" end="00:45:45.190" style="s2">your Bible because then it&#39;s not a Bible</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.930" end="00:45:46.550" style="s2">right but but also if you sink down all</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.190" end="00:45:49.849" style="s2">the way into the depths</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.550" end="00:45:52.490" style="s2">the Bible can still your Bible can still</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.849" end="00:45:53.330" style="s2">bring you back up all the way up to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.490" end="00:45:56.869" style="s2">top awesome</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.330" end="00:45:59.740" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s well said so this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.869" end="00:46:02.300" style="s2">especially work that I&#39;ve done with</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.740" end="00:46:10.310" style="s2">Christopher Master Pietro about trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.300" end="00:46:15.109" style="s2">to reinstate witness and what what a sit</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.310" end="00:46:18.109" style="s2">makes something a sacred text part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.109" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">what I&#39;ve tried to understand that is is</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.109" end="00:46:24.700" style="s2">instead of trying to understand it as as</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:27.290" style="s2">the unquestioned set of doctrines</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.700" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">instead you understand it as a text that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.290" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">you can continually go back to and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.119" end="00:46:35.050" style="s2">text grows as you grow yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:40.790" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.050" end="00:46:43.880" style="s2">right and so and then we could also make</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:48.339" style="s2">that even more dynamic in that we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.880" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">try and create something like an online</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.339" end="00:46:55.000" style="s2">compendium of texts that many people</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:58.220" style="s2">have found have this sacredness to them</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.000" end="00:47:00.859" style="s2">more like because actually the Bible the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.220" end="00:47:03.170" style="s2">Bible is not a book it&#39;s a book of books</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.859" end="00:47:05.690" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason why we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.170" end="00:47:08.930" style="s2">a book of books that we&#39;re collectively</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.690" end="00:47:11.330" style="s2">writing and rewriting and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.930" end="00:47:14.180" style="s2">what Wikipedia does you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.330" end="00:47:17.180" style="s2">which constantly doing that so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.180" end="00:47:19.339" style="s2">people as you say have a home a place</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.180" end="00:47:21.320" style="s2">that they can but it should do it should</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.339" end="00:47:23.450" style="s2">do both right I let&#39;s say it&#39;s you both</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.320" end="00:47:25.580" style="s2">home them and it should also call them</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.450" end="00:47:26.900" style="s2">from home it should give them a place</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.580" end="00:47:29.450" style="s2">that they can return to when they need</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.900" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">to heal right and when they were they</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.450" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">need to feel connected and belonging but</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:36.109" style="s2">it should also challenge them to go</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:37.730" style="s2">beyond right to grow because if they</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.109" end="00:47:40.609" style="s2">stop growing then they&#39;ll actually lose</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.730" end="00:47:43.460" style="s2">that if we if we reformulate sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.609" end="00:47:45.230" style="s2">as the text grows as you grow if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.460" end="00:47:47.359" style="s2">stop growing and then you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.230" end="00:47:48.619" style="s2">gonna lose sacredness because the text</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.359" end="00:47:54.349" style="s2">is then going to just become a dead</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.619" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">write that sort of print yes dead set of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.349" end="00:47:59.650" style="s2">propositions is bad may be a way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:01.390" style="s2">saying so I I&#39;m kind of hoping we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.650" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">you because we already have and I do</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.390" end="00:48:05.770" style="s2">this in some of my courses we all you</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:10.330" style="s2">already have this way of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.770" end="00:48:12.370" style="s2">collective intelligence to create a text</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.330" end="00:48:15.250" style="s2">that no one person is the author of and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.370" end="00:48:19.780" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly dynamically shifting and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.250" end="00:48:21.730" style="s2">evolving we can do that we&#39;ve all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.780" end="00:48:24.310" style="s2">already doing it in other domains for</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.730" end="00:48:27.100" style="s2">practical educational purposes we could</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.310" end="00:48:29.290" style="s2">improve upon it and develop it so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.100" end="00:48:32.230" style="s2">edge what we&#39;re trying to educate now is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.290" end="00:48:35.350" style="s2">not a particular course or a particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.230" end="00:48:36.190" style="s2">topic but educate the kind of education</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.350" end="00:48:39.640" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.190" end="00:48:41.530" style="s2">about people right becoming persons</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.640" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">within a community of persons people</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.530" end="00:48:51.580" style="s2">belonging to a tradition of wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:54.250" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing is since since I have my</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.580" end="00:48:57.640" style="s2">own two Bibles Aristotle&#39;s ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.250" end="00:48:59.140" style="s2">the bhagavad-gita which are yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.640" end="00:49:01.420" style="s2">know they&#39;re they&#39;re not from the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.140" end="00:49:04.680" style="s2">continent of course or the same culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.420" end="00:49:07.720" style="s2">but for some reason it just they both</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.680" end="00:49:10.960" style="s2">are perfect for me and they go together</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.720" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">at the same time and because I have just</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:20.290" style="s2">these two texts which are not that long</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.570" end="00:49:23.650" style="s2">to to to fully envelop my whole identity</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.290" end="00:49:25.090" style="s2">my whole life I can put anything that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.650" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">comes into my consciousness my</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.090" end="00:49:30.580" style="s2">relationships with I just I fit it into</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:32.680" style="s2">the into the jigsaw of these two Bibles</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.580" end="00:49:35.860" style="s2">and I know exactly where I am</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.680" end="00:49:38.560" style="s2">so what I&#39;m doing that that&#39;s why my</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.860" end="00:49:40.840" style="s2">name is ethos Ananda so ethos stands for</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.560" end="00:49:45.880" style="s2">Aristotle basically in the West and all</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.840" end="00:49:49.020" style="s2">that stuff and Ananda is bliss and yoga</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.880" end="00:49:52.420" style="s2">and all that Eastern stuff right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.020" end="00:49:53.670" style="s2">sorry I&#39;ve been miss refer I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.420" end="00:49:57.910" style="s2">missed naming you throughout our</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.670" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">conversation well I have many names alex</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.910" end="00:50:03.550" style="s2">is behind ethos is like my brand name</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:07.180" style="s2">you know I just you know like you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.550" end="00:50:09.480" style="s2">call me ethos that&#39;s fine my devotee</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.180" end="00:50:13.110" style="s2">friends they call me ananda actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.480" end="00:50:13.110" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.230" end="00:50:19.240" style="s2">yeah so what I did was and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.140" end="00:50:22.660" style="s2">a terrible marketer so I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.240" end="00:50:26.680" style="s2">to really push this out but I I</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.660" end="00:50:31.750" style="s2">basically converted Aristotle&#39;s ethics</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.680" end="00:50:33.970" style="s2">into an actual Bible so instace you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.750" end="00:50:37.270" style="s2">Aristotle writes and it&#39;s very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.970" end="00:50:39.160" style="s2">like I guess dialectic or dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.270" end="00:50:41.260" style="s2">fashion where it&#39;s kind of like and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.160" end="00:50:44.440" style="s2">let&#39;s think about this and Plato said</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.260" end="00:50:47.110" style="s2">this and this and that so I took all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.440" end="00:50:49.180" style="s2">important points and I and I numbered</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.110" end="00:50:52.260" style="s2">them so it&#39;s just like reading a Bible</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.180" end="00:50:56.200" style="s2">or it&#39;s like verse 1 verse 2 verse 3 I</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.260" end="00:50:59.740" style="s2">got it down to four hundred verses so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.200" end="00:51:02.920" style="s2">think for for those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.740" end="00:51:06.340" style="s2">looking for something like that which I</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.920" end="00:51:08.110" style="s2">was it seems like I was and I still am</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.340" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">my whole life it&#39;s just like Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.110" end="00:51:14.530" style="s2">I&#39;m like hungry for this stuff wisdom I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:16.510" style="s2">guess like I&#39;m so hungry for and I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.530" end="00:51:19.030" style="s2">just lucky you know it just came into my</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.510" end="00:51:22.210" style="s2">life but I&#39;m sure there are people out</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.030" end="00:51:24.490" style="s2">there you know they&#39;re looking for it I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.210" end="00:51:26.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to get this to them but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.490" end="00:51:28.600" style="s2">just it came to this day where I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.860" end="00:51:32.080" style="s2">like I got to write this out and I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.600" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">just like do this you know part of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.080" end="00:51:38.530" style="s2">carnal millions it&#39;s really great I</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.790" style="s2">think there&#39;s lots of people who would</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.530" end="00:51:41.860" style="s2">benefit from that and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.790" end="00:51:45.160" style="s2">lots of people who want to be doing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.860" end="00:51:46.780" style="s2">I mean again that&#39;s what what we see</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.160" end="00:51:48.910" style="s2">happening on these collective forums</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.780" end="00:51:50.680" style="s2">where people try to create a collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.910" end="00:51:55.300" style="s2">document rather than an individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.680" end="00:51:58.840" style="s2">document all right and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.300" end="00:52:04.300" style="s2">really um another excellent thing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.840" end="00:52:06.280" style="s2">having a master so a Bible Bible is so</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.300" end="00:52:08.110" style="s2">cool because it you can look up to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.280" end="00:52:13.090" style="s2">like it&#39;s your master but you also can</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.110" end="00:52:16.060" style="s2">stand on it but you having like so</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.090" end="00:52:18.760" style="s2">Aristotle is actually my master like in</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.060" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">in life I talked about this you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.760" end="00:52:23.590" style="s2">have a sage that you learned intimately</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:25.320" style="s2">I just learn about you have to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.590" end="00:52:26.610" style="s2">to intimate image</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.320" end="00:52:29.160" style="s2">internalizing you have to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.610" end="00:52:30.270" style="s2">internalize a sage sounds like you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.160" end="00:52:31.470" style="s2">and this is what something I also</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.270" end="00:52:34.440" style="s2">recommend sounds like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.470" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">internalized two sages and that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.440" end="00:52:38.850" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing that goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.740" style="s2">what I was talking about before but an</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.850" end="00:52:42.750" style="s2">ecology of practices and an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.740" end="00:52:46.470" style="s2">communities yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.750" end="00:52:50.600" style="s2">very much it&#39;s very important to find a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.470" end="00:52:53.600" style="s2">sage that you can learn about intimately</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.600" end="00:52:56.970" style="s2">so that you can imitate and internalize</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.600" end="00:52:59.940" style="s2">them in a profound way yes that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.970" end="00:53:02.130" style="s2">important to transforming not just your</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.940" end="00:53:05.100" style="s2">beliefs or transforming your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.130" end="00:53:11.430" style="s2">envision the world and to transcend</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.100" end="00:53:15.150" style="s2">yourself okay okay so like I said before</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.430" end="00:53:17.240" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m mostly just lucky so I I&#39;m I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.150" end="00:53:21.390" style="s2">have a hard time actually figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.240" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">how I got here but what would you say is</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.390" end="00:53:27.150" style="s2">the difference between like oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:29.190" style="s2">studying contem studying Locke and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.150" end="00:53:33.180" style="s2">Hobbes and they&#39;re pretty cool versus</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.190" end="00:53:36.060" style="s2">this guy is my master like how can we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.180" end="00:53:41.550" style="s2">you know help people you know find that</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.060" end="00:53:44.670" style="s2">difference I think that the sage is</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.550" end="00:53:49.560" style="s2">somebody who is sacred in the way we</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.670" end="00:53:51.930" style="s2">talked about that as you as you grow</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.560" end="00:53:56.790" style="s2">they grow for you and that happens with</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.930" end="00:54:00.020" style="s2">typically not the growth that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.790" end="00:54:02.420" style="s2">creating is not just a growth of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.020" end="00:54:05.130" style="s2">theoretical ability or even</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.420" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">philosophical understanding but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.130" end="00:54:10.320" style="s2">kind of growth that is the comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:12.660" style="s2">transformation of a human being as they</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.320" end="00:54:15.330" style="s2">aspire to be someone they are not as</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.660" end="00:54:17.250" style="s2">they aspire to be wiser than they than</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.330" end="00:54:19.080" style="s2">they currently are and that&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.250" end="00:54:22.050" style="s2">sages I say just somebody who reaches</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.080" end="00:54:23.730" style="s2">you now is can reach into you but is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.050" end="00:54:28.850" style="s2">also reaching from where you will</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.730" end="00:54:31.850" style="s2">eventually be that&#39;s very important yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.850" end="00:54:31.850" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.830" end="00:54:41.960" style="s2">so the language here is really important</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.230" end="00:54:44.660" style="s2">I think there&#39;s no it always does we</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.960" end="00:54:48.410" style="s2">have just really important taking great</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.660" end="00:54:50.030" style="s2">care is why I&#39;d so admire he&#39;s a dear</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.410" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">friend of mine my co-author and dear</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.030" end="00:54:53.990" style="s2">friend Christopher master Pietro you</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:56.360" style="s2">care to see any of the time dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.990" end="00:54:58.340" style="s2">that I have with him or anything I logs</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.360" end="00:54:59.570" style="s2">he has with guy or with Andrew Sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.340" end="00:55:05.810" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.570" end="00:55:09.140" style="s2">he&#39;s his eloquence and precision it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.810" end="00:55:12.020" style="s2">lyrical without being anyway merely</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.140" end="00:55:15.710" style="s2">ornamental that is really really</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.020" end="00:55:18.650" style="s2">conducive really really conducive to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.710" end="00:55:21.230" style="s2">kind of profound clarity of realization</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.650" end="00:55:23.090" style="s2">that you don&#39;t get if you just care</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.230" end="00:55:25.640" style="s2">about the product and the bottom line of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.090" end="00:55:28.490" style="s2">your languages if all you&#39;re after is</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.640" end="00:55:32.570" style="s2">again I want you to hear this point not</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.490" end="00:55:35.360" style="s2">let&#39;s go through a process together then</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.570" end="00:55:35.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t take care with language but</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.360" end="00:55:37.910" style="s2">you know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.960" end="00:55:39.500" style="s2">if I take language from you you lose</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.910" end="00:55:41.090" style="s2">most of your humanity this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.500" end="00:55:45.350" style="s2">Buddhist principle and a platonic</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.090" end="00:55:48.920" style="s2">principle you don&#39;t take care very very</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.350" end="00:55:51.290" style="s2">like mindful care of your language your</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.920" end="00:55:55.310" style="s2">ultimately not taking care of your</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.290" end="00:55:57.260" style="s2">humanity this is one thing your your</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.310" end="00:56:02.020" style="s2">colleague Jordan Peterson did a good job</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.260" end="00:56:04.790" style="s2">I think bringing into the the culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.020" end="00:56:07.370" style="s2">it&#39;s so weird like I always knew that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.790" end="00:56:10.070" style="s2">but I saw him and like how he was like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.370" end="00:56:12.430" style="s2">really taken care of how he was speaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.070" end="00:56:16.460" style="s2">and I just found myself doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.430" end="00:56:18.920" style="s2">laughing and now I&#39;m like I would I</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.460" end="00:56:23.030" style="s2">would almost rather died and just then</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.920" end="00:56:25.610" style="s2">to just find myself catching out stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.030" end="00:56:27.530" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in saying stuff that life</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.610" end="00:56:29.420" style="s2">is not worth living as Socrates famously</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.530" end="00:56:31.970" style="s2">said you just said it there you&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.420" end="00:56:33.710" style="s2">die than live the unexamined life I</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.970" end="00:56:35.450" style="s2">agree with you and coming to a place</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.710" end="00:56:38.900" style="s2">where you can honestly say that for</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.450" end="00:56:42.170" style="s2">yourself I think I mean I Socrates as my</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.900" end="00:56:43.770" style="s2">sage right I think that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.170" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">crucial moments on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.770" end="00:56:48.380" style="s2">the wisdom the unexamined life is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:52.560" style="s2">worth living</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.380" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">yes that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a bit higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.560" end="00:56:57.990" style="s2">than a white belt that&#39;s like a green</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:59.850" style="s2">belt level maybe yeah I wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.990" end="00:57:01.470" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.850" end="00:57:05.220" style="s2">realization that sets you on the path</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.470" end="00:57:06.630" style="s2">yeah I didn&#39;t know I didn&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.220" end="00:57:08.850" style="s2">were saying that but I was just you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.630" end="00:57:10.500" style="s2">China yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.850" end="00:57:13.740" style="s2">all right but I think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.500" end="00:57:16.740" style="s2">that tells you that you&#39;ve found your</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.740" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">path if you if the path that you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.740" end="00:57:22.290" style="s2">your foot upon as you honestly on</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:26.610" style="s2">authentically come to a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.290" end="00:57:28.410" style="s2">from the guts up not just here but from</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.610" end="00:57:30.630" style="s2">the guts up you can say as you did so</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.410" end="00:57:32.070" style="s2">spontaneously unauthentic Li you</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.630" end="00:57:32.820" style="s2">basically said the unexamined life is</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.070" end="00:57:36.630" style="s2">not worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.820" end="00:57:38.940" style="s2">I&#39;d rather die did not take care of how</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.630" end="00:57:39.500" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking and how I&#39;m making sense of</p>

<p begin="00:57:39.500" end="00:57:44.580" style="s2">that&#39;s it back to the me for example of</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.750" end="00:58:00.950" style="s2">mmm mystical experiences are important</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.450" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">and you know from my work I talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.950" end="00:58:05.030" style="s2">about them in transformative a all</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:06.770" style="s2">that&#39;s important and you know and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.030" end="00:58:08.570" style="s2">not again you know that I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.770" end="00:58:11.150" style="s2">to be dismissive of everything else you</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.570" end="00:58:14.690" style="s2">said I know I know yeah yeah but that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:17.600" style="s2">that for me it&#39;s it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.690" end="00:58:21.080" style="s2">because like because because a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.600" end="00:58:23.690" style="s2">experience you know you can just have it</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.080" end="00:58:26.200" style="s2">and forget about it but when you when</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.690" end="00:58:28.850" style="s2">you can integrate it to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.200" end="00:58:30.740" style="s2">yes eventually hopefully you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.850" end="00:58:32.570" style="s2">spontaneously authentically say</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.740" end="00:58:36.380" style="s2">something as I did that&#39;s a much better</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.570" end="00:58:43.700" style="s2">sign whereas just saying your took some</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.380" end="00:58:45.770" style="s2">mushrooms man it was dope like yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.700" end="00:58:48.890" style="s2">thing you talked about with Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.770" end="00:58:51.560" style="s2">and others is psycho technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.890" end="00:58:52.130" style="s2">meta psycho technologies yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.560" end="00:58:56.510" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.130" end="00:58:59.420" style="s2">so to me I like this language oh and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.510" end="00:59:01.550" style="s2">another thing about the language what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.420" end="00:59:04.430" style="s2">really need and you you already</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.550" end="00:59:09.620" style="s2">described this perfectly thing what like</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.430" end="00:59:12.740" style="s2">sacred like like we need like like you</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.620" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">you did it so beautifully but if we get</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.740" end="00:59:18.740" style="s2">it in one word so we could yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:22.040" style="s2">then then we can really make progress</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.740" end="00:59:23.660" style="s2">very fast across the board you know for</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.040" end="00:59:26.510" style="s2">religious people for non-religious</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.660" end="00:59:29.060" style="s2">people I think it&#39;ll just like be a nice</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.510" end="00:59:32.840" style="s2">rocker I&#39;ve tried to do it with two</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.060" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">words so that&#39;s the best like I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.840" end="00:59:38.180" style="s2">capture with the sense of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:39.860" style="s2">opening something is opening up the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.180" end="00:59:46.550" style="s2">world and opening up you in a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.860" end="00:59:50.030" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s it grows as you grow the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.550" end="00:59:52.760" style="s2">world you start just you start to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.030" end="00:59:55.310" style="s2">like a lens right right said it the eye</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.760" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">by which I see God is the same eye by</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.310" end="01:00:00.740" style="s2">which God sees me right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:02.870" style="s2">sacred is reciprocally opening it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.740" end="01:00:05.780" style="s2">taking me into the depths of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.870" end="01:00:09.290" style="s2">ultimate in reality and it&#39;s taking me</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.780" end="01:00:10.580" style="s2">it right into the depths of what&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.290" end="01:00:12.830" style="s2">grounding</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.580" end="01:00:17.720" style="s2">my entire psyche and its reciprocally</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.830" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">opening me up that&#39;s how I try to get it</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.720" end="01:00:24.500" style="s2">as compact as possible so psycho</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:30.980" style="s2">technical technology for me that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.500" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">includes prayer meditation NLP CBT would</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.980" end="01:00:39.290" style="s2">you also include all of these things yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:42.260" style="s2">I would I mean I have some criticisms of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.290" end="01:00:43.240" style="s2">NLP but let&#39;s not get into that right</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.260" end="01:00:47.210" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.240" end="01:00:49.730" style="s2">the the what it what is trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.210" end="01:00:50.920" style="s2">though I&#39;m trying to be as cautious as I</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.730" end="01:00:53.960" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.920" end="01:00:57.620" style="s2">he&#39;s a psycho technology CBT clearly is</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.960" end="01:00:59.390" style="s2">I think prayer is meditation</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.620" end="01:01:00.830" style="s2">contemplation and those shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.390" end="01:01:03.980" style="s2">identified they&#39;re different practices</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.830" end="01:01:08.060" style="s2">or psycho technologies Tai Chi Chuan is</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.980" end="01:01:10.670" style="s2">a psycho technology right yoga if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.060" end="01:01:15.110" style="s2">if it&#39;s basically created by collective</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.670" end="01:01:19.220" style="s2">intelligence and in its standardized in</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.110" end="01:01:21.500" style="s2">some fashion such that it is not just</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.220" end="01:01:25.190" style="s2">learn about by you but internalize about</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.500" end="01:01:28.910" style="s2">by you and it will have a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.190" end="01:01:30.680" style="s2">effect on many domains of your life then</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.910" end="01:01:32.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a psycho technology so the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.680" end="01:01:34.820" style="s2">prototypical example I have is literacy</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.870" end="01:01:38.360" style="s2">literacy is a standardized way of</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.820" end="01:01:41.960" style="s2">representing language right so that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.360" end="01:01:43.550" style="s2">can right afford and and you know you</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.960" end="01:01:45.350" style="s2">can deeply internalized literacy you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.550" end="01:01:46.520" style="s2">can&#39;t look at words and not read them by</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.350" end="01:01:50.300" style="s2">at this point it&#39;s called the Stroop</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.520" end="01:01:52.310" style="s2">effect right and so my if you practice</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.300" end="01:01:54.230" style="s2">mindfulness long enough it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.310" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">standardized way of training your</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.230" end="01:01:58.250" style="s2">attention if you practice it long enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:02:00.080" style="s2">it&#39;s internalized and like literacy when</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.250" end="01:02:02.210" style="s2">you lose you think of all the domains in</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.080" end="01:02:05.240" style="s2">which you use literacy that mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.210" end="01:02:08.360" style="s2">is then used usable in multiple domains</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.240" end="01:02:11.030" style="s2">or the way I have of habitus the way I</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.360" end="01:02:12.650" style="s2">have been Hobbiton happening my</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.030" end="01:02:15.320" style="s2">environment talked to me by Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.650" end="01:02:18.560" style="s2">Chuan that becomes also deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.320" end="01:02:20.510" style="s2">internalized and in in domain-general it</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.560" end="01:02:22.310" style="s2">shows up in multiple domains in my life</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.510" end="01:02:23.330" style="s2">see this is the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.310" end="01:02:25.130" style="s2">having a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.330" end="01:02:30.980" style="s2">sico technology and just acquiring a</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.130" end="01:02:33.290" style="s2">particular skill okay okay I see but</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.980" end="01:02:36.050" style="s2">when you learn tennis right tennis isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.290" end="01:02:38.570" style="s2">designed to fit your cognition and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.050" end="01:02:40.940" style="s2">enhance it in a way that will be</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.570" end="01:02:42.620" style="s2">comprehensively applied to how you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.940" end="01:02:44.900" style="s2">connect to other people the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.620" end="01:02:46.900" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.900" end="01:02:49.460" style="s2">in this very limited domain and again</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.900" end="01:02:52.880" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with skills are</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.460" end="01:02:54.530" style="s2">important they really are but a psycho</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.880" end="01:02:58.010" style="s2">technology is much more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.530" end="01:02:59.960" style="s2">and it is deeply connected it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.010" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">connected to and dependent upon</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.960" end="01:03:06.740" style="s2">collective intelligence okay okay so now</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:09.590" style="s2">I think I see why you&#39;re saying NLP may</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.740" end="01:03:11.930" style="s2">not be a psycho technology yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.590" end="01:03:15.770" style="s2">there isn&#39;t really a culture for it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.930" end="01:03:17.810" style="s2">just a skill right but the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.770" end="01:03:21.370" style="s2">though from my own experience it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.810" end="01:03:25.430" style="s2">much more effective skill than CBT but</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.370" end="01:03:28.280" style="s2">and I&#39;ve heard about that what NLP needs</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.430" end="01:03:29.870" style="s2">to do and this is not a criticism this</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.280" end="01:03:32.840" style="s2">is a statement although it might sound</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.870" end="01:03:34.610" style="s2">like a criticism NLP needs to work to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.840" end="01:03:37.040" style="s2">get the same kind of theoretical status</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.610" end="01:03:39.530" style="s2">and empirical evidence that CBT house</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.040" end="01:03:41.570" style="s2">for it and it does not it has not done</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.530" end="01:03:43.490" style="s2">that successfully I&#39;m not saying it</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.570" end="01:03:47.630" style="s2">can&#39;t I&#39;m not making a criticism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.490" end="01:03:49.370" style="s2">making a statement right yes and and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.630" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">would agree I think the reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.370" end="01:03:55.780" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have to talk about this I</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.460" end="01:03:59.870" style="s2">love I love NLP I find it so fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.780" end="01:04:03.590" style="s2">the main reason I love NLP though is dr.</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.870" end="01:04:07.940" style="s2">Bandler the co-founder reading his books</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.590" end="01:04:09.860" style="s2">is like so much fun because half of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.940" end="01:04:12.290" style="s2">he&#39;s just saying yeah I you know I</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.860" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">walked into some mental hospital and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.290" end="01:04:15.460" style="s2">know that Guy&#39;d schizophrenia I went Bam</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:18.140" style="s2">Bam Bam not anymore</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.460" end="01:04:24.320" style="s2">you know he&#39;s just like a crazy wizard</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.140" end="01:04:27.530" style="s2">guy and anyway maybe it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.320" end="01:04:29.840" style="s2">but oh oh oh I think because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.530" end="01:04:33.080" style="s2">such a playful thing where it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.840" end="01:04:35.060" style="s2">focus is on just doing it the the people</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.080" end="01:04:36.859" style="s2">who are really good at it will never</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.060" end="01:04:39.049" style="s2">waste their time doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.859" end="01:04:41.239" style="s2">studies because they&#39;ll just tear their</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.049" end="01:04:44.690" style="s2">hair out you know and they could be</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.239" end="01:04:47.420" style="s2">doing so much more cool stuff but we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.690" end="01:04:50.450" style="s2">forget about that we should talk more</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.420" end="01:04:52.579" style="s2">about meta psycho technology so yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.450" end="01:04:53.900" style="s2">this and I&#39;m glad you brought up Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.579" end="01:04:56.150" style="s2">I mean some of the most important</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.900" end="01:04:58.640" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve had in my life have</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.150" end="01:05:01.849" style="s2">been with him he&#39;s a fantastic person to</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.640" end="01:05:04.910" style="s2">have a discussion with becoming friends</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.849" end="01:05:09.890" style="s2">and I value that a lot and it was him he</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.910" end="01:05:11.539" style="s2">was he very me the idea of a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.890" end="01:05:14.059" style="s2">technology that what I what I was</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.539" end="01:05:18.380" style="s2">talking about and then this is what I</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.059" end="01:05:20.420" style="s2">think dialectic ultimately is dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.380" end="01:05:24.200" style="s2">is a meta psycho technology that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.420" end="01:05:28.249" style="s2">basically it puts you into right it puts</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.200" end="01:05:30.739" style="s2">you both into the world view and into</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:47.329" style="s2">that that for me the ancient practice of</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.499" end="01:05:49.549" style="s2">dialectic as it was practiced in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.329" end="01:05:52.039" style="s2">Platonic and Neoplatonic schools all the</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.779" end="01:05:57.289" style="s2">my next video series after Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.460" end="01:05:58.869" style="s2">trying to understand and this is work</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.289" end="01:06:02.210" style="s2">that Chris and I have been writing about</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.869" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">ancient dialectic and I and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.210" end="01:06:05.390" style="s2">put it into a DeeDee and I want to use</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:07.609" style="s2">it as a template I&#39;m not trying to go</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.390" end="01:06:10.160" style="s2">back to the past I&#39;m trying to salvage</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.609" end="01:06:12.920" style="s2">what I can from the past and put that</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.160" end="01:06:15.769" style="s2">into dialogue and I&#39;m intending that</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.920" end="01:06:18.950" style="s2">word with what what is emerging now all</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.769" end="01:06:21.200" style="s2">of these practices of discourse and</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.950" end="01:06:24.019" style="s2">collective intelligence so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.200" end="01:06:28.099" style="s2">try to get a meta sacred technology</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.019" end="01:06:30.049" style="s2">analogous to what dialectic was in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.099" end="01:06:31.519" style="s2">ancient world which was the meta second</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.049" end="01:06:40.420" style="s2">technology for all of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.519" end="01:06:44.359" style="s2">traditions my first question is how does</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.420" end="01:06:46.190" style="s2">dialectic give us a worldview so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.359" end="01:06:49.400" style="s2">have to understand that dialectic isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.190" end="01:06:50.510" style="s2">just argumentation right so the Platonic</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.400" end="01:06:52.220" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.510" end="01:06:55.130" style="s2">the premiere place to look for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.220" end="01:06:58.040" style="s2">going on right so right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.130" end="01:07:00.490" style="s2">argumentation that&#39;s also integrated</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.040" end="01:07:03.110" style="s2">with the process of encountering a sage</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.490" end="01:07:05.150" style="s2">internalizing the sage having moments of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.110" end="01:07:08.210" style="s2">insight I mean you&#39;re a very sense of</p>

<p begin="01:07:10.520" end="01:07:14.810" style="s2">of this is being happened and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.080" end="01:07:17.780" style="s2">happening within right a forum in which</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.810" end="01:07:19.790" style="s2">people are doing two things in a deeply</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.790" end="01:07:26.030" style="s2">to do is they&#39;re trying to get right</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.210" end="01:07:27.530" style="s2">collective intelligence forming right</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.030" end="01:07:29.360" style="s2">because in play right you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.530" end="01:07:31.550" style="s2">get right all the different perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.360" end="01:07:33.770" style="s2">to talk to each other and talk having</p>

<p begin="01:07:36.860" end="01:07:39.500" style="s2">dialogues is you&#39;re not just seeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.060" end="01:07:41.810" style="s2">competing arguments you&#39;re seeing</p>

<p begin="01:07:46.550" end="01:07:51.740" style="s2">each other right right and that so</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.730" end="01:07:54.620" style="s2">dialectic is that but dialectic is also</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.740" end="01:07:56.690" style="s2">something you do right individually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.620" end="01:07:59.480" style="s2">something in which you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.690" end="01:08:01.070" style="s2">write learn how to move up and down if</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.480" end="01:08:03.770" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me that metaphor your</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.070" end="01:08:06.080" style="s2">worldview in a disciplined manner so</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.770" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">that you can get a deep understanding of</p>

<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:13.310" style="s2">grammar of your worldview and so you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:08:13.310" end="01:08:18.170" style="s2">these two gestural metaphors right with</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.670" end="01:08:22.310" style="s2">your worldview and then you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.170" end="01:08:25.220" style="s2">this with all of your perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.310" end="01:08:28.030" style="s2">ways of life and and then you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.220" end="01:08:30.970" style="s2">to weave that together with</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.030" end="01:08:33.730" style="s2">argumentation trying to get our best</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.970" end="01:08:36.710" style="s2">discourse practices and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.730" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">dialectic is where you need to go if</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.710" end="01:08:43.900" style="s2">you&#39;re going to try and write create a</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.920" end="01:08:43.900" style="s2">new culture of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.089" end="01:08:51.270" style="s2">the thing is in my head like I see what</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.750" end="01:08:54.719" style="s2">you&#39;re saying but I don&#39;t see how it can</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.270" end="01:08:59.159" style="s2">grow from just two smart guys in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.719" end="01:09:01.460" style="s2">woods so that&#39;s the question that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.159" end="01:09:04.650" style="s2">question well first of all you can get</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.460" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">multiple people doing it and then and</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.650" end="01:09:09.089" style="s2">this is work I&#39;m doing especially with</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:11.849" style="s2">both Chris and Peter Lindbergh right you</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.089" end="01:09:14.549" style="s2">you don&#39;t want you wait you want to get</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.849" end="01:09:16.710" style="s2">basically a program of practices you</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.549" end="01:09:18.779" style="s2">want to start with something like and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.710" end="01:09:20.909" style="s2">when Russia&#39;s notion of empathy circling</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.779" end="01:09:22.500" style="s2">that you do with for people because what</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.909" end="01:09:24.270" style="s2">it does is it get it moves people from</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.500" end="01:09:27.239" style="s2">bad faith to good faith dialogue and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.270" end="01:09:29.250" style="s2">then you might want to do some some</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.239" end="01:09:30.599" style="s2">basic circling what the I said start</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.250" end="01:09:31.920" style="s2">talks about where you just work on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.599" end="01:09:34.380" style="s2">community and you can do that with</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.920" end="01:09:36.539" style="s2">multiple people and then you can get</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.380" end="01:09:38.279" style="s2">people to start to bring in some aspects</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.539" end="01:09:41.099" style="s2">from like things like insight dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.279" end="01:09:42.750" style="s2">and then you can bring in aspects of all</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.099" end="01:09:44.489" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m working on all of this right</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.750" end="01:09:46.049" style="s2">now with people and what you can do is</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.489" end="01:09:48.109" style="s2">you can take people through a sequence</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.049" end="01:09:51.719" style="s2">of practices that takes them from</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.109" end="01:09:53.969" style="s2">adversarial doctrinal conflict into what</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.719" end="01:09:55.590" style="s2">you and I are doing here and now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.969" end="01:09:58.889" style="s2">the work I&#39;m doing with both Chris and</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.590" end="01:10:02.699" style="s2">Peter and you know and and and I sensed</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.889" end="01:10:04.079" style="s2">on especially in Jordan Hall and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.699" end="01:10:05.730" style="s2">know and the people within my own</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.079" end="01:10:07.650" style="s2">particular circling group and the people</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.730" end="01:10:09.599" style="s2">I&#39;ve been meeting like Edwin and like</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.650" end="01:10:11.579" style="s2">I&#39;m doing participant observation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.599" end="01:10:14.429" style="s2">actually ongoing I&#39;m not just theorizing</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.579" end="01:10:15.389" style="s2">going in and immersing myself in this as</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.429" end="01:10:17.610" style="s2">much as I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.389" end="01:10:18.809" style="s2">participant observation trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.610" end="01:10:21.900" style="s2">the truth that can only be realized</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.809" end="01:10:23.880" style="s2">through transformation and so that and</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.900" end="01:10:25.139" style="s2">then and then taking that this is what I</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.880" end="01:10:26.969" style="s2">mean about the bottom up and the top</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.139" end="01:10:31.020" style="s2">down and then saying okay how could we</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.969" end="01:10:32.730" style="s2">possibly optimally configure a program</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.020" end="01:10:35.460" style="s2">of these practices that could take</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.730" end="01:10:37.409" style="s2">anybody on the street and take them</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.460" end="01:10:40.619" style="s2">through this I mean I can&#39;t give people</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.409" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">their motivation that&#39;s right what I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.619" end="01:10:48.440" style="s2">do is write offer people here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:48.440" style="s2">something that will take you there</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.530" end="01:10:56.540" style="s2">do you not can you mention any other</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.660" end="01:10:57.500" style="s2">concrete examples of meta psycho</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.540" end="01:10:59.870" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.500" end="01:11:06.260" style="s2">I&#39;m still trying to like get a good</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.870" end="01:11:11.000" style="s2">picture of what it is well so if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.260" end="01:11:12.320" style="s2">think about an ecology of practice and</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.000" end="01:11:16.810" style="s2">then you have to have something that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.320" end="01:11:20.810" style="s2">taps into the collective intelligence of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.810" end="01:11:22.720" style="s2">the community by which decisions can be</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.810" end="01:11:26.240" style="s2">made for the community as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.720" end="01:11:29.750" style="s2">so Metis meta psycho technology must</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.240" end="01:11:31.610" style="s2">include a community it must be more than</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.750" end="01:11:33.770" style="s2">one person right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.610" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">because again we&#39;re back to you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.770" end="01:11:44.270" style="s2">create a culture on your own it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:51.800" style="s2">make any sense so yeah so if you think</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.270" end="01:11:53.480" style="s2">about what you see sorry I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.800" end="01:11:56.960" style="s2">to be I&#39;m not trying to force this by</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.480" end="01:11:59.900" style="s2">being you know a fallacy of exclusion</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.960" end="01:12:02.410" style="s2">exclusiveness but if you like let&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.900" end="01:12:05.420" style="s2">like say take a look at like the church</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.410" end="01:12:07.010" style="s2">right you know you have all of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.420" end="01:12:08.390" style="s2">ecologies of practices people are</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.010" end="01:12:10.190" style="s2">praying and they&#39;re doing all that but</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.390" end="01:12:12.440" style="s2">what you have is you also have this way</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.190" end="01:12:14.120" style="s2">in which you know coops of people get</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.440" end="01:12:16.550" style="s2">together they have conclaves or they</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.120" end="01:12:19.610" style="s2">have councils in which and what do they</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.550" end="01:12:21.920" style="s2">do they discuss and argue that and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.610" end="01:12:24.470" style="s2">try to get a process by which they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:12:24.470" end="01:12:30.200" style="s2">practices that make up right their</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.020" end="01:12:31.070" style="s2">tradition that&#39;s work that so right not</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.200" end="01:12:32.660" style="s2">only do you see it within the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.070" end="01:12:34.250" style="s2">philosophical context what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.660" end="01:12:37.340" style="s2">about you see it within the leaders</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.250" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">context too now the problem is how do</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.340" end="01:12:47.150" style="s2">you do that without you know binding</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:51.410" style="s2">people to a an unchangeable Creed so</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.150" end="01:12:54.530" style="s2">that could be where a lot of Western</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.410" end="01:12:56.300" style="s2">religion is failing is the psycho</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.530" end="01:12:58.820" style="s2">technologies are still there but the</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.300" end="01:13:01.670" style="s2">meta psycho technology is like where is</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.820" end="01:13:03.560" style="s2">it you know like especially in in like</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.670" end="01:13:07.310" style="s2">the Catholic Church for example</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.560" end="01:13:09.950" style="s2">of a very well structured hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.310" end="01:13:13.420" style="s2">which is really excellent you know for</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.950" end="01:13:17.510" style="s2">doing what that&#39;s good at but for for a</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.420" end="01:13:20.000" style="s2">continuous evolution of practice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.510" end="01:13:21.860" style="s2">gonna say that this yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.000" end="01:13:24.260" style="s2">so this is the trick right the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.860" end="01:13:25.640" style="s2">difficulty is right is you meta cycle</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.260" end="01:13:29.830" style="s2">technology and your metaphysics are</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.640" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">deeply interwoven together in a way yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.830" end="01:13:39.620" style="s2">and so you need set up like patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:43.190" style="s2">the meta Seco technology in which what</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.620" end="01:13:46.460" style="s2">you just said is made central I would</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.190" end="01:13:48.890" style="s2">even say made sacred which is this what</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.460" end="01:13:51.770" style="s2">above all what this has to do is it has</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.890" end="01:13:53.930" style="s2">to be able to evolve it has to be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.770" end="01:13:57.350" style="s2">to evolve and here&#39;s what Jordan and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.930" end="01:13:59.480" style="s2">have argued that and this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.350" end="01:14:01.760" style="s2">foreclosure argument I would not dare to</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.480" end="01:14:04.280" style="s2">pronounce on an entire religion and say</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.760" end="01:14:07.130" style="s2">it&#39;s doomed okay I think what people who</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.280" end="01:14:10.780" style="s2">do that are seriously either arrogant or</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.130" end="01:14:14.900" style="s2">naivete right but naive they should say</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.780" end="01:14:16.970" style="s2">but Jordan I and I met Chris and I also</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.900" end="01:14:19.130" style="s2">as well right and we are not anti</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.970" end="01:14:21.140" style="s2">religious I want that really clearly</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.130" end="01:14:23.630" style="s2">understood but we feel that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.140" end="01:14:26.300" style="s2">established religions the interweaving</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.630" end="01:14:28.580" style="s2">of their metaphysics their mythos and</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.300" end="01:14:30.410" style="s2">their meta psycho technology those three</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.580" end="01:14:31.910" style="s2">are deeps it&#39;s the three MS are</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.410" end="01:14:33.890" style="s2">interwoven together you have a two</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.910" end="01:14:35.660" style="s2">worlds myth you have a particular kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.890" end="01:14:37.190" style="s2">of supernatural istic metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.660" end="01:14:39.200" style="s2">then you have a meta</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.190" end="01:14:40.940" style="s2">psycho technology attached to all that</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.200" end="01:14:46.580" style="s2">there&#39;s interwove inand inter defining</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.940" end="01:14:52.790" style="s2">we think that is so bound to a rate of</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.580" end="01:14:55.640" style="s2">change and an obsolete worldview try not</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.790" end="01:14:57.860" style="s2">to be harsher that we do not think it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.640" end="01:15:01.720" style="s2">capable of evolving in ways that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.860" end="01:15:04.790" style="s2">needed for right now that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.720" end="01:15:05.810" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what I think Jordan means</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.790" end="01:15:07.460" style="s2">when he&#39;s talking about you know the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.810" end="01:15:08.810" style="s2">blue church and the red church and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.460" end="01:15:13.160" style="s2">talking about you know and game a and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.810" end="01:15:15.230" style="s2">gave me that the that interweaving of</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.160" end="01:15:16.520" style="s2">mythos metaphysics and meta secular</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.230" end="01:15:17.419" style="s2">technologies in the established</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.520" end="01:15:18.949" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.419" end="01:15:20.389" style="s2">you see it happening in other religions</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.949" end="01:15:23.840" style="s2">too right it&#39;s happening also within</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.389" end="01:15:25.610" style="s2">Buddhism as it&#39;s coming in too deep</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.840" end="01:15:28.399" style="s2">contact with the west&#39;s meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.610" end="01:15:32.419" style="s2">is you so you see very famous people</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.399" end="01:15:34.729" style="s2">people that I know personally some even</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.419" end="01:15:37.519" style="s2">but like I&#39;ve met them personally or</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.729" end="01:15:40.039" style="s2">that Steven batch there or I I know him</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.519" end="01:15:42.409" style="s2">as a colleague and a friend Ivan</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.039" end="01:15:44.090" style="s2">Thompson people who you know are deeply</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.409" end="01:15:45.769" style="s2">important in the Western Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.090" end="01:15:47.809" style="s2">community who or have both published</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.769" end="01:15:50.539" style="s2">books on why they&#39;re not though there</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.809" end="01:15:52.729" style="s2">are no longer Buddhists Steven is</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.539" end="01:15:54.349" style="s2">published after Buddhism and haven&#39;t has</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.729" end="01:16:01.039" style="s2">published why I&#39;m not a Buddhist and</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.349" end="01:16:04.219" style="s2">they basically write say that the idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.039" end="01:16:07.369" style="s2">that Buddhism for example it has some</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.219" end="01:16:08.510" style="s2">somehow an exception to this problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.369" end="01:16:10.369" style="s2">that I&#39;m putting my finger on</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.510" end="01:16:13.429" style="s2">they basically criticize that and say no</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.369" end="01:16:16.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not an exception it also is falling</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.429" end="01:16:19.039" style="s2">prey to these kinds of problems that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.820" end="01:16:20.510" style="s2">and I are talking about so we need this</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.039" end="01:16:22.610" style="s2">is a way this takes us back to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.510" end="01:16:25.070" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.610" end="01:16:28.519" style="s2">to write we we have to tip the balance</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.070" end="01:16:31.399" style="s2">right because because the rate of change</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.519" end="01:16:33.639" style="s2">was what it used to be we could give</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.399" end="01:16:35.780" style="s2">priority to being very conservative</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.639" end="01:16:37.219" style="s2">right in the evolution but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.780" end="01:16:40.130" style="s2">things you notice in biological</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.219" end="01:16:42.739" style="s2">evolution is the rate of change is in</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.130" end="01:16:45.199" style="s2">constant the rate of change has to shift</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.739" end="01:16:47.659" style="s2">as the rate of change in the environment</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.199" end="01:16:51.199" style="s2">shifts and we&#39;re at entered entering a</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.659" end="01:16:53.090" style="s2">period of very rapid change and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.199" end="01:16:55.820" style="s2">only that the change is increasing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.090" end="01:16:58.010" style="s2">the rate of change he&#39;s increasing right</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.820" end="01:17:01.130" style="s2">and so that we can&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.010" end="01:17:04.669" style="s2">we can&#39;t have a conservative evolution</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.130" end="01:17:07.820" style="s2">right constraint anymore we have to push</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.669" end="01:17:12.349" style="s2">it more towards creativity it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.820" end="01:17:18.530" style="s2">much more fluid and flowing right now</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.349" end="01:17:22.849" style="s2">and so Jordan and I suspect that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.530" end="01:17:25.969" style="s2">established religions aren&#39;t capable of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.849" end="01:17:28.699" style="s2">shifting the mythos metaphysics medicine</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.969" end="01:17:30.940" style="s2">technology in such a way that it will be</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.699" end="01:17:34.460" style="s2">able to get out of Allah</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.940" end="01:17:36.860" style="s2">conservative bias in how it constrains</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.460" end="01:17:39.710" style="s2">the evolution and move much more into a</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.860" end="01:17:42.110" style="s2">creative bias in how it directs the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.710" end="01:17:44.179" style="s2">evolution sorry that was a lot to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.110" end="01:17:47.690" style="s2">but that&#39;s a very that was very good</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.179" end="01:17:50.480" style="s2">this very poignant spent the last</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.690" end="01:17:54.920" style="s2">sentence that was amazing what I&#39;m what</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.480" end="01:17:58.310" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking to myself is from being you</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.920" end="01:18:02.449" style="s2">know I guess deeply involved at least to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.310" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">whatever degree I have been I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.449" end="01:18:07.310" style="s2">that change</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:08.840" style="s2">you know I mean even but but I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.310" end="01:18:10.940" style="s2">it&#39;s worse than than what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.840" end="01:18:13.100" style="s2">because even if there&#39;s a religion</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.940" end="01:18:15.770" style="s2">without a religion I think even that</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.100" end="01:18:20.600" style="s2">will eventually have this conservative</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.770" end="01:18:24.980" style="s2">bias again and again and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.600" end="01:18:29.090" style="s2">hopes is that we could get it we could</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.980" end="01:18:32.420" style="s2">get it at least enough to know what do I</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.090" end="01:18:35.330" style="s2">want to say global enough pluralistic</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.420" end="01:18:37.880" style="s2">enough that the conservative bias can</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.330" end="01:18:40.130" style="s2">never take root sort of comprehensively</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.880" end="01:18:44.480" style="s2">it would be something in which it might</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.130" end="01:18:46.100" style="s2">do it here but right that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.480" end="01:18:47.960" style="s2">and now you&#39;re asking me to pronounce on</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.100" end="01:18:49.670" style="s2">areas where I don&#39;t have very much</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.960" end="01:18:52.310" style="s2">confidence because there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.670" end="01:18:54.469" style="s2">knowledge upon which I could make a</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.310" end="01:18:59.000" style="s2">claim I&#39;m trying to articulate a vision</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.469" end="01:19:02.630" style="s2">that I think is viable and again I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.000" end="01:19:03.530" style="s2">it&#39;s very important that you and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.630" end="01:19:06.770" style="s2">allowed me to take you as a</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.530" end="01:19:09.080" style="s2">representative of the nuns again notice</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.770" end="01:19:12.050" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s sort of a point for you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.080" end="01:19:14.420" style="s2">that like I just don&#39;t see them capable</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.050" end="01:19:17.179" style="s2">of doing it right which is not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.420" end="01:19:18.500" style="s2">believe in God or I don&#39;t know yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.179" end="01:19:20.929" style="s2">just like no no I just</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.500" end="01:19:22.699" style="s2">they&#39;re they seem if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.929" end="01:19:24.139" style="s2">this adjective and I don&#39;t mean it to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.699" end="01:19:26.119" style="s2">insulting so I&#39;m trying to choose it</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.139" end="01:19:28.580" style="s2">carefully there&#39;s people like deeply</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.119" end="01:19:30.770" style="s2">respect like paul van der clay and</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.580" end="01:19:33.560" style="s2">jonathan pazzo and mary cohen and</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.770" end="01:19:35.449" style="s2">jameise alright i think they matter to</p>

<p begin="01:19:35.449" end="01:19:43.130" style="s2">really good work but many nuns and omes</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.510" end="01:19:43.989" style="s2">find that the established religions are</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.130" end="01:19:46.179" style="s2">ossified</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.989" end="01:19:48.249" style="s2">they&#39;re ossified they they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.179" end="01:19:53.199" style="s2">don&#39;t feel that they have that vitality</p>

<p begin="01:19:53.199" end="01:19:57.579" style="s2">the fundamental level</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.840" end="01:19:59.829" style="s2">so one thing you know you&#39;re missing</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.110" end="01:20:16.150" style="s2">Krishna devotee gurus out there but they</p>

<p begin="01:20:16.150" end="01:20:20.469" style="s2">like you know like when there&#39;s a really</p>

<p begin="01:20:23.139" end="01:20:31.139" style="s2">that it&#39;s like this is why I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.749" end="01:20:34.659" style="s2">hesitant and you heard me earlier I</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.139" end="01:20:37.360" style="s2">expressed what I try to express a</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.659" end="01:20:40.920" style="s2">conclusion that Jordan Hall and I share</p>

<p begin="01:21:04.929" end="01:21:09.429" style="s2">not so let me say this very carefully</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.210" end="01:21:11.590" style="s2">they represent what Christianity needs</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.429" end="01:21:17.349" style="s2">to be doing but I am not convinced their</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.590" end="01:21:18.010" style="s2">representative of Christianity I let me</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.349" end="01:21:20.769" style="s2">be clear I do</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.010" end="01:21:22.599" style="s2">I&#39;m not calling their identification in</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.769" end="01:21:25.030" style="s2">question I think they are sincere and</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.090" end="01:21:45.039" style="s2">there&#39;s one example that came into my</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.499" end="01:21:47.619" style="s2">head from like there&#39;s oh there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.039" end="01:21:51.999" style="s2">many examples of this ossification it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.619" end="01:21:55.840" style="s2">a good word for it like these these</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.999" end="01:21:57.700" style="s2">incredible scholars they you know some</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.840" end="01:22:00.850" style="s2">of these guys have PhDs and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.700" end="01:22:03.210" style="s2">Indian theology from you know really</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.850" end="01:22:06.640" style="s2">excellent people they did this huge</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.210" end="01:22:09.820" style="s2">seminar conference on bhagavad-gita and</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.640" end="01:22:13.540" style="s2">the ancient Vedas and they like nobody</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.820" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">showed up from the central temple Church</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.540" end="01:22:19.260" style="s2">authority they said oh we&#39;re busy that</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit our schedule and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.260" end="01:22:28.840" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that you thought so I have</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.840" end="01:22:31.630" style="s2">to be going we provide an hour and a</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.840" end="01:22:33.010" style="s2">half is there any final question you</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.630" end="01:22:36.460" style="s2">want to ask me or anything you want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.010" end="01:22:40.900" style="s2">do of a summative nature I there is one</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.460" end="01:22:42.970" style="s2">thing that yes Paul bender clay spoke</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.900" end="01:22:43.540" style="s2">about this and it&#39;s stuck with me big</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.970" end="01:22:46.840" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.540" end="01:22:50.440" style="s2">the now versus the eternal I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.840" end="01:22:54.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a fundamental or the always yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.440" end="01:23:05.110" style="s2">that&#39;s so okay so I guess where does</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.460" end="01:23:06.790" style="s2">that look okay let me get my thesis Oh</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.110" end="01:23:09.880" style="s2">so as I was saying earlier about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.790" end="01:23:13.480" style="s2">Bible like a Bible people don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.880" end="01:23:16.440" style="s2">Bible or a sacred master another problem</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.480" end="01:23:19.000" style="s2">here in this meaning crisis is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.440" end="01:23:22.150" style="s2">people are staying too much in the now</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.000" end="01:23:25.110" style="s2">and they they&#39;ve they&#39;ve kind of lost a</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.150" end="01:23:30.160" style="s2">connection with that eternal realm which</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.110" end="01:23:35.470" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll stop there I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.160" end="01:23:37.660" style="s2">important and I think that we that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.470" end="01:23:40.420" style="s2">I tried to talk about those two</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.660" end="01:23:41.860" style="s2">dimensions this dimension is right the</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.420" end="01:23:45.100" style="s2">dimension where we&#39;re communing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.860" end="01:23:47.950" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to evolve of dialectic this</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.100" end="01:23:49.690" style="s2">is the dimension of right the emanation</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.950" end="01:23:52.360" style="s2">and the emergence this is the this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.690" end="01:23:53.890" style="s2">the dimension of right the eternal</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.360" end="01:23:56.920" style="s2">dimension where we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.890" end="01:23:58.840" style="s2">depths of reality right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.920" end="01:24:00.970" style="s2">this is like the depths of reality and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.840" end="01:24:03.130" style="s2">this is these are this is the evolution</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.970" end="01:24:06.010" style="s2">of realization and we need them</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.130" end="01:24:08.110" style="s2">constantly talking together you and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.010" end="01:24:11.080" style="s2">right have to be of all constantly</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.110" end="01:24:14.440" style="s2">evolving in the now right what</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.080" end="01:24:17.350" style="s2">needed in order to have you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.440" end="01:24:20.160" style="s2">this in order to reach and help the nuns</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.350" end="01:24:23.440" style="s2">and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to sound</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.160" end="01:24:25.030" style="s2">patronizing but that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.440" end="01:24:30.100" style="s2">this what I&#39;m trying to do in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.030" end="01:24:31.570" style="s2">right but that has to also do this right</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.100" end="01:24:34.620" style="s2">it has to give people the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.570" end="01:24:39.070" style="s2">connecting to what&#39;s most real</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.620" end="01:24:40.900" style="s2">what&#39;s ultimate and so that&#39;s again why</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.070" end="01:24:44.410" style="s2">I think dialectic is important those two</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.900" end="01:24:48.460" style="s2">dimensions of dialectic right there the</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.410" end="01:24:52.650" style="s2">the levels of reality and the stages of</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.460" end="01:24:56.290" style="s2">realization have to be constantly kept</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.650" end="01:24:57.940" style="s2">really tightly communing together in</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.290" end="01:25:00.000" style="s2">within the process of dialectic and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.940" end="01:25:02.680" style="s2">see it in Plato you you see for example</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.000" end="01:25:05.320" style="s2">in the dialogue Socrates will come and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.680" end="01:25:07.840" style="s2">you&#39;ll see Socrates adjust like you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.320" end="01:25:10.210" style="s2">see him evolving so he fits the person</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.840" end="01:25:11.740" style="s2">he&#39;s talking to and he you can even see</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.210" end="01:25:14.500" style="s2">it within the same so there&#39;s the now</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.740" end="01:25:16.570" style="s2">right he&#39;s fitting he&#39;s fluid and</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.500" end="01:25:18.820" style="s2">adaptive and he&#39;s not trying to bring</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.570" end="01:25:21.010" style="s2">anything to closure or completion but</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.820" end="01:25:23.470" style="s2">nevertheless we&#39;re getting discussions</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.010" end="01:25:26.940" style="s2">of you know the levels of reality and</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.470" end="01:25:29.980" style="s2">what is most you know what is most real</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.940" end="01:25:33.520" style="s2">both of those are happening woven</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.980" end="01:25:38.260" style="s2">together okay yeah Socrates is excellent</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.520" end="01:25:39.670" style="s2">example okay I think so I think so too</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.260" end="01:25:43.900" style="s2">part of what I&#39;m trying to do is</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.670" end="01:25:46.300" style="s2">recommend him more strongly to us as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.900" end="01:25:48.160" style="s2">culture again not because I think we can</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.300" end="01:25:51.040" style="s2">return back to the ancient Greek world</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.160" end="01:25:53.140" style="s2">I&#39;m deeply critical of nostalgia but</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.040" end="01:25:55.570" style="s2">because he serves as a valuable template</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.140" end="01:25:57.490" style="s2">for what we&#39;re trying to bring to give</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.570" end="01:26:02.710" style="s2">birth to right now and Socrates called</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.490" end="01:26:04.540" style="s2">himself a midwife right yeah ma model</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.710" end="01:26:07.870" style="s2">and paradigm for trying to give birth to</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.540" end="01:26:09.490" style="s2">something that is not yet fully born it</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.870" end="01:26:12.940" style="s2">seems like there&#39;s a very Christian</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.490" end="01:26:15.010" style="s2">story to it Socrates and his death yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.940" end="01:26:16.870" style="s2">and there&#39;s probably people have argued</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.010" end="01:26:21.010" style="s2">there&#39;s probably historical connections</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.870" end="01:26:24.909" style="s2">between the Socratic legend right and</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.010" end="01:26:30.969" style="s2">how it gets taken up into some of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.909" end="01:26:34.539" style="s2">story of Jesus&#39;s passion and that would</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.969" end="01:26:38.050" style="s2">make a good historical sense to me given</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.539" end="01:26:39.999" style="s2">that Jesus is he&#39;s moving around in you</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.050" end="01:26:41.829" style="s2">know the what&#39;s I can&#39;t remember the</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.999" end="01:26:43.809" style="s2">Greek name there&#39;s ten Greek cities he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.829" end="01:26:46.389" style="s2">actually living in a very Hellenized</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.809" end="01:26:50.229" style="s2">part of Palestine when he&#39;s doing his</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.389" end="01:26:52.479" style="s2">mission I think it was who was it who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.229" end="01:26:54.939" style="s2">arguing about he has in fact some of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.479" end="01:26:57.579" style="s2">actual tropes of an itinerant cynic</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.939" end="01:26:59.619" style="s2">philosopher he&#39;s not he is not just a</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.579" end="01:27:02.499" style="s2">cynic philosopher I am NOT saying that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.619" end="01:27:04.059" style="s2">but there&#39;s clearly a cultural influence</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.499" end="01:27:05.860" style="s2">he&#39;s also deeply influenced of course by</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.059" end="01:27:07.689" style="s2">the Israelite prophetic tradition he</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.860" end="01:27:09.669" style="s2">seems to be wetting them together in</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.689" end="01:27:12.010" style="s2">some really powerful and interesting way</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.669" end="01:27:16.119" style="s2">and so it there might have been that</p>
