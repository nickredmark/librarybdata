<p begin="00:00:10.349" end="00:00:14.349" style="s2">okay I&#39;m here with my good friend</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.490" end="00:00:16.209" style="s2">Stephen Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.349" end="00:00:18.160" style="s2">Stephen Lewis likes to think about</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.209" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">things in fact I don&#39;t know another guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.160" end="00:00:25.720" style="s2">who thinks so much about so many things</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:27.970" style="s2">almost no a couple people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.720" end="00:00:30.399" style="s2">who I really think and you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.970" end="00:00:32.770" style="s2">them so I kind of landed on a Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.399" end="00:00:35.350" style="s2">interpretation of Christianity I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.770" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">one of the reasons was a Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.350" end="00:00:40.989" style="s2">interpretation of Rene Girard that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:44.249" style="s2">and one of the reasons was I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.989" end="00:00:44.249" style="s2">fascinated I was obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:50.710" style="s2">anti-semitism and trying to resolve that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.850" end="00:00:53.589" style="s2">problem in the context of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.710" end="00:00:56.710" style="s2">and so I was kind of working on that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.589" end="00:01:01.839" style="s2">my head for a long time and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.710" end="00:01:03.519" style="s2">me that Rene Girard developed a theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.839" end="00:01:06.190" style="s2">which which completely reconciled</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.519" end="00:01:07.780" style="s2">Christianity and Judaism this was kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.190" end="00:01:09.880" style="s2">of my Jewish moment even though it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.780" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">from reading a Christian thinker and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.880" end="00:01:19.030" style="s2">Jewish moment is the what Rene Girard</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:21.790" style="s2">claims to be the absolute he Rene Girard</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.030" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">claims that he articulated the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.790" end="00:01:25.149" style="s2">which is a very strong statement then</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:29.439" style="s2">you knew he was making a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.149" end="00:01:31.990" style="s2">statement huh and the way he he he</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:34.299" style="s2">states that in his writing is is done in</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.990" end="00:01:36.700" style="s2">a very tricky way he he comes out and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.299" end="00:01:38.469" style="s2">this big blasting surprised to say yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.700" end="00:01:41.500" style="s2">guess what this is it&#39;s the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.469" end="00:01:45.640" style="s2">this is actually what it is and and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.500" end="00:01:48.729" style="s2">absolute is one simple phrase it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.640" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">defense of the innocent victim that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.729" end="00:01:58.750" style="s2">what the absolute is and he it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:01.030" style="s2">long theory there&#39;s a in elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.750" end="00:02:06.850" style="s2">theory he develops before he leads the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.030" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">the the reader to that moment and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.850" end="00:02:10.270" style="s2">theory that he developed for I think in</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">the 1960s he said it took him a long</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.270" end="00:02:17.319" style="s2">time to proper figure out how he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:20.140" style="s2">gonna how he was going to articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.319" end="00:02:21.879" style="s2">he took it took years to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.140" end="00:02:23.349" style="s2">he was gonna say it but he understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.879" end="00:02:26.290" style="s2">the theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.349" end="00:02:27.939" style="s2">a long time before so was 1970s that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.290" end="00:02:31.749" style="s2">broke that theory in the early seventies</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.939" end="00:02:34.780" style="s2">and for me it was a very big deal I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.749" end="00:02:37.900" style="s2">from to me it&#39;s probably it he may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.780" end="00:02:40.180" style="s2">the most important Hurst Perry it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.900" end="00:02:42.250" style="s2">such because he also he identifies so</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.180" end="00:02:46.120" style="s2">many things he identifies at least he</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.250" end="00:02:48.659" style="s2">claims to and the what he thinks is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.120" end="00:02:52.269" style="s2">is the foundation of human culture and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.659" end="00:02:54.519" style="s2">it more or less it&#39;s the moment a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.269" end="00:02:58.989" style="s2">recurring moment that happened millions</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.519" end="00:03:00.909" style="s2">and millions of times and it in way back</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.989" end="00:03:02.230" style="s2">in prehistory mostly but also continuing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.909" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">into history and progressively</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.230" end="00:03:11.500" style="s2">diminishing where we slowly created a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">social construct which separated us from</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.500" end="00:03:18.939" style="s2">our animal origins from our it it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:23.769" style="s2">created a created a social super</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.939" end="00:03:28.329" style="s2">imposition upon our biological beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.769" end="00:03:30.579" style="s2">and it was a very very dark thing what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.329" end="00:03:34.329" style="s2">happened but nonetheless it is the raw</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.579" end="00:03:36.280" style="s2">material with which we construct society</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.329" end="00:03:37.750" style="s2">and culture today tonight can I stop you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.280" end="00:03:38.620" style="s2">for a second because I just had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.750" end="00:03:41.079" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.620" end="00:03:42.579" style="s2">is that the story of Cain and Abel right</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.079" end="00:03:45.009" style="s2">which is the story of the first people</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.579" end="00:03:47.889" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s totally related to Cain and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.009" end="00:03:50.409" style="s2">Abel it&#39;s more it&#39;s closer to Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.889" end="00:03:51.790" style="s2">the story of Abraham and Isaac then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.409" end="00:03:53.709" style="s2">story of Cain and what is very-- it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.790" end="00:03:56.650" style="s2">all related like the Bible the Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.709" end="00:04:00.729" style="s2">is totally obsessed with this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.650" end="00:04:04.629" style="s2">obsessed with this dark this very this</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.729" end="00:04:07.719" style="s2">thing that this this dark feature of of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.629" end="00:04:10.659" style="s2">the human experience which which we</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.719" end="00:04:14.139" style="s2">absolutely have to control we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.659" end="00:04:17.739" style="s2">we can&#39;t let it control us we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.139" end="00:04:21.099" style="s2">have to rein it in and and contain it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.739" end="00:04:25.090" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t it controls us and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.099" end="00:04:26.710" style="s2">controlling force is a recurring for</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.090" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">Rene Girard as a recurring force of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.710" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">collective murder record a recurring</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">pattern of collective murder</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:36.860" style="s2">mostly featured in deep prehistory</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:40.580" style="s2">progressively diminishing as history</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.860" end="00:04:42.860" style="s2">advances so there&#39;s a a slow process of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.580" end="00:04:45.139" style="s2">becoming aware of this and he says the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.860" end="00:04:48.530" style="s2">Bible is what Bibles does this better</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.139" end="00:04:51.289" style="s2">than any other cultural focus so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.530" end="00:04:53.719" style="s2">that&#39;s the story of human sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.289" end="00:04:57.439" style="s2">correct which means which means a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.719" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">of people gathering around the weakest</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.439" end="00:05:04.009" style="s2">most innocent person and making them</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">redundant blaming them for for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.009" end="00:05:09.949" style="s2">happened or because they&#39;re weak or and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">can&#39;t keep the tribe going or first of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.949" end="00:05:14.389" style="s2">all human sacrifice is a big fat lie the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:18.409" style="s2">word the whole term human sacrifice is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.389" end="00:05:22.849" style="s2">is a term that&#39;s used it&#39;s an older term</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.409" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">and it it refers to a it represents</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.849" end="00:05:26.719" style="s2">something that is not understood but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:30.169" style="s2">where is the observation that a human is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.719" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">being killed by by a group and so and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.169" end="00:05:35.080" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s since it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.479" end="00:05:38.259" style="s2">coded in in elements of religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.080" end="00:05:40.490" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s called human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.259" end="00:05:46.009" style="s2">Rene Girard points out that this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.490" end="00:05:49.819" style="s2">actually a deeply entrenched cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.009" end="00:05:51.979" style="s2">mechanism of a culture lying to itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.819" end="00:05:55.159" style="s2">about what&#39;s actually happening so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.979" end="00:05:58.009" style="s2">there&#39;s this he he basically says that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.159" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">culture is founded on a the dark</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.009" end="00:06:03.620" style="s2">recurring moment of cultural murder in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:06.050" style="s2">collective murder in which we lie about</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.620" end="00:06:09.169" style="s2">what happened so here&#39;s here&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.050" end="00:06:13.310" style="s2">he says that we we are very imitative</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.169" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">animals we we engage in where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.310" end="00:06:18.529" style="s2">completely pretty supposed to imitate</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">each other but this is many ways totally</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.529" end="00:06:24.289" style="s2">irrational in some way it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:26.120" style="s2">synonym of desire and in a sense as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.289" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">result it&#39;s an illusion of desire at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:30.979" style="s2">same time it&#39;s just simply imitating</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:33.080" style="s2">another is is what he seems to be saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.979" end="00:06:35.060" style="s2">desire is i I don&#39;t like the way he I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.080" end="00:06:38.599" style="s2">think I have a problem with with his</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.060" end="00:06:40.789" style="s2">definition of desire but nonetheless see</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.599" end="00:06:43.310" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about this great force of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.789" end="00:06:45.259" style="s2">imitation and what happens is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.310" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">imitates another and then another</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.259" end="00:06:49.610" style="s2">imitates and then what you have is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:50.680" style="s2">this whole group imitating the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.610" end="00:06:52.840" style="s2">pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.680" end="00:06:54.550" style="s2">there tends to be a rivalry with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.840" end="00:06:56.830" style="s2">that&#39;s probably what why the term desire</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.550" end="00:06:58.870" style="s2">matters for sure are because what</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.830" end="00:07:01.570" style="s2">happens is one tries to outdo the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.870" end="00:07:04.150" style="s2">in him in imitating the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.570" end="00:07:06.100" style="s2">pattern of imitative behavior and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:08.740" style="s2">you have is this snowballing effect of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.100" end="00:07:11.139" style="s2">collective imitation and what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.740" end="00:07:13.210" style="s2">problem the problem with that is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.139" end="00:07:15.250" style="s2">totally irrational for one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.210" end="00:07:19.449" style="s2">resolving nothing and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.250" end="00:07:22.210" style="s2">escalating into pandemonium&#39;s because</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.880" end="00:07:40.530" style="s2">it&#39;s spontaneously happened and doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.530" end="00:07:48.660" style="s2">worked is utterly mysterious but</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.590" end="00:07:54.849" style="s2">basically in that great snowballing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.660" end="00:07:58.949" style="s2">mimetic desire there would be a sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.849" end="00:08:03.220" style="s2">that things were about to erupt into</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.949" end="00:08:05.139" style="s2">uncontrolled mass violence and someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.220" end="00:08:06.909" style="s2">in the group and this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.139" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">relatively small tribal group all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.909" end="00:08:13.659" style="s2">same someone in the group would</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:17.110" style="s2">spontaneously say it&#39;s his fault or turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.659" end="00:08:20.710" style="s2">fault and it was usually someone who was</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.820" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">following it then they were the eyeballs</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.469" end="00:08:42.669" style="s2">out of the of the whole snowballing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:47.020" style="s2">process that person was spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.669" end="00:08:51.640" style="s2">accused of being the one who caused this</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.020" end="00:08:54.930" style="s2">entire pandemonium and the the group the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.640" end="00:08:59.110" style="s2">collective group would in turn all</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.930" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">spontaneously in the same wave of</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:08.120" style="s2">would agree absolutely everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.350" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">group would be wrapped up in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.120" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">imitative pattern except those who did</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">spontaneously agree to choose a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:19.310" style="s2">representative scapegoat correct and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:22.579" style="s2">was taught it was basically totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.310" end="00:09:25.430" style="s2">irrational and then they would in turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.579" end="00:09:30.230" style="s2">so that was they the accusation first</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.430" end="00:09:32.680" style="s2">came and then the the agreement the unit</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.230" end="00:09:36.459" style="s2">the unit the the unanimous agreement</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.680" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">from the entire group was the trial</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.459" end="00:09:44.180" style="s2">basically and and so the the verdict was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:46.010" style="s2">a medias and and everybody agreed in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.180" end="00:09:48.079" style="s2">other words there was a judge and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.010" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">was the accuser and then there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.079" end="00:09:52.699" style="s2">jury who all immediately immediately</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:54.529" style="s2">agreed and I&#39;m only saying this Roni</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.699" end="00:09:56.690" style="s2">we&#39;re only superimposing a much later a</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.470" end="00:10:05.149" style="s2">and then they would in turn kill the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:06.589" style="s2">person they will get just a question how</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.149" end="00:10:08.649" style="s2">is that different from how animals</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.589" end="00:10:12.019" style="s2">behave like an animal you know animals</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.649" end="00:10:14.329" style="s2">animals no animal animal might might get</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.019" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">rid of the weakest person right or you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.329" end="00:10:20.630" style="s2">know because the weakest person might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.339" style="s2">a drain on the resources of the I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.630" end="00:10:23.990" style="s2">like get rid of the weakest now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.339" end="00:10:25.430" style="s2">know if that&#39;s the case that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.990" end="00:10:26.899" style="s2">always are unique and practicing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.430" end="00:10:29.300" style="s2">within this particular practice I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.899" end="00:10:31.399" style="s2">think it&#39;s a unique are they unique in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.300" end="00:10:33.709" style="s2">their scale or are they actually unique</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.399" end="00:10:37.670" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.709" end="00:10:40.730" style="s2">mean the question but I have heard that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.670" end="00:10:42.199" style="s2">humans are unique in this I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.730" end="00:10:43.959" style="s2">know whether other animals practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.199" end="00:10:47.060" style="s2">bizarre things where members are the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.959" end="00:10:48.319" style="s2">members of the the group they kill a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.060" end="00:10:50.449" style="s2">single member of the group gets killed</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.319" end="00:10:52.069" style="s2">by by the entire group I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.449" end="00:10:54.170" style="s2">that&#39;s I think what&#39;s unique about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.069" end="00:10:56.089" style="s2">humans is they represent they use they</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.170" end="00:10:57.529" style="s2">have representative they have adults</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.089" end="00:10:59.569" style="s2">they make representations</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.529" end="00:11:02.329" style="s2">that&#39;s what okay that&#39;s what you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.569" end="00:11:03.410" style="s2">about our brain and for your answer well</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.329" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">I I haven&#39;t got that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.410" end="00:11:06.829" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first so that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:09.199" style="s2">gotten to that part I&#39;m getting there so</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.829" end="00:11:11.540" style="s2">again that&#39;s that&#39;s the first prime so</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.199" end="00:11:14.810" style="s2">the so the group the tribe the group has</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.540" end="00:11:20.150" style="s2">just killed someone killed a scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.810" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">and what happens in that moment is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.150" end="00:11:28.010" style="s2">whole group comes down and so the and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:30.110" style="s2">and how and why this this calming occurs</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.010" end="00:11:33.400" style="s2">because someone was just killed by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.110" end="00:11:36.440" style="s2">is utterly strange and mysterious but</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.400" end="00:11:37.790" style="s2">nonetheless this is what happened it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.440" end="00:11:39.620" style="s2">happened over and over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:42.650" style="s2">again and so the the act of killing</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.620" end="00:11:47.590" style="s2">someone accused of the the uncontrolled</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.650" end="00:11:50.840" style="s2">mimetic patterns was was a a deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.590" end="00:11:54.170" style="s2">unconscious mechanism which succeeded in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.840" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">in calming down the entire tribe they</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.170" end="00:12:00.500" style="s2">would they would all stop and and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:12:03.140" style="s2">and for a time the rivalry and the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.500" end="00:12:06.890" style="s2">mimetic snowballing had would disappear</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.140" end="00:12:10.330" style="s2">completely and and so a temporary peace</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.890" end="00:12:18.700" style="s2">would would reign over the group and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.330" end="00:12:23.710" style="s2">this discovery became what it became</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.700" end="00:12:27.890" style="s2">something that was worshipped what they</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.710" end="00:12:31.220" style="s2">Girard theorizes that what they what</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.890" end="00:12:33.380" style="s2">they did was they would credit they</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.220" end="00:12:36.860" style="s2">would they began to deify</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.380" end="00:12:39.110" style="s2">the person who was just killed because</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.860" end="00:12:41.510" style="s2">the person had brought peace to the to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.110" end="00:12:46.310" style="s2">the tribe and so in other words it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.510" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">meant to be and and so what they</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.310" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2">actually what in turn actually happened</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">was they would then in turn worship the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:12:59.420" style="s2">person who had just killed as a God</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:13:02.510" style="s2">because that person would what had</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:04.940" style="s2">brought peace upon the the tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.510" end="00:13:06.260" style="s2">they would do this for a time they would</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.940" end="00:13:10.250" style="s2">they would continue to they would do</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.260" end="00:13:11.810" style="s2">this for a time until until the until</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.250" end="00:13:13.520" style="s2">the that particular God had faded from</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.810" end="00:13:14.060" style="s2">memory essentially which you know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.520" end="00:13:16.910" style="s2">might happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.060" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean you can imagine I can only</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.910" end="00:13:22.490" style="s2">imagine how long that would be and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:25.070" style="s2">however this cycle of mementos ISM would</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:26.570" style="s2">return and and at another snowballing</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.070" end="00:13:27.880" style="s2">and it would usually involve a different</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.570" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.880" end="00:13:32.620" style="s2">you know the last time there were who</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:35.410" style="s2">knows maybe they were talking they were</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.620" end="00:13:38.199" style="s2">they were discussing rocks and so they</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.410" end="00:13:40.509" style="s2">would they would the next thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.199" end="00:13:43.500" style="s2">having a fight about rocks and and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.509" end="00:13:45.880" style="s2">it would escalate into this grand tribal</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.500" end="00:13:47.380" style="s2">crazy pandemonium about rocks and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.880" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">they killed someone and then they would</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.490" end="00:13:59.639" style="s2">somehow would be associated with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.329" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">snowballs and spins out of control</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.889" end="00:15:16.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what he means when the Metis ISM</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:18.550" style="s2">and and so basically this was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.410" end="00:15:19.930" style="s2">extremely long process with which he</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.550" end="00:15:22.930" style="s2">speculates may have been hundreds of</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:32.199" style="s2">and and and and the worshipping of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:34.029" style="s2">person killed involved a an investment</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.199" end="00:15:37.649" style="s2">of language would it would involve a</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.890" end="00:16:00.730" style="s2">means that so you have to you have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.630" end="00:16:02.410" style="s2">innocent victim that then you and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.730" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">whole tribe is brought into this frenzy</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.410" end="00:16:06.190" style="s2">and they kill the innocent victim and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">then there&#39;s a period a period of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.190" end="00:16:10.270" style="s2">appeasement because they&#39;ve they&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.870" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">the sacrifice which lasts for a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.270" end="00:16:13.840" style="s2">time until the tension builds up again</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:15.790" style="s2">and again and and there&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.840" end="00:16:17.890" style="s2">issue and then and then they find</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.790" end="00:16:20.500" style="s2">another victim and each time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.890" end="00:16:21.520" style="s2">there creating the story of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.500" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">in the sentences okay you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.520" end="00:16:23.950" style="s2">you&#39;re getting most of it but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:27.670" style="s2">trying to get at here is the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.950" end="00:16:30.040" style="s2">language yeah the story with each with</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.670" end="00:16:32.170" style="s2">each it seems to me that they may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.040" end="00:16:33.970" style="s2">maybe the persons killed had names or</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">something or a but they there would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.970" end="00:16:39.400" style="s2">an audience you know going way back in</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:41.530" style="s2">time it might be and so at first the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.400" end="00:16:43.570" style="s2">person killed will be no but then later</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.530" end="00:16:47.790" style="s2">they were they they began to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.570" end="00:16:50.830" style="s2">from it and then they were Bertha and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.790" end="00:16:53.860" style="s2">each person killed would have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.830" end="00:16:55.900" style="s2">distinguishing sound and over time these</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.860" end="00:16:58.090" style="s2">these this would develop they would</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.900" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">bring together different sounds and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.090" end="00:17:04.450" style="s2">it would become big and bad and bored</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2">and rock and rock and skis sky and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.450" end="00:17:08.230" style="s2">associated with whatever they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.850" end="00:17:08.620" style="s2">imitating whatever they were fighting</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.230" end="00:17:11.100" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.620" end="00:17:13.900" style="s2">so whatever they were pointing to and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.100" end="00:17:16.210" style="s2">competing over would then be invested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.900" end="00:17:18.310" style="s2">in a in a certain sound which he</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.210" end="00:17:20.830" style="s2">eventually became the syllabic sub</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.310" end="00:17:23.620" style="s2">structure of our language basically I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.830" end="00:17:26.380" style="s2">think Gerard Lee thinks that which is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.620" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">damn radical bloody theory it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.380" end="00:17:33.130" style="s2">major gotten up there and so each part</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">of our language is as a result I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.130" end="00:17:36.610" style="s2">sure if I&#39;m getting it some of his</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:39.250" style="s2">escape he thinks our linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.610" end="00:17:43.630" style="s2">substructure substrata is basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.250" end="00:17:47.260" style="s2">composed as a bait ISM is a deep muddy</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.630" end="00:17:50.490" style="s2">compost of murders</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.260" end="00:17:53.860" style="s2">uh-huh each and every one of them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.490" end="00:17:55.419" style="s2">and and we started to create compound we</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.860" end="00:17:57.040" style="s2">became creative with it once once the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.419" end="00:18:00.850" style="s2">compost was there we could do stuff with</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.040" end="00:18:03.429" style="s2">it and and and and that became you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.850" end="00:18:05.169" style="s2">that we started to develop other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.429" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">doing things but basically there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.169" end="00:18:10.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a little and the thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">they would kill someone and then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.150" end="00:18:13.150" style="s2">would de Fi that person saying this was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:14.740" style="s2">meant to be and they would dare fire the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.150" end="00:18:18.940" style="s2">person killed but it was all a big fat</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.740" end="00:18:21.309" style="s2">lie all it was was a murderous just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.940" end="00:18:23.290" style="s2">murder and it did and it happened to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.309" end="00:18:27.340" style="s2">resolve it happened to calm people down</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.290" end="00:18:30.460" style="s2">and so in other words our syllabic</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.340" end="00:18:32.290" style="s2">substructure the substrata of human</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.460" end="00:18:33.880" style="s2">language and this is every tribe without</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.290" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">exception says Gerard all around the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.880" end="00:18:38.950" style="s2">world the the substrata of human</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">language is based on is based on one</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">Nagas after another of human hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">basically each and every each and every</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:50.290" style="s2">syllable is born from a hypocritical</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:51.880" style="s2">moment in which the whole tribe killed</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.290" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">someone and then lied to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.880" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">about what really happened very dark</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:59.590" style="s2">theory yeah that&#39;s dark for sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.220" end="00:19:03.870" style="s2">what he also says and in other words</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.590" end="00:19:07.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep sense of blame</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.870" end="00:19:11.370" style="s2">an extremely profound sense of blame</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.740" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">rooted in our but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.370" end="00:19:16.780" style="s2">concealment of there&#39;s also an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:18.730" style="s2">of peace or something like that and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.780" end="00:19:21.669" style="s2">not only that this this affects our</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.730" end="00:19:23.669" style="s2">sense of other tribes of other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.669" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">because we had this immediate sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.669" end="00:19:28.120" style="s2">we we don&#39;t see it in ourselves what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:30.850" style="s2">see to them that they they&#39;re a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.120" end="00:19:33.160" style="s2">violent savages we can see we sense the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.850" end="00:19:34.390" style="s2">we sense the the hypocrisy in their</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.160" end="00:19:37.540" style="s2">language and stuff but we don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.390" end="00:19:39.460" style="s2">in ourselves we see it in them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.540" end="00:19:40.780" style="s2">easier to see the other side it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.460" end="00:19:43.210" style="s2">to see the apocrypha right the way you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.780" end="00:19:47.290" style="s2">don&#39;t see your own back yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">and and so basically I think this theory</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.290" end="00:19:52.900" style="s2">it just explains everything now Gerard</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2">is a Christian he&#39;s believes in God and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.900" end="00:20:01.030" style="s2">and and the reason he is this and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:02.590" style="s2">he&#39;s also claims that the Jewish Bible</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.030" end="00:20:05.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a full account although in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.590" end="00:20:07.450" style="s2">disparate form its spread out in in bits</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.800" end="00:20:08.350" style="s2">and pieces in different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.450" end="00:20:13.000" style="s2">Bible you have to piece it together</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.350" end="00:20:16.840" style="s2">yourself just to show how the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.000" end="00:20:18.750" style="s2">Bible explains it actually has a full</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.840" end="00:20:21.850" style="s2">explanation for this he says the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.750" end="00:20:24.540" style="s2">Christian Testament has a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.850" end="00:20:27.040" style="s2">concentrated more explicit in your face</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.540" end="00:20:29.110" style="s2">totally in your face explanation</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.040" end="00:20:31.780" style="s2">especially in the Gospels of of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.110" end="00:20:33.640" style="s2">particular occurrence okay and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.780" end="00:20:37.930" style="s2">already there and Cain and Abel and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.640" end="00:20:42.280" style="s2">Abraham and Joel come into fruition</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.930" end="00:20:44.890" style="s2">until I mean it&#39;s most obvious the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.280" end="00:20:47.650" style="s2">obvious sacrifices is of Jesus right</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.890" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s its most obviously in the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.650" end="00:20:52.390" style="s2">Testament in the Book of Isaiah and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:54.670" style="s2">gives about 10 or 20 citations to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.390" end="00:20:56.650" style="s2">first looked at in Isaiah it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.670" end="00:20:57.940" style="s2">quite shocked it&#39;s quite amazing what</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.650" end="00:21:01.210" style="s2">what I said what&#39;s it says in Isaiah</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.940" end="00:21:03.670" style="s2">about about the killing of innocents and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.210" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">how they&#39;re used escape boats and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.670" end="00:21:08.500" style="s2">all this comes tough his point is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:11.020" style="s2">is deeply unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.500" end="00:21:14.470" style="s2">that&#39;s Gerard&#39;s point it is so</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.020" end="00:21:17.050" style="s2">unconscious that it is even though it</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.470" end="00:21:20.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t expressed in a totally explicit</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.050" end="00:21:22.750" style="s2">form he see he illustrates that it is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.140" end="00:21:25.270" style="s2">is very explicit</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.750" end="00:21:28.060" style="s2">it&#39;s very explicitly stated in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.270" end="00:21:31.570" style="s2">Gospels it has only been transformed</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.060" end="00:21:31.990" style="s2">into a rational theory in the 20th</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.779" end="00:29:10.850" style="s2">cycle that&#39;s what the Bible is basically</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.850" end="00:29:15.769" style="s2">and yoga and all these other wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.279" end="00:29:32.750" style="s2">over and over again you know like</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.750" end="00:29:41.450" style="s2">thinking oh why it seems they&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.139" end="00:29:43.820" style="s2">same subject it&#39;s like hypocrisy and and</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.820" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">sort of moralism on the surface and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.010" end="00:29:50.899" style="s2">below the surface there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">human sacrifice going on yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.899" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">good question the sexuality is one of</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.919" end="00:30:12.500" style="s2">it is this subject that has had the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.070" end="00:30:14.630" style="s2">the most mimetic concentration around it</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.500" end="00:30:18.049" style="s2">so in other words it is the subject that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.630" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">has led to the most collected murders in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.049" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">in the past and that&#39;s that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:25.880" style="s2">why it&#39;s totally charged the search for</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:28.490" style="s2">innocence is is basically here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:31.389" style="s2">here&#39;s this is my most general</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.490" end="00:30:37.309" style="s2">presentation of the Bible the Bible a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.389" end="00:30:40.580" style="s2">inhabits a larger metaphor which is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.309" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">trial and we&#39;re on trial and God is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.580" end="00:30:47.000" style="s2">judge and the question is the simple</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:53.029" style="s2">question is this this is the trial are</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.000" end="00:30:55.820" style="s2">we innocent or are we guilty and that to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.029" end="00:30:58.220" style="s2">me is the the best way well the best way</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.820" end="00:31:03.019" style="s2">for me in any case to frame the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.220" end="00:31:05.720" style="s2">to see it in that very strong basic</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.019" end="00:31:07.190" style="s2">moral question are we innocent or are we</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.720" end="00:31:08.450" style="s2">guilty now of course the answer that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.190" end="00:31:10.130" style="s2">question is always contextual</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.450" end="00:31:11.930" style="s2">it&#39;s always get in every single context</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.130" end="00:31:13.700" style="s2">in which we which were in and we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.930" end="00:31:15.680" style="s2">identify I think with every decision we</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.700" end="00:31:18.290" style="s2">make we can identify innocence and guilt</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.680" end="00:31:19.970" style="s2">and this becomes this becomes this very</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.290" end="00:31:21.980" style="s2">difficult process and we look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.970" end="00:31:24.470" style="s2">details and we we still identify</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.980" end="00:31:26.540" style="s2">identify at least every in many</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.470" end="00:31:28.400" style="s2">decisions I make identify guilt identify</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.540" end="00:31:30.650" style="s2">that there&#39;s a degree of wrongness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.400" end="00:31:35.300" style="s2">thus is degree of rightness well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.650" end="00:31:40.760" style="s2">it may be a ignorant and or ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.300" end="00:31:43.790" style="s2">and understanding whether oh yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.760" end="00:31:46.760" style="s2">I totally agree with you that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.790" end="00:31:49.100" style="s2">process of learning absolutely we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.760" end="00:31:53.450" style="s2">digging it up from the unconscious but</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.100" end="00:31:58.340" style="s2">the Bible at least Gerard&#39;s Bible says</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.450" end="00:32:03.190" style="s2">that we are that that the the the main</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.340" end="00:32:07.400" style="s2">source of our guilt is the deflecting of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.190" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">onto a scapegoat and and how it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.400" end="00:32:10.850" style="s2">basically has created a totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:14.140" style="s2">delusional sense of reality that&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.850" end="00:32:16.580" style="s2">an important idea isn&#39;t it so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.140" end="00:32:19.160" style="s2">basically all of our language all of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.580" end="00:32:24.500" style="s2">language is ultimately illusioned now we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.160" end="00:32:25.820" style="s2">are engaged in a process of of sorting</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.500" end="00:32:29.900" style="s2">it out so that it becomes progressively</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.820" end="00:32:31.250" style="s2">less illusory and and I would you ask me</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.900" end="00:32:35.300" style="s2">about modernity I would say modernity is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.250" end="00:32:37.100" style="s2">part and parcel of that process this the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.300" end="00:32:40.270" style="s2">drought I would not come Gerrard is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.100" end="00:32:42.740" style="s2">a modern thinker he&#39;s he is what people</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.270" end="00:32:45.590" style="s2">he he I think he calls himself a non</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.740" end="00:32:47.570" style="s2">structuralist thinker and non</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.590" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">structuralism is for me the proper name</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.570" end="00:32:52.370" style="s2">for what I think is a misnomer which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:56.090" style="s2">what people most people call</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.370" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">post-modernism in my opinion in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.090" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">opinion anybody uses the term</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.610" style="s2">post-modernism or post structuralism it</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:03.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand what they mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.610" end="00:33:04.970" style="s2">it means it&#39;s a it&#39;s an immediate</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.620" end="00:33:07.700" style="s2">indication that they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.970" end="00:33:08.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not structuralism means that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.700" end="00:33:11.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a principle which permeates</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.900" end="00:33:13.400" style="s2">every single every single category and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.660" end="00:33:15.500" style="s2">every single joinery of structure and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.400" end="00:33:17.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the same principle so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.500" end="00:33:21.320" style="s2">principle of sameness Girard has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.960" end="00:33:23.270" style="s2">to say about sameness and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.320" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">there&#39;s this same there&#39;s in may there</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.270" end="00:33:26.510" style="s2">may not be just one Prince well there</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:28.520" style="s2">might be many principals but all in all</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.510" end="00:33:30.800" style="s2">the the many nurses own is a corollary</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.520" end="00:33:33.530" style="s2">of the one principle which is related to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.800" end="00:33:35.630" style="s2">this whole issue of scapegoating and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.530" end="00:33:37.520" style="s2">negation of scapegoating we history is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.630" end="00:33:39.290" style="s2">the process of or at least</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.520" end="00:33:42.800" style="s2">judeo-christian history is the process</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.290" end="00:33:46.190" style="s2">of turning that on its head and and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.800" end="00:33:49.100" style="s2">defending the falsely accused the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.190" end="00:33:52.670" style="s2">when we do that to defend the falsely</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.100" end="00:33:55.730" style="s2">accused is to look at this subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.670" end="00:33:58.520" style="s2">this this great infinitely complex array</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.170" end="00:34:19.070" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s all based on just layers and</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.910" end="00:37:31.720" style="s2">and draw brings up this point we are</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.890" end="00:37:55.460" style="s2">the reason why is warframe is not is</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.210" end="00:37:56.750" style="s2">because he&#39;s he was a biblical thinker</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.540" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">it&#39;s sad and pathetic and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.210" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">reason for this in Giraud was angry</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:09.320" style="s2">about this is because we are so a meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:12.290" style="s2">sized mimetic we were meta sized to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.320" end="00:38:14.150" style="s2">shown biblical scholarship in the mid</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.290" end="00:38:16.940" style="s2">20th century it was considered not to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.150" end="00:38:18.680" style="s2">intelligent so we are our whole sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.940" end="00:38:20.900" style="s2">intellectual culture he points out is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.680" end="00:38:23.390" style="s2">extremely Metis eyes it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.900" end="00:38:24.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.390" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">all it&#39;s not looking in the right places</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.620" end="00:38:29.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s too busy making false</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:30.950" style="s2">accusations off or off over in some some</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.480" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">other corner of whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.950" end="00:38:35.390" style="s2">instead of actually you know identifying</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:36.260" style="s2">the obvious problem and so this happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.390" end="00:38:38.230" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.260" end="00:38:41.410" style="s2">the next stage of this would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.230" end="00:38:43.700" style="s2">explaining you know the negative side of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.410" end="00:38:46.610" style="s2">victimology it&#39;s like gone the other way</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.700" end="00:38:49.850" style="s2">right yeah people are people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.610" end="00:38:53.030" style="s2">starting to think that people are taking</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.850" end="00:38:56.590" style="s2">that on as they are the innocent victim</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.030" end="00:38:58.610" style="s2">you know to extreme extense right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.590" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">well just before you know and I I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.610" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">thought I thought of one before I talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:05.180" style="s2">about that I thought about what I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:06.770" style="s2">to say Jerrod had made this statement</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.180" end="00:39:08.510" style="s2">which I believe one day will be a very</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.510" end="00:39:23.960" style="s2">and also in literature you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:25.310" style="s2">you or not to be that was the question</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.960" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a few really</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.310" end="00:39:36.290" style="s2">famous phrases that they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:40.910" style="s2">anywhere and Gerard said this he said we</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.290" end="00:39:45.530" style="s2">did not stop burning witches because</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.910" end="00:39:48.110" style="s2">science was invented rather science was</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.410" end="00:40:05.600" style="s2">identifies he there&#39;s this great sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.130" end="00:40:08.540" style="s2">in in Western intellectual history that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.600" end="00:40:11.000" style="s2">we were mired in the delusions the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.540" end="00:40:13.220" style="s2">stupid delusions of religion and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.000" end="00:40:15.350" style="s2">Along Came science and showed us how</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.220" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">delusional religion was and now we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.350" end="00:40:18.830" style="s2">sort of her minds are clarifying and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:21.620" style="s2">things were getting better and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.830" end="00:40:23.630" style="s2">the light what happened and thank God</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.620" end="00:40:26.300" style="s2">we&#39;re out of that mire irreligious whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.630" end="00:40:27.380" style="s2">and dresses you foolish foolish dummies</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.300" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not at all what</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.380" end="00:40:32.420" style="s2">happened what happened was we were it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:33.770" style="s2">took us friggin fifteen hundred years to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.420" end="00:40:36.050" style="s2">or fourteen hundred years to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.770" end="00:40:37.610" style="s2">that burning witches was was bad and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.050" end="00:40:40.700" style="s2">this is here&#39;s an interesting take on</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.610" end="00:40:41.990" style="s2">witch burnings of the Middle Ages witch</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.700" end="00:40:45.140" style="s2">burnings happen in the Middle Ages and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.990" end="00:40:48.770" style="s2">we look at witch burnings as being a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.140" end="00:40:51.080" style="s2">regrettable as a dark period of Western</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.770" end="00:40:52.970" style="s2">European history because we were burning</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:55.580" style="s2">witches for compounder years or</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.970" end="00:40:57.650" style="s2">something like that here&#39;s what really</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.580" end="00:40:59.990" style="s2">happened and it did happen and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.650" end="00:41:02.600" style="s2">it was something dark and terrible but</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.990" end="00:41:04.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not what happened we we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.600" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">doing something similar to that all</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.670" end="00:41:08.840" style="s2">along we were there was there were you</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:10.790" style="s2">know in the time of Jesus there were</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.840" end="00:41:12.890" style="s2">crucifixions that was very common there</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.790" end="00:41:14.540" style="s2">are other forms of lynchings go</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.890" end="00:41:16.850" style="s2">happening right up through the Dark Ages</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.540" end="00:41:18.650" style="s2">but what happened with them burning with</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.850" end="00:41:21.170" style="s2">the witch burnings and I didn&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.650" end="00:41:23.590" style="s2">this up I didn&#39;t stress this enough when</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.170" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">I talked about collective murder the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.590" end="00:41:29.600" style="s2">trial the condemnation of the accused</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:31.460" style="s2">person is always unanimous in the trial</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.600" end="00:41:34.760" style="s2">going back in prehistory you know with</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.460" end="00:41:38.090" style="s2">the witch burnings there were people in</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.760" end="00:41:40.370" style="s2">the crowd who disagreed with what was</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.090" end="00:41:42.140" style="s2">happening uh-huh and that I&#39;m that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.370" end="00:41:44.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen before that did not happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.140" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">before it was unanimous that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.600" end="00:41:48.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t in Israel I was wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">the guillotines because I know it in</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.490" end="00:42:06.820" style="s2">because there were so many so many</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.080" end="00:42:08.980" style="s2">guillotines going along it&#39;s a bit noisy</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.820" end="00:42:10.990" style="s2">but and then the crowds were all getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.980" end="00:42:13.300" style="s2">you know it would come out and watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.990" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">this and it would be you know Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.300" end="00:42:17.620" style="s2">entertainment or yeah it&#39;s just crazy</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:21.310" style="s2">just nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.620" end="00:42:24.430" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.310" end="00:42:26.440" style="s2">disturbing you think about it but the we</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.430" end="00:42:27.610" style="s2">know that that was wrong and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.440" end="00:42:29.410" style="s2">reason why we know that that was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.610" end="00:42:32.100" style="s2">is because there were people in the in</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.410" end="00:42:34.390" style="s2">the at the event who knew it was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.100" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">well what they&#39;re always people that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.390" end="00:42:37.660" style="s2">would would know something like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:40.090" style="s2">would be wrong I mean no going back in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.660" end="00:42:42.430" style="s2">time no going back in time Giraud makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.090" end="00:42:46.330" style="s2">the points that the the the guilty</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.430" end="00:42:49.360" style="s2">verdict was unanimous and the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.330" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">movement away from the unanimity of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.360" end="00:42:56.650" style="s2">guilty verdict it was very slow and his</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">act required required nothing less than</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.650" end="00:43:01.840" style="s2">divine intervention is that because</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:03.730" style="s2">people were just one collective mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.840" end="00:43:07.630" style="s2">they hadn&#39;t individuated yet they hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.730" end="00:43:11.080" style="s2">become that would be one way think from</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.630" end="00:43:13.120" style="s2">themselves or or definition of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.080" end="00:43:15.190" style="s2">individuation yeah this is one source of</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.120" end="00:43:18.100" style="s2">individuation for sure i agree i would</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.190" end="00:43:19.750" style="s2">think i mean but the whole idealism what</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.100" end="00:43:23.860" style="s2">the greeks get on with there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.750" end="00:43:25.840" style="s2">i think i think well this week we get it</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.860" end="00:43:27.460" style="s2">gets murkier here now this could be my</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.840" end="00:43:31.930" style="s2">argument gets really difficult here now</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.460" end="00:43:33.970" style="s2">but you know nietzsche talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.930" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">master and slave morality sites or I</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.970" end="00:43:37.720" style="s2">think Nietzsche&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:38.740" style="s2">it&#39;s funny when when I whenever I heard</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.720" end="00:43:40.180" style="s2">people talking about Nietzsche I never</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.740" end="00:43:42.580" style="s2">hear them talk much about the slave and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.180" end="00:43:44.470" style="s2">master masters that to me is Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.580" end="00:43:46.300" style="s2">great they talk about all kinds of other</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.470" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">stuff he&#39;s talked about I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.300" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">will to power or something the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:55.420" style="s2">master and slave his recognition of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:43:57.610" style="s2">master and slave and how they evolved</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.420" end="00:43:58.780" style="s2">and how we&#39;re at a period of history</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.610" end="00:44:00.100" style="s2">where they&#39;re coming together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.780" end="00:44:02.920" style="s2">that would that was Nietzsche&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.100" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">theory that the Masters they&#39;ve evolved</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.920" end="00:44:07.270" style="s2">as separate culture separate morality</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.460" style="s2">separate culture separate long each</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.270" end="00:44:11.620" style="s2">other as distinct from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.460" end="00:44:13.270" style="s2">this went on for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.620" end="00:44:14.690" style="s2">this is basically prehistory developing</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.270" end="00:44:17.990" style="s2">this and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.690" end="00:44:19.640" style="s2">basically as presciently in the top I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.990" end="00:44:23.330" style="s2">of Nietzsche they were coming together</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.640" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">and and this was a problem this</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.330" end="00:44:28.670" style="s2">Nietzsche saw Nietzsche saw many</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:30.440" style="s2">problems with this and but also</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.670" end="00:44:31.910" style="s2">recognized that that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.440" end="00:44:33.890" style="s2">was going on that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.910" end="00:44:36.890" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s that seems to me is great</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.890" end="00:44:38.330" style="s2">theoretical import all the other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.890" end="00:44:41.090" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about is extraneous to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.330" end="00:44:43.340" style="s2">particular insight well it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.090" end="00:44:45.950" style="s2">same insight as God is dead isn&#39;t it I</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.340" end="00:44:47.810" style="s2">mean it yeah there&#39;s nobody above you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.950" end="00:44:51.290" style="s2">and nobody you know anymore it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.810" end="00:44:53.150" style="s2">people are leveling out so so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.290" end="00:44:56.090" style="s2">think of we don&#39;t think of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.150" end="00:44:58.130" style="s2">as having a higher their being higher</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.090" end="00:45:00.350" style="s2">human beings than other human beings you</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.130" end="00:45:03.910" style="s2">know they&#39;re just richer or poorer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.350" end="00:45:06.200" style="s2">yeah yeah something like that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.910" end="00:45:09.350" style="s2">anyway why didn&#39;t I think of me shit</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.200" end="00:45:14.980" style="s2">oh yes so the master and the slave I</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.350" end="00:45:16.910" style="s2">think the Plato and Aristotle they and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.980" end="00:45:19.940" style="s2">ancient Greek philosophy an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.910" end="00:45:24.680" style="s2">Greek culture period what has survived</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.940" end="00:45:26.840" style="s2">to to to enrich us is derivative of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.680" end="00:45:29.450" style="s2">master culture and so they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.840" end="00:45:35.330" style="s2">articulating a and they were clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.450" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">and working on and making and basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.330" end="00:45:39.320" style="s2">master language which was derivative of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:40.760" style="s2">master culture and they were creating</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.320" end="00:45:42.350" style="s2">philosophy out of that in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.760" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">reality and view of the universe and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.350" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">of that all through the eyes of master</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">culture while Judaism is right down in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:52.520" style="s2">the muck of slave culture and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">articulating it still has a master</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.520" end="00:45:57.320" style="s2">dimension but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:59.390" style="s2">working on this scapegoat thing this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.320" end="00:46:02.930" style="s2">working on this deep dark origin of</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.390" end="00:46:04.820" style="s2">culture which and it&#39;s deeply rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.930" end="00:46:08.300" style="s2">what was about freeing the people isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.820" end="00:46:10.700" style="s2">it and funny and it&#39;s but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.300" end="00:46:12.620" style="s2">wrote it right down in the it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.700" end="00:46:16.010" style="s2">down in the bottom of the right in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.620" end="00:46:17.750" style="s2">bedrock of culture well you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.010" end="00:46:18.950" style="s2">something about the Greeks which is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.750" end="00:46:20.750" style="s2">you know they&#39;re up in the sky there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.950" end="00:46:22.430" style="s2">their gods you know they&#39;re there did</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.750" end="00:46:26.540" style="s2">their different different altogether</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.430" end="00:46:27.860" style="s2">there so that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.540" end="00:46:29.480" style="s2">thing about</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.860" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">the Jewish important what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.480" end="00:46:32.660" style="s2">talking about here is Judaism although</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:34.310" style="s2">and you&#39;re talking about it through the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:35.690" style="s2">eyes of the Gospels through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.310" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">the Gospels mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.690" end="00:46:39.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve recently kind of developed an</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:40.940" style="s2">elaborate theory of anti-semitism which</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.830" end="00:46:46.250" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of proud of but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.940" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">cut right down to the simple part about</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.250" end="00:46:50.990" style="s2">that yeah it&#39;s well maybe I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:51.410" style="s2">simplify let&#39;s go through it very</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.990" end="00:46:53.840" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.410" end="00:46:56.990" style="s2">Thomas draw Sol talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.840" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">middleman we we&#39;ve come to see Jews as</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.990" end="00:47:04.490" style="s2">associated with money and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:05.390" style="s2">and all things all things you know good</p>

<p begin="00:47:05.390" end="00:47:12.620" style="s2">the this is a latter-day cultural</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.950" end="00:47:14.630" style="s2">development and I think it&#39;s a result of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.620" end="00:47:16.670" style="s2">the deprivation of private property that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.630" end="00:47:21.230" style="s2">the back because of Christian</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.670" end="00:47:23.450" style="s2">persecution not that I know I&#39;m not much</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.230" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">of an historian but basically what they</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.450" end="00:47:28.370" style="s2">develop was that culture the middle man</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:31.190" style="s2">now the middle man has to put in Thomas</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.190" end="00:47:36.440" style="s2">misunderstood figure it the middle</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.340" end="00:47:39.080" style="s2">manner basically is essential to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.440" end="00:47:41.570" style="s2">economics so they they buy their</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.080" end="00:47:43.490" style="s2">basically buy and sell and if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.570" end="00:47:46.970" style="s2">if there&#39;s nobody out there buying and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.490" end="00:47:49.790" style="s2">selling then you don&#39;t have a you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.970" end="00:47:53.630" style="s2">have a very functional economic economy</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.790" end="00:47:55.070" style="s2">so these people are necessary and so and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.630" end="00:47:56.810" style="s2">the middleman it&#39;s very common for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.070" end="00:47:59.090" style="s2">middleman and I mean you know in many</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.810" end="00:48:00.740" style="s2">cultures to be resented and to be blamed</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.090" end="00:48:02.810" style="s2">and to be thought that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.740" end="00:48:06.560" style="s2">whoever whoever the middleman is just</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.810" end="00:48:08.060" style="s2">cheating them of something and maybe at</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.560" end="00:48:09.940" style="s2">times they are maybe maybe at other</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.060" end="00:48:13.790" style="s2">times they&#39;re not but the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.940" end="00:48:15.170" style="s2">they&#39;re necessary so whether we like it</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.790" end="00:48:17.240" style="s2">or not they&#39;re there they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.170" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">they&#39;re there now competition between</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.240" end="00:48:21.050" style="s2">middlemen and brings down the dishonesty</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:23.600" style="s2">you get a much better deal in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.050" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">competition like in Newfoundland we had</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.600" end="00:48:29.990" style="s2">what we call the merchants economy here</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:31.610" style="s2">and merchants who this theory developed</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.990" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">nah I&#39;m starting to realize it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.610" end="00:48:36.020" style="s2">result of the onslaught of Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:40.369" style="s2">culture into into Western economic</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.020" end="00:48:42.380" style="s2">theory where we recognize the merchants</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.369" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">these terrible people who cheated out</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.380" end="00:48:49.009" style="s2">the the fisherfolk of Newfoundland and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:51.589" style="s2">think we might want to have a second</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.009" end="00:48:54.470" style="s2">look at that history I think that might</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.589" end="00:48:56.779" style="s2">be a very skewed not that it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.470" end="00:48:57.559" style="s2">there isn&#39;t some truth to it but I like</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.779" end="00:48:59.180" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.559" end="00:49:00.380" style="s2">Newfoundland folk songs and there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.180" end="00:49:02.930" style="s2">a lot there&#39;s not a lot of Newfoundland</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.380" end="00:49:04.839" style="s2">folk songs which hates the merchants it</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.930" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s a relatively recent in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.839" end="00:49:11.869" style="s2">introduction we were taught by theory it</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">seems to hate the merchants well it</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.869" end="00:49:17.509" style="s2">seems at one time we it was understood</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:19.009" style="s2">to be a just a necessary part of life it</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.509" end="00:49:21.019" style="s2">was it was it was a piece of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.009" end="00:49:22.910" style="s2">right a piece of the larger fabric and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.019" end="00:49:25.279" style="s2">that you know without which she could</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.910" end="00:49:27.950" style="s2">not survive kind of thing a bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.279" end="00:49:29.869" style="s2">king you know a king a king is both</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.950" end="00:49:33.529" style="s2">worshipped and reviled depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.869" end="00:49:37.460" style="s2">king depending on the cultures something</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.529" end="00:49:40.279" style="s2">like that the so anyway middleman and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.460" end="00:49:42.499" style="s2">middleman cultures are often persecuted</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.279" end="00:49:44.329" style="s2">and often reviled the Armenians were</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.499" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">middlemen for example they they suffered</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.329" end="00:49:49.160" style="s2">persecution the year there were other</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:50.150" style="s2">middlemen in in Eastern Africa Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.160" end="00:49:51.980" style="s2">all talks about there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.150" end="00:49:53.539" style="s2">middleman culture he mentions forget now</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.980" end="00:49:55.309" style="s2">well basically there are several</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.539" end="00:49:57.380" style="s2">cultures which are middlemen cultures</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.309" end="00:50:01.880" style="s2">which which end up being persecuted and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.380" end="00:50:03.109" style="s2">being suspected of you know cheating so</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.880" end="00:50:06.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a common thing and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.109" end="00:50:08.749" style="s2">middleman is is is a necessary piece of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.470" end="00:50:09.859" style="s2">the puzzle so you&#39;re damned if you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.749" end="00:50:12.410" style="s2">and you&#39;re damned if you don&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.859" end="00:50:13.819" style="s2">thing yeah so so that&#39;s that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.410" end="00:50:16.099" style="s2">think this is the most this is an</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.819" end="00:50:18.650" style="s2">important reason for anti-semitism but</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.099" end="00:50:21.109" style="s2">it&#39;s escaped scapegoat again and going</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.650" end="00:50:23.539" style="s2">back yeah yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.109" end="00:50:25.420" style="s2">only beginning the second reason is I</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.539" end="00:50:31.069" style="s2">think far more important than the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.420" end="00:50:32.869" style="s2">and there there&#39;s I right I I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.069" end="00:50:34.069" style="s2">in terms of three reasons the third</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.869" end="00:50:36.940" style="s2">reason is the most important the second</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.069" end="00:50:39.589" style="s2">reason has to do with the fall of Roma</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.940" end="00:50:43.039" style="s2">what happened was Rome fell and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.589" end="00:50:45.799" style="s2">basically Europe became overrun by what</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.039" end="00:50:48.349" style="s2">would I call for for both for</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.799" end="00:50:50.450" style="s2">provocation but also of seriousness the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.349" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">Catholic Taliban the Catholic Taliban</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.450" end="00:50:57.010" style="s2">basically took over</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:50:58.869" style="s2">all of Europe correct position right</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.010" end="00:51:01.029" style="s2">that&#39;s the no no you&#39;re talking the dark</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.869" end="00:51:02.760" style="s2">ages Inquisition something else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.029" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">dark ages</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.760" end="00:51:09.220" style="s2">dark ages was a time of and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:11.740" style="s2">people don&#39;t know this this is something</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.220" end="00:51:15.240" style="s2">I only learned recently shortly after</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.740" end="00:51:19.480" style="s2">the fall of Rome the Muslim world</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.240" end="00:51:21.609" style="s2">attacked and advanced and took much of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.480" end="00:51:24.069" style="s2">Christendom from from Christendom</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.609" end="00:51:27.279" style="s2">Christendom had extend it down into down</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.069" end="00:51:29.289" style="s2">into the Middle East and was a you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.279" end="00:51:33.250" style="s2">it was fairly large and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.289" end="00:51:35.980" style="s2">Muslim world began to infringe upon</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.250" end="00:51:38.680" style="s2">Christendom and it took over vast</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.980" end="00:51:42.519" style="s2">amounts of territory and this went on</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.680" end="00:51:44.109" style="s2">this this advancement continued for four</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.519" end="00:51:46.930" style="s2">hundred years I couldn&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.109" end="00:51:49.480" style="s2">yes I didn&#39;t know this but basically the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.930" end="00:51:51.700" style="s2">entire Dark Ages is characterized by war</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.480" end="00:51:55.269" style="s2">with the Muslim world and the Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.700" end="00:52:00.029" style="s2">world was the aggressor and the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.269" end="00:52:03.160" style="s2">Europe Catholic Europe was basically a a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.029" end="00:52:06.940" style="s2">it seems to me and basically a place</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.160" end="00:52:08.799" style="s2">which forever was reeling from the fall</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.940" end="00:52:12.730" style="s2">of her own in other words it was some</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.799" end="00:52:14.740" style="s2">civilizational place and because it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.730" end="00:52:16.930" style="s2">cut cut off from the power of her own</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.740" end="00:52:18.759" style="s2">sort of thing it had been isolated or</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.930" end="00:52:20.140" style="s2">well it basically didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.759" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">civilization to hold it together it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.140" end="00:52:25.059" style="s2">no longer civilization it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:28.720" style="s2">disparate I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.059" end="00:52:30.849" style="s2">it was it seems but but if in some</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.720" end="00:52:33.789" style="s2">strange way it remained a Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.849" end="00:52:35.799" style="s2">entity like a Christian entity and when</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.789" end="00:52:39.069" style="s2">despite the fact that for 400 years it</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.799" end="00:52:42.339" style="s2">was a war with Islam essentially and at</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.069" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">a certain about 400 years later 900 or</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.339" end="00:52:50.619" style="s2">something they they finally started to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:52.690" style="s2">push back the Muslim world I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.619" end="00:52:54.579" style="s2">if the Crusades have anything Crusades</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.690" end="00:52:58.289" style="s2">were later couple centuries later I</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.579" end="00:53:00.309" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they&#39;re related but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.289" end="00:53:03.400" style="s2">some people think of it as blowback but</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.309" end="00:53:05.829" style="s2">I don&#39;t know anyway well back to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.400" end="00:53:10.119" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing all the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.829" end="00:53:14.859" style="s2">catholic Taliban yeah yeah here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.119" end="00:53:18.089" style="s2">thing so the Catholic Europe is at war</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.859" end="00:53:24.549" style="s2">has basically imposed a christened &#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.089" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">over europe it&#39;s at war with with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.549" end="00:53:28.989" style="s2">muslim world but the jews aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">Christians and not only that this this</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.989" end="00:53:33.969" style="s2">Europe at the time is a theocracy it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:36.579" style="s2">there there is no separation of state</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.969" end="00:53:38.829" style="s2">religion it is it is religion that</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.579" end="00:53:40.749" style="s2">reigns and this is another theory I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.829" end="00:53:43.930" style="s2">derived from thinking about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.749" end="00:53:46.509" style="s2">when you know religion is a sub level is</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.930" end="00:53:50.200" style="s2">the self is a level below secularity</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.509" end="00:53:53.229" style="s2">it&#39;s a level below the the empty</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.200" end="00:53:55.390" style="s2">imperial realm so when the Empire Falls</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.229" end="00:53:57.880" style="s2">when civilization Falls what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.390" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">religion and that&#39;s not a certain could</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.880" end="00:54:02.140" style="s2">take I mean I&#39;m a defender of religion</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.190" end="00:54:04.719" style="s2">but a religion without the the upper</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.140" end="00:54:07.809" style="s2">level that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.719" end="00:54:11.349" style="s2">basically the Taliban it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.809" end="00:54:13.420" style="s2">something in other words some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.349" end="00:54:16.299" style="s2">mixture of gangsterism and religion will</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.420" end="00:54:19.089" style="s2">will reign over the land in the place</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.299" end="00:54:20.529" style="s2">where civilization collapses and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.089" end="00:54:21.699" style="s2">that&#39;s kinda that&#39;s my understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.529" end="00:54:25.809" style="s2">what happened in the Dark Ages in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.699" end="00:54:29.400" style="s2">however the Jews remained a distinct</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.809" end="00:54:33.670" style="s2">group they would not pledge allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.400" end="00:54:36.039" style="s2">to Christianity would not say that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.670" end="00:54:40.989" style="s2">are Christians and what that amounts to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.039" end="00:54:44.949" style="s2">in a theocracy is treason it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.989" end="00:54:48.219" style="s2">just amount to heresy or some other form</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.949" end="00:54:51.369" style="s2">of you really just it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.219" end="00:54:54.099" style="s2">religious act to not pledge allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.369" end="00:54:56.499" style="s2">to another religion in a theocracy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.099" end="00:54:58.989" style="s2">also an act of treason because you are</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.499" end="00:55:00.910" style="s2">not in a sense pledging allegiance to</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.989" end="00:55:02.920" style="s2">the governing force well it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.910" end="00:55:05.349" style="s2">like the Christians now in the Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.920" end="00:55:08.199" style="s2">world maybe you know I mean I have some</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.349" end="00:55:09.869" style="s2">more theocratic Muslim countries and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.199" end="00:55:12.459" style="s2">Christians who are stuck there being</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.869" end="00:55:14.349" style="s2">persecuted well this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.459" end="00:55:18.249" style="s2">separation of state religion is so</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.349" end="00:55:19.690" style="s2">important because in a Innis in a state</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.249" end="00:55:22.839" style="s2">which is identical with</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.690" end="00:55:26.230" style="s2">to not espouse that particular religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.839" end="00:55:28.750" style="s2">istic is to is to not is to be against</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.230" end="00:55:31.420" style="s2">the government of that land and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.750" end="00:55:35.859" style="s2">the governing force and that&#39;s that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.420" end="00:55:40.210" style="s2">that&#39;s treason and they committed they</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.859" end="00:55:41.799" style="s2">did that for 400 years now it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.210" end="00:55:46.240" style="s2">that they did that they they managed to</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.799" end="00:55:48.190" style="s2">to swing that and and I&#39;m and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:49.720" style="s2">more that they did it for providential</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.190" end="00:55:53.230" style="s2">reasons reasons you know they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.720" end="00:55:55.240" style="s2">give up their Jewish identity for for</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.230" end="00:55:55.869" style="s2">deeper reasons they know the Jews are</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.240" end="00:56:01.089" style="s2">survivors</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.869" end="00:56:03.190" style="s2">yeah but nonetheless to to not see this</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.089" end="00:56:06.099" style="s2">not understand this in that context is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.190" end="00:56:07.240" style="s2">treasonous and to knots and to see that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.099" end="00:56:11.950" style="s2">that this might not for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.240" end="00:56:14.710" style="s2">and to accuse Christianity of just</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.950" end="00:56:16.510" style="s2">simply making a tree or something based</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.710" end="00:56:18.420" style="s2">on this is not quite right because it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.510" end="00:56:21.910" style="s2">quite possible that they could have been</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.420" end="00:56:23.380" style="s2">allies with the Muslim invaders for</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.910" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">example it&#39;s more than possible because</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.380" end="00:56:27.339" style="s2">they weren&#39;t friends into Christians if</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:31.539" style="s2">you if you see it from that point it</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.339" end="00:56:33.010" style="s2">from that perspective and so so they in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.539" end="00:56:35.049" style="s2">other words if you&#39;re not with us then</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.010" end="00:56:37.510" style="s2">you may be with me you may well be with</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.049" end="00:56:39.069" style="s2">them and that&#39;s that and let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.510" end="00:56:41.619" style="s2">forget it was it was four years of war</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.069" end="00:56:44.920" style="s2">so I&#39;m thinking that there&#39;s that this</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.619" end="00:56:47.289" style="s2">is this is all right this may well be an</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.920" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">extremely important source of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.289" end="00:56:51.309" style="s2">anti-semitism which because I went out</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:53.589" style="s2">for so long because of this very</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.309" end="00:56:55.240" style="s2">entrenched in people&#39;s just totally</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.589" end="00:56:58.089" style="s2">entrenched in me and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.240" end="00:57:01.420" style="s2">Catholicism still maintained sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.089" end="00:57:03.910" style="s2">until the modern age arrived until an HS</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.420" end="00:57:04.990" style="s2">state sort of started to upend it so in</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.910" end="00:57:07.420" style="s2">other words there was still this sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.990" end="00:57:09.160" style="s2">of sorry you know there was that not</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.420" end="00:57:11.260" style="s2">much separation between state and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.160" end="00:57:14.140" style="s2">religion until the modern times until</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.260" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">the nation-state but it doesn&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.140" end="00:57:22.270" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it go back to Jesus and Paul</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:23.559" style="s2">and and all of that I mean Paul no no I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.270" end="00:57:26.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t gotten there that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.559" end="00:57:28.990" style="s2">second cause so I just described the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.440" end="00:57:30.730" style="s2">here&#39;s another thing so I just talked</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.990" end="00:57:31.830" style="s2">about sovereignty basically I just</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.730" end="00:57:34.110" style="s2">talked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.830" end="00:57:36.600" style="s2">the fusion of state and religion and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.110" end="00:57:38.310" style="s2">that means that religion is identical in</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.600" end="00:57:39.630" style="s2">a theocracy with the sovereign state a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.310" end="00:57:45.180" style="s2">lot of people don&#39;t realize this</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.630" end="00:57:47.850" style="s2">property is simply an attribute a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.180" end="00:57:51.810" style="s2">subcategory of sovereignty when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.850" end="00:57:55.020" style="s2">organize the territory the land the</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.810" end="00:57:57.240" style="s2">Kingdom in terms of its property you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.020" end="00:57:59.100" style="s2">mapping out all this property some of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.240" end="00:58:00.660" style="s2">may be private property sure but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.100" end="00:58:03.330" style="s2">still mapping it out from us from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.660" end="00:58:05.400" style="s2">perspective of sovereignty and not</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.330" end="00:58:08.730" style="s2">suffer from a perspective of taxation</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.400" end="00:58:10.530" style="s2">denying Jews property would have had to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.730" end="00:58:12.230" style="s2">do with sovereignty because after all</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.530" end="00:58:14.790" style="s2">they were they were treasonous</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.230" end="00:58:16.140" style="s2">ultimately treasonous if you see what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.790" end="00:58:18.210" style="s2">mean that means they means they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.140" end="00:58:19.710" style="s2">to be denied property is to mean your it</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.210" end="00:58:22.140" style="s2">means you&#39;re not a full member of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.710" end="00:58:25.170" style="s2">state that means soon I&#39;m getting that</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.140" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">this is all a function of this this the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.170" end="00:58:28.950" style="s2">second reason I&#39;m talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">denial of property and the entrenchment</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.950" end="00:58:35.670" style="s2">of anti-semitism due to its relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.440" end="00:58:37.050" style="s2">to sovereignty to - to treason to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.670" end="00:58:39.060" style="s2">fact that if you&#39;re not with us you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.050" end="00:58:42.330" style="s2">against us in in this very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.060" end="00:58:45.210" style="s2">time of maintaining the the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.330" end="00:58:47.220" style="s2">of the land and of Christianity which</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.210" end="00:58:50.910" style="s2">was identical with the state you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.220" end="00:58:53.400" style="s2">getting it so that&#39;s this the denying</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.910" end="00:58:55.740" style="s2">property where but when I want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.400" end="00:58:58.380" style="s2">is it is the level deeper where Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.740" end="00:59:02.790" style="s2">and Esau are at war even in the womb</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.380" end="00:59:04.290" style="s2">right okay keeps talking about this this</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.790" end="00:59:06.750" style="s2">like they were at war in the womb</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.290" end="00:59:10.350" style="s2">already of Sarah well you said something</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.750" end="00:59:13.770" style="s2">me already about lack of the Levites and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.350" end="00:59:14.970" style="s2">and I we agreed completely so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.770" end="00:59:19.530" style="s2">third reason is by far the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.970" end="00:59:21.360" style="s2">important reason the Jews had four</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.530" end="00:59:24.690" style="s2">reasons I don&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.360" end="00:59:27.950" style="s2">developed a strong antipathy a strong</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.690" end="00:59:34.170" style="s2">and it was they felt it was their divine</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.950" end="00:59:35.690" style="s2">providence to oppose human sacrifice so</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.170" end="00:59:38.829" style="s2">there was a deep commit</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.690" end="00:59:40.970" style="s2">cultural commitment inside Judaism is</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.829" end="00:59:43.970" style="s2">usually a part of their identity to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.970" end="00:59:47.240" style="s2">oppose human sacrifice it was a deep and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.970" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">and so they and so they identify</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.240" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">themselves as anti paying and they were</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:56.119" style="s2">did that was that&#39;s fundamental to their</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="01:00:00.200" style="s2">identity is to not be and we are all</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.119" end="01:00:03.470" style="s2">invited the the Gentiles into the church</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.200" end="01:00:07.880" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s right so so along</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.470" end="01:00:11.180" style="s2">comes the the Gospels and what they do</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.880" end="01:00:15.589" style="s2">is they portray a human sacrifice they</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.180" end="01:00:17.690" style="s2">portray someone being executed and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.589" end="01:00:20.329" style="s2">tried and executed miss tried and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.690" end="01:00:21.710" style="s2">executed for all the wrong reasons it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.329" end="01:00:25.609" style="s2">a totally insane</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.710" end="01:00:29.780" style="s2">trial and execution the Jews look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.609" end="01:00:31.880" style="s2">that and they say that is a human</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.780" end="01:00:33.319" style="s2">sacrifice we got nothing to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.880" end="01:00:34.490" style="s2">that&#39;s pagan shit man we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.319" end="01:00:38.599" style="s2">anywhere we&#39;re not going anywhere near</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.490" end="01:00:41.810" style="s2">it that&#39;s not that&#39;s not Jewish when in</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.599" end="01:00:43.790" style="s2">fact what that was is it was indeed a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.810" end="01:00:46.550" style="s2">human sacrifice it was a deed it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.790" end="01:00:51.339" style="s2">indeed a journey right down into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.550" end="01:00:55.819" style="s2">heart of the pagan the pagan mindset and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.339" end="01:00:57.050" style="s2">yet it went down in it it penetrated</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.819" end="01:01:00.619" style="s2">right into the heart of the pagan</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.050" end="01:01:02.660" style="s2">mindset with Jewish cultural insight</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.619" end="01:01:04.970" style="s2">with Jewish cultural importance so it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.660" end="01:01:08.690" style="s2">was in fact Jewish all of the insights</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.970" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">which show that that this is wrong that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.690" end="01:01:13.700" style="s2">this is this has to be dismantled came</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:16.010" style="s2">was information that was already</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.700" end="01:01:18.200" style="s2">contained in the Jewish testament right</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.010" end="01:01:20.869" style="s2">and and of course Jew Jesus was a Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.200" end="01:01:23.960" style="s2">rabbi now that that&#39;s who so in other</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.869" end="01:01:26.859" style="s2">words but so what happened and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.960" end="01:01:29.990" style="s2">the the fact that this great Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.859" end="01:01:32.990" style="s2">insight penetrated right down into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.990" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">heart of paganism that is what made this</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.990" end="01:01:40.099" style="s2">particular portrayal of a collective</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:42.530" style="s2">murder of human sacrifice the most</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.099" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">powerful story that is ever written</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.530" end="01:01:44.980" style="s2">about a human sacrifice about a</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:48.010" style="s2">collective murder</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.980" end="01:01:51.160" style="s2">that the power of that story is what</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.010" end="01:01:53.170" style="s2">attracted the pagan audience in much</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.160" end="01:01:54.600" style="s2">greater numbers than ever before there</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.170" end="01:01:56.380" style="s2">had been numerous stories about</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.600" end="01:01:58.480" style="s2">sacrifices right it&#39;s just that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.380" end="01:02:00.250" style="s2">weren&#39;t it weren&#39;t worth shit they would</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.480" end="01:02:02.350" style="s2">win DeLand die their work because every</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.250" end="01:02:05.140" style="s2">word they were they were Donna doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.350" end="01:02:06.730" style="s2">in fact and but this one had all in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.140" end="01:02:08.980" style="s2">crazy amount of power and the reason was</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.730" end="01:02:10.480" style="s2">because of the Jewish imports that made</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.980" end="01:02:12.580" style="s2">that gave it all the power and the power</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.480" end="01:02:16.540" style="s2">was to dismantle it in fact to negate it</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.580" end="01:02:20.650" style="s2">the pagans audience was so magnetically</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.540" end="01:02:22.359" style="s2">drawn to this and that&#39;s your exterior</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.650" end="01:02:25.600" style="s2">right it&#39;s the sense nice to end</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.359" end="01:02:29.890" style="s2">sacrifice exactly yeah exactly yeah he</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.600" end="01:02:31.510" style="s2">he&#39;s actually more he&#39;s more careful</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.890" end="01:02:33.600" style="s2">about that he&#39;s much more this is why I</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.510" end="01:02:35.950" style="s2">think of him as a Jewish thinker he</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.600" end="01:02:37.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say it&#39;s the sacrifice to wind</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.950" end="01:02:39.160" style="s2">I&#39;ll second verse even though that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.660" end="01:02:41.290" style="s2">very interpretation to make and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.160" end="01:02:42.820" style="s2">the that&#39;s the common Christian I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.290" end="01:02:46.150" style="s2">that would probably be more a more</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.820" end="01:02:48.250" style="s2">traditional Catholic argument the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.150" end="01:02:50.650" style="s2">sacrifice to end all sacrifices but he</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.250" end="01:02:52.119" style="s2">says no no no it&#39;s a it was actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.650" end="01:02:55.210" style="s2">just a mistrial it&#39;s actually just wrong</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.119" end="01:02:56.890" style="s2">so he he&#39;s kind of Jewish in that he</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.210" end="01:02:58.450" style="s2">goes right down there with this Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.890" end="01:03:00.670" style="s2">insight and says it&#39;s actually just a</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.450" end="01:03:02.830" style="s2">bunch of bullshit and but yet it was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.670" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">divine intervention to really reveal it</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.830" end="01:03:10.660" style="s2">at all the bullshit so he doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:17.350" style="s2">the preordained sacrificial mission of</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.660" end="01:03:19.330" style="s2">Jesus to go down there and be killed he</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.350" end="01:03:20.590" style="s2">knew it was gonna happen yeah straight</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.330" end="01:03:23.369" style="s2">away from that he doesn&#39;t like it he</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.590" end="01:03:26.200" style="s2">thinks that lends itself to sacrificial</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.369" end="01:03:28.510" style="s2">he one of his biggest ideas was that</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.200" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">religion needed to be desacralized</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.510" end="01:03:33.490" style="s2">and Christianity particularly needed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:36.040" style="s2">be T sacralized he I think changed his</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.490" end="01:03:38.890" style="s2">mind at the very end of his life oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.040" end="01:03:40.420" style="s2">I want to object to that but but he</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.890" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">changed his mind at the very end of his</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.420" end="01:03:45.940" style="s2">life he had a funny he had a he had a an</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:48.580" style="s2">insight at the very end in the last few</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.940" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">years it&#39;s in the his interview in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.580" end="01:03:53.920" style="s2">idea of with David Cayley he says only</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:56.109" style="s2">very recently he said have I learned</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.920" end="01:03:59.020" style="s2">this have I discovered this that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.109" end="01:04:01.300" style="s2">sacrifice has two meanings so he</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.020" end="01:04:03.790" style="s2">he had basically devoted his entire</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.300" end="01:04:06.850" style="s2">intellectual career to one particular</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.790" end="01:04:09.100" style="s2">meaning of sacrifice which basically is</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.850" end="01:04:11.410" style="s2">the type of sacrifice which is horrific</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.100" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">and needed to be negated to be stopped</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.410" end="01:04:14.290" style="s2">and then the other kind is the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:17.260" style="s2">jordan Peterson talks about maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.290" end="01:04:21.930" style="s2">there&#39;s another kind and giving up or</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.260" end="01:04:25.240" style="s2">the future or it&#39;s much it&#39;s complex and</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.930" end="01:04:27.640" style="s2">I think it has to do my taking on it I I</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.240" end="01:04:28.930" style="s2">never I never journeyed into what Tehran</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.640" end="01:04:30.250" style="s2">had to say about I&#39;m not sure he had</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.930" end="01:04:32.619" style="s2">said much to say about it he was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.250" end="01:04:35.350" style="s2">poor he&#39;s gone by then I think but but</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.619" end="01:04:38.140" style="s2">my take is just it just synonymous with</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.350" end="01:04:43.060" style="s2">existentialism every with every decision</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.140" end="01:04:44.290" style="s2">you make you are missing a million you</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.060" end="01:04:46.660" style="s2">know an infinite number of other</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.290" end="01:04:48.940" style="s2">decisions you know I&#39;m drinking a glass</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.660" end="01:04:50.770" style="s2">of water here which means I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.940" end="01:04:54.520" style="s2">drinking orange juice or whatever means</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.770" end="01:04:56.170" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m not you know holy I&#39;m holding</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.520" end="01:04:58.750" style="s2">this glass instead of holding my phone I</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.170" end="01:05:01.180" style="s2">mean um every with every just every even</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.750" end="01:05:03.490" style="s2">the tiniest decisions made you are</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.180" end="01:05:04.840" style="s2">omitting every other decision that can</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.490" end="01:05:06.730" style="s2">be possibly made I&#39;m chatting with you</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.840" end="01:05:10.920" style="s2">while I could be out you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.730" end="01:05:13.180" style="s2">could be a scoring babes yeah exactly I</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.920" end="01:05:18.670" style="s2">was gonna say something more vulgar but</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.180" end="01:05:24.790" style="s2">you got a you said the same thing you</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.670" end="01:05:26.740" style="s2">anticipated so yeah so that&#39;s what I but</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.790" end="01:05:28.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that&#39;s one definition of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.740" end="01:05:32.680" style="s2">the positive distance in other words</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.510" end="01:05:35.350" style="s2">that&#39;s we we are daily or mid upon</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.680" end="01:05:37.960" style="s2">minute life is is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.350" end="01:05:39.820" style="s2">sacrificial yeah but there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.960" end="01:05:43.480" style="s2">other aware this this impulse to blame</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.820" end="01:05:45.640" style="s2">he&#39;s he sees that we absolutely have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.480" end="01:05:46.780" style="s2">extricate in that&#39;s good that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.640" end="01:05:48.310" style="s2">that we&#39;re separating those two</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.780" end="01:05:51.400" style="s2">definitions they absolutely have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.310" end="01:05:54.100" style="s2">extricate blame and and leave it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.400" end="01:05:55.570" style="s2">contain it all for him to blame he</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.100" end="01:05:57.580" style="s2">basically I think he thinks that all</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.570" end="01:06:01.510" style="s2">forms of blame her there&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.580" end="01:06:05.410" style="s2">ultimately no I think I think he it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.510" end="01:06:08.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a radical it&#39;s a he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.410" end="01:06:12.400" style="s2">radically moving us towards a blameless</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.700" end="01:06:12.940" style="s2">although I mean it&#39;s hard to say like he</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.400" end="01:06:15.099" style="s2">thinks</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.940" end="01:06:17.980" style="s2">example Nietzsche in many ways wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.099" end="01:06:21.369" style="s2">was a the Godfather of Nazism he says</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.980" end="01:06:22.630" style="s2">that in that essay about in the in his</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.369" end="01:06:25.380" style="s2">final book which is pretty strong thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.630" end="01:06:30.190" style="s2">to say and that&#39;s kind of like a blame</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.380" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">so so maybe maybe he maybe he&#39;s maybe he</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.190" end="01:06:37.930" style="s2">does reserve some blame I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">and where was I oh yes so the the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.930" end="01:06:42.220" style="s2">reason the story of the crucifixion the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:44.380" style="s2">Christian passion is so enormously</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.220" end="01:06:48.609" style="s2">powerful is because of the is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.380" end="01:06:51.339" style="s2">insertion of Jewish anti sacrificial</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.609" end="01:06:54.869" style="s2">Jewish desacralized power right down</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.339" end="01:06:57.940" style="s2">into the right down into the the core</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.869" end="01:06:59.410" style="s2">recurrent recurring identity of paganism</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.940" end="01:07:01.599" style="s2">which is you know sacrificed a</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.410" end="01:07:03.760" style="s2">collective murder the pagans look at</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.599" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">this and they&#39;re totally drawn to it</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.760" end="01:07:07.000" style="s2">because first of all they&#39;re drawn to</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.200" end="01:07:08.470" style="s2">collect a murder anyway they&#39;re drawn to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.000" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">human sacrifice that&#39;s their natural</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.470" end="01:07:13.990" style="s2">religious night magnetic draw and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:15.700" style="s2">they are witnessing all this information</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.990" end="01:07:18.520" style="s2">that they&#39;d never heard before they</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.700" end="01:07:21.160" style="s2">never saw before and it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.520" end="01:07:23.950" style="s2">this explosion of this massive learning</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.160" end="01:07:27.369" style="s2">curve right for the pagans but but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.950" end="01:07:29.260" style="s2">problem with that is is it momenta sized</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.369" end="01:07:31.119" style="s2">it at the same time what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.260" end="01:07:33.280" style="s2">pagan culture which was would have been</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.119" end="01:07:36.579" style="s2">like a big ocean surrounding the Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.280" end="01:07:37.329" style="s2">identity floods completely floods and</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.579" end="01:07:41.200" style="s2">inundates</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.329" end="01:07:45.160" style="s2">the the Christian passion story and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.200" end="01:07:46.390" style="s2">owns it as its own and so Christian the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.160" end="01:07:48.460" style="s2">real Brit</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.390" end="01:07:50.490" style="s2">after a very short time the birth of</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.460" end="01:07:53.740" style="s2">Christianity is ultimately Jewish and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.490" end="01:07:56.800" style="s2">very very shortly after that thereafter</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.740" end="01:07:59.109" style="s2">it is it is something else lost it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.800" end="01:08:01.660" style="s2">owned by a pagan identity and what</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.109" end="01:08:04.119" style="s2">happens is the the Jewish the Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.660" end="01:08:07.510" style="s2">seed only very very slowly grows inside</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.119" end="01:08:10.540" style="s2">that thing what happens is is Rome you</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.510" end="01:08:12.310" style="s2">know Imperial Rome you know but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.540" end="01:08:14.410" style="s2">Christianity was only adopted as as the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.310" end="01:08:17.049" style="s2">official religion late in Rome I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.410" end="01:08:18.910" style="s2">know what was before but yeah it slowly</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.049" end="01:08:22.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not I&#39;m not really speaking right</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.910" end="01:08:25.239" style="s2">now yeah I yeah yeah and so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.390" end="01:08:26.949" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing the pagan flood</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.239" end="01:08:29.289" style="s2">combined with the Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.949" end="01:08:33.249" style="s2">the flood of that and an embracement of</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.289" end="01:08:36.549" style="s2">that the Christian passion combined with</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.249" end="01:08:38.380" style="s2">the the Jewish reaction and and we being</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.549" end="01:08:40.569" style="s2">repelled from the Christian passion on</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.380" end="01:08:43.329" style="s2">the grounds that it is it is human</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.569" end="01:08:45.639" style="s2">sacrifice one is repelled one rejects it</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.329" end="01:08:47.909" style="s2">the other embraces it and yet it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.639" end="01:08:50.589" style="s2">fundamentally Jewish so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.909" end="01:08:53.229" style="s2">totally bizarre contradiction at work</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.589" end="01:08:55.809" style="s2">they read and and so what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.229" end="01:08:58.359" style="s2">this pagan flood adopts this totally</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.809" end="01:08:59.559" style="s2">Jewish identity very close to the Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.359" end="01:09:03.329" style="s2">identity when you have two Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.559" end="01:09:06.279" style="s2">identity we rejects it there right there</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.329" end="01:09:08.469" style="s2">yeah this is the great these are way</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.279" end="01:09:12.130" style="s2">greater numbers than the Jewish identity</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.469" end="01:09:14.229" style="s2">the reactive reactionary Jew mmm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.130" end="01:09:17.019" style="s2">they&#39;re so it&#39;s a it&#39;s right at the</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.170" end="01:10:05.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a universalism in Christianity I</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.610" end="01:10:25.269" style="s2">understanding of Judaism as well and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.530" end="01:10:30.309" style="s2">there&#39;s something about and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.269" end="01:10:32.729" style="s2">is Judaism the nation is ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.309" end="01:10:36.670" style="s2">synonymous with the tribal identity and</p>

<p begin="01:10:49.400" end="01:10:52.970" style="s2">the nation is bigger than the tribe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.260" end="01:10:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a collection of tribes you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.970" end="01:10:57.500" style="s2">under the nation-state eventually</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.520" end="01:10:59.350" style="s2">emerged institutionally much later I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.500" end="01:11:05.690" style="s2">only it was only a few years old right</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.350" end="01:11:07.610" style="s2">the the I think my understanding of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.690" end="01:11:10.100" style="s2">nation-state is that it is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.610" end="01:11:13.970" style="s2">sacrificial in in the negative sense it</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.100" end="01:11:16.850" style="s2">grew out of it grew out of grew out of</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.970" end="01:11:19.700" style="s2">murder even though they&#39;re they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.850" end="01:11:22.130" style="s2">positive ideals that work to the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.700" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s my feeling is that Israel is an</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.130" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">imitation of the Christian creation of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:29.330" style="s2">the nation-state in other words England</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">France these these other all these</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.330" end="01:11:36.650" style="s2">European countries and small wants to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:39.200" style="s2">they that that Israel we imitate it</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.650" end="01:11:41.390" style="s2">there and and that really Israel in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.200" end="01:11:45.260" style="s2">view my view about Israel is that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.390" end="01:11:48.500" style="s2">don&#39;t take Zionism very seriously</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.260" end="01:11:50.630" style="s2">I don&#39;t think Zionism is is seriously</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.500" end="01:11:53.240" style="s2">central to Israel although it has become</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.630" end="01:11:56.720" style="s2">increasingly so I think the Holocaust is</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.240" end="01:11:59.030" style="s2">far and away the most identifying force</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.720" end="01:12:02.300" style="s2">the most important force that that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.030" end="01:12:05.930" style="s2">that is fueled Israeli identity in other</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.300" end="01:12:09.640" style="s2">words in my in I think the word Israel</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.930" end="01:12:13.070" style="s2">is almost a synonym of never again</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.640" end="01:12:15.620" style="s2">that&#39;s how I think of Israel and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.070" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">reason for the leave the the intensity</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.620" end="01:12:20.780" style="s2">around Israeli identity is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:22.760" style="s2">certainly not clear that it there it</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.780" end="01:12:24.740" style="s2">that it will it will be never again and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.760" end="01:12:27.620" style="s2">at least in my view there still is</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.740" end="01:12:29.570" style="s2">teeming under the under the surface of</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.620" end="01:12:31.610" style="s2">Western identity anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.570" end="01:12:34.460" style="s2">oh yeah that&#39;s coming up it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.610" end="01:12:36.590" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s really it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.460" end="01:12:38.750" style="s2">thing I find it very strange yeah if I</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.590" end="01:12:40.790" style="s2">see you get little hits of anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.750" end="01:12:43.100" style="s2">here and there you know you did somebody</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.790" end="01:12:44.600" style="s2">said something on Facebook or it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.100" end="01:12:46.910" style="s2">you feel it kind of bubbling to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.600" end="01:12:48.140" style="s2">surface all over again you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.910" end="01:12:50.650" style="s2">if you understand Gerard&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.140" end="01:12:55.590" style="s2">completely it becomes obvious why</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.650" end="01:12:59.800" style="s2">there and the and you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.590" end="01:13:02.140" style="s2">Jewish culture because of its deep</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.800" end="01:13:06.550" style="s2">sensitivity to this scapegoat thing is</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.140" end="01:13:10.600" style="s2">it has a Christianity as the term and de</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.550" end="01:13:12.340" style="s2">semitism is a watered down version of</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.600" end="01:13:15.699" style="s2">what it really is which is you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.340" end="01:13:17.620" style="s2">rabbi Jacob would say you hate right you</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.699" end="01:13:20.020" style="s2">know hate oh yeah how do we see</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.620" end="01:13:21.520" style="s2">anti-semitism as if it&#39;s why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.020" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">just say hatred of Jews that would make</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.520" end="01:13:26.980" style="s2">it more sure more direct no yes being</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:28.540" style="s2">what it is right yeah I think we would</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.980" end="01:13:31.030" style="s2">know what it is rather than this thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.540" end="01:13:33.460" style="s2">oh what&#39;s anti-semitism yeah yeah no I</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.030" end="01:13:36.280" style="s2">agree yeah I mean the Semites I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.460" end="01:13:39.219" style="s2">need the Arabs are Semites right so this</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.280" end="01:13:40.090" style="s2">is kind of a strange strange word to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.219" end="01:13:44.770" style="s2">used in assembly</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.090" end="01:13:51.969" style="s2">anyway the some what I was going to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.770" end="01:13:56.949" style="s2">the Israel will lose its its its sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.969" end="01:14:03.659" style="s2">of urgent identity will diminish only</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.949" end="01:14:08.320" style="s2">when it has confidence that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.659" end="01:14:10.330" style="s2">anti-jewish sentiment is is something</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.320" end="01:14:13.870" style="s2">that has been contained or has been</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.330" end="01:14:17.080" style="s2">properly contained and and it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.870" end="01:14:18.580" style="s2">been and so the and so that is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.080" end="01:14:19.780" style="s2">reason why I&#39;ve often thought why why</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.580" end="01:14:21.550" style="s2">couldn&#39;t they figure out the fucking</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.780" end="01:14:22.900" style="s2">Palestine prep because Palestine</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.550" end="01:14:24.100" style="s2">actually my understanding is they have a</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.900" end="01:14:25.630" style="s2">fairly reasonable request</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.100" end="01:14:27.790" style="s2">they had they&#39;ve said that they have</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.630" end="01:14:29.770" style="s2">their traditional land and it&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.790" end="01:14:31.890" style="s2">tani it&#39;s only a small part of Israel</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.770" end="01:14:35.230" style="s2">it&#39;s the Gaza Strip in the West Bank and</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.890" end="01:14:37.480" style="s2">and why can&#39;t why and this was back in</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.230" end="01:14:39.489" style="s2">the PLO days with yes or ephra and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.480" end="01:14:41.260" style="s2">that was Adam in the end and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.489" end="01:14:42.790" style="s2">just give us the West Bank in the Gaza</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.260" end="01:14:45.070" style="s2">and we leave you it alone we will you</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.790" end="01:14:47.409" style="s2">know we can have two countries and and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.070" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">thought that myself why don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.409" end="01:14:52.570" style="s2">fucking agree to that and and after all</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:54.820" style="s2">Israel&#39;s a tiny place anyway well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.570" end="01:14:57.340" style="s2">all in many ways just a symbolic it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.820" end="01:14:59.469" style="s2">symbolic center of Jewish culture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.340" end="01:15:00.060" style="s2">too small for a lot of them to live</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.469" end="01:15:03.370" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.060" end="01:15:04.690" style="s2">but and but the answer is what I just</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.370" end="01:15:07.270" style="s2">gave the answer</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.690" end="01:15:09.010" style="s2">reason why they&#39;re there were it will</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.270" end="01:15:10.960" style="s2">never really be fully resolved and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.010" end="01:15:13.469" style="s2">they there&#39;s this sense of large</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.960" end="01:15:16.120" style="s2">territory there and stuff is because of</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.469" end="01:15:19.000" style="s2">is because never again is not a gay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.120" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">not a given it&#39;s absolutely not a given</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.000" end="01:15:25.570" style="s2">and the more the more the West falls</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:28.900" style="s2">into turmoil the more you will have the</p>

<p begin="01:20:37.980" end="01:20:42.150" style="s2">word sin so I thought yeah that what</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:43.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what sin is is it&#39;s being</p>

<p begin="01:21:00.900" end="01:21:06.420" style="s2">the be I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.110" end="01:21:09.270" style="s2">sin this past couple weeks in it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.420" end="01:21:11.100" style="s2">there&#39;s the the extremely famous line of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.270" end="01:21:12.170" style="s2">Jesus on the cross forgive them Lord for</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.100" end="01:21:16.050" style="s2">they know not what they do</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.090" end="01:21:28.260" style="s2">this is this has no precedent he thinks</p>

<p begin="01:21:28.260" end="01:21:35.040" style="s2">suggests that in that the very first</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.699" end="01:21:36.510" style="s2">mention of the unconscious is right</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.040" end="01:21:38.880" style="s2">there forgiving them Lord for they know</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.510" end="01:21:42.210" style="s2">not what they do the the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.880" end="01:21:45.269" style="s2">not knowing what you do is it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.210" end="01:21:47.340" style="s2">call it sin if you know not what you do</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.269" end="01:21:49.800" style="s2">but it seems to me that if when you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.340" end="01:21:51.630" style="s2">what you do then it&#39;s sin yes so in</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.800" end="01:21:54.059" style="s2">other words like if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
