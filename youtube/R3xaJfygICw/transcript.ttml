<p begin="00:00:02.280" end="00:00:07.200" style="s2">third piece we needed and done so</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:09.830" style="s2">gorgeously wonderful wonderful wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.200" end="00:00:15.089" style="s2">wonderful so so let&#39;s jump into it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.830" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">maybe to two comments to kind of amplify</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.089" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">and you know dance with you here one is</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:23.189" style="s2">I want to actually cite a text which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">a prophetic text if you&#39;ll meaning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.189" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">anticipating from the 19th century that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:30.689" style="s2">appears in different forms in the great</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">traditions but I&#39;ll give you one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.689" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">forms which appears in the tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:37.800" style="s2">Hebrew mysticism and the text reads and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">I&#39;ll read it in in Hebrew reads da Boa</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">so uh shockingly misawa so hooked which</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:45.829" style="s2">means literally higher is the source of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">the vessels than the source of the light</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.829" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">so we&#39;re used to understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:52.320" style="s2">there&#39;s you know light that&#39;s held in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">vessel the vessel holds the light the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">vessel is just a vessel but the light is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">the light that&#39;s the real thing so for</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">example the body right is the temple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">the soul that&#39;s a classical expression</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">of but what&#39;s really important is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">soul and the body keep a healthy body so</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">you can hold your soul but in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">evolutionary unfolding we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.850" style="s2">realizing that split is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">limited split it&#39;s actually embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.850" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">begins to tell us that actually the body</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">itself holds spirit and the split</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">between body and spirit in which one is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">a container for the other is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">false split and then you have this kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">of emergent property in the great</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:33.689" style="s2">traditions which points towards this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">notion that actually the vessels</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">themselves are even higher in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">source right then the light now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">gonna speak I&#39;m gonna skip the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">the complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">you know Kabbalistic structures that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:47.700" style="s2">support that for a couple thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">but it&#39;s completely right for shouting</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.700" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">of course what you talked about so</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">beautifully and others technology right</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the vessel right</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:01:59.369" style="s2">technology is the light i technology is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">an intrinsic part of the emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.369" end="00:02:04.820" style="s2">the notion that technology is is merely</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">a vessel right that serves us actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.820" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">misunderstands right the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">reality itself in which it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">all a continuum right of emergence right</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">and in that emergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">which moved some inanimate to animate</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">and even the split between inanimate and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:21.050" style="s2">animate right is it kind of limited</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">split because of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.050" end="00:02:25.860" style="s2">self-organization starts all the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">down and goes all the way up and so to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.860" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">really highlight as he did so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.690" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">beautifully that actually technology is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">not an extra way that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">actually shift fundamentally how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:39.330" style="s2">experience the word technology this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.160" style="s2">acknowledge is a natural expression of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.330" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">the evolutionary process and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.160" end="00:02:46.590" style="s2">will bring radical positive evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">benefit it is enormous ly exciting yes a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.590" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">moment we asked me just leave that will</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">come back second bite afterwards it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">kind of at that point on the table well</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:55.560" style="s2">I completely agree with that mark and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">remember sometimes Bucky fuller was on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:02:57.720" style="s2">the stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.220" end="00:03:00.420" style="s2">and somebody said to him dr. fuller I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.720" end="00:03:03.180" style="s2">don&#39;t like technology and he put out his</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.420" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">tummy so do you like your thumb what</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:08.160" style="s2">happened there you had a thought there</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">was a tech name and you cut a nerve it</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:14.570" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do that is a key technique to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:16.740" style="s2">everything and he proclaimed that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.570" end="00:03:20.070" style="s2">technology will tend to be miniaturized</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.740" end="00:03:22.200" style="s2">and ephemeral eyes as it is in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.070" end="00:03:27.380" style="s2">bodies we don&#39;t even notice we have it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.200" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">and so what you&#39;re saying seems now very</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.380" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">amazingly complex but think of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">bodies with the 50 trillion cells and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:36.630" style="s2">nature managed to do that and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">things I was thinking as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.630" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">this that the same coordinating genius</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:45.570" style="s2">of evolution that got all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:47.130" style="s2">multicellular organisms up to a planet</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.570" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">that&#39;s just about to become a whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.130" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">system is at work here is both the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:58.920" style="s2">Technic technology the human intention</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">and the coordinating process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.920" end="00:04:05.730" style="s2">universal creativity that inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">drives to higher order is working with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.730" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">us in the most extraordinary way and as</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:14.820" style="s2">you were speaking I was thinking if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t believe that in the immense</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.820" end="00:04:19.650" style="s2">coordinating genius of evolution I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:21.510" style="s2">think this is too complex to do but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.650" end="00:04:22.889" style="s2">I realize our bodies are too complex to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.510" end="00:04:27.009" style="s2">do grace</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.889" end="00:04:28.620" style="s2">likes to do so I just want to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.009" end="00:04:33.340" style="s2">question of both of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.620" end="00:04:36.729" style="s2">what energetic organizational genius is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">at work here along with this to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.729" end="00:04:40.419" style="s2">empower it&#39;s because you can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">somebody&#39;s going to be President of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.419" end="00:04:44.470" style="s2">US and do it right you can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">the United Nations doing it and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.470" end="00:04:49.060" style="s2">can&#39;t think of any current power</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:52.500" style="s2">structure doing it so marked here point</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.060" end="00:04:55.000" style="s2">first about the vessels and the light</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.500" end="00:04:57.849" style="s2">we&#39;ve been reductionistic on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.000" end="00:05:01.750" style="s2">right we&#39;ve had spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.849" end="00:05:03.430" style="s2">that tried to reduce physics to an</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.750" end="00:05:05.289" style="s2">epiphenomena of consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.430" end="00:05:08.020" style="s2">consciousness is what&#39;s fundamental it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.289" end="00:05:09.669" style="s2">what&#39;s real all of this is my angry or</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.020" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">it arises from consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.669" end="00:05:13.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve had materialism that tries to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">reduce subjectivity and consciousness to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.240" end="00:05:20.919" style="s2">the working of neural phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:22.780" style="s2">co-arising is a big insight and that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.919" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">whole distinction between the two as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.780" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">separate is actually a mistake it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:27.009" style="s2">false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:28.599" style="s2">they are the inside and outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.009" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">same thing this is a key to integral</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.599" end="00:05:34.719" style="s2">theory it&#39;s a it&#39;s a key to getting any</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:38.169" style="s2">complex system actually and so to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.719" end="00:05:42.279" style="s2">an emerging physics spirituality that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.169" end="00:05:44.680" style="s2">recognizes the co-arising is so hugely</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.279" end="00:05:46.779" style="s2">unique and beautiful and with society to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.680" end="00:05:49.150" style="s2">recognize the co-arising of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.779" end="00:05:51.219" style="s2">evolutions in infrastructure in biology</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.150" end="00:05:54.610" style="s2">and economics in our narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.219" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">they have to is really key thing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.610" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">then barber - what you&#39;re saying is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:04.449" style="s2">so life does that right so we&#39;ve got 50</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">trillion unique little creatures who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.449" end="00:06:08.889" style="s2">coordinating together in a way it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.060" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">capitalist or communist or any system</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.889" end="00:06:12.669" style="s2">we&#39;ve had they don&#39;t sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.330" end="00:06:14.020" style="s2">themselves for others or others because</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.669" end="00:06:15.400" style="s2">it&#39;s symbiotic so it&#39;s good for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.020" end="00:06:17.229" style="s2">liver and the kidney is the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.400" end="00:06:19.000" style="s2">when they&#39;re all interdependent and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.229" end="00:06:20.740" style="s2">how does it do that and how can we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.000" end="00:06:21.460" style="s2">that and so this is like you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.740" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">before the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.460" end="00:06:26.229" style="s2">biomimicry or the Evo mimicry having our</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:27.969" style="s2">built world reflect the intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.229" end="00:06:29.620" style="s2">complexity of the natural world because</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.969" end="00:06:31.719" style="s2">we consciously start to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.620" end="00:06:33.370" style="s2">more and apply it but then it&#39;s one more</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.719" end="00:06:35.879" style="s2">step which is the part that excites me</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.370" end="00:06:37.889" style="s2">the most is it in the anthill</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.879" end="00:06:39.149" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this amazing distributed</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.889" end="00:06:40.589" style="s2">governance it&#39;s not a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.149" end="00:06:41.999" style="s2">governance but it&#39;s also not a unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.589" end="00:06:43.889" style="s2">self-governance because that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.999" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">ants as far as we understand so far are</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.889" end="00:06:47.490" style="s2">interchangeable in their roles for each</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:50.069" style="s2">other and so there&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.490" end="00:06:51.899" style="s2">way that that&#39;s distributed but to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.069" end="00:06:53.969" style="s2">a distributed governance that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.899" end="00:06:56.069" style="s2">emergent where all the parts are unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.969" end="00:06:59.429" style="s2">it&#39;s something that we&#39;ve actually never</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.069" end="00:07:00.929" style="s2">seen in that way and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.429" end="00:07:03.929" style="s2">there&#39;s this beautiful concept of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.929" end="00:07:05.639" style="s2">evolution itself evolving that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.929" end="00:07:07.800" style="s2">looking at building upon and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.639" end="00:07:09.659" style="s2">transcending the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.800" end="00:07:12.360" style="s2">governance that have happened so far</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.659" end="00:07:14.990" style="s2">where what&#39;s needed for us is the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:18.749" style="s2">step of evolution itself I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.990" end="00:07:22.289" style="s2">just comment because I experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.749" end="00:07:25.050" style="s2">synergistic democracy as a title because</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.289" end="00:07:27.300" style="s2">we did large conferences in big wheels</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.050" end="00:07:29.610" style="s2">where we had all the different functions</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.300" end="00:07:31.649" style="s2">health education economics and we asked</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.610" end="00:07:34.499" style="s2">people three questions what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.649" end="00:07:36.389" style="s2">to create what do you need to create it</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.499" end="00:07:40.050" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have and what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.389" end="00:07:42.719" style="s2">to share so everyone had the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.050" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">realizing their unique self which was</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.719" end="00:07:47.149" style="s2">their creativity but nobody could</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:49.889" style="s2">realize it without the other sectors</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.149" end="00:07:52.860" style="s2">participating and we actually did I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.889" end="00:07:55.949" style="s2">would say very crude demonstrations of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.860" end="00:07:59.610" style="s2">what a synergistic self-governance would</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.949" end="00:08:03.029" style="s2">be and I&#39;m just wondering if you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.610" end="00:08:04.649" style="s2">that inherent in what you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.029" end="00:08:08.789" style="s2">there would be a way of that emerging</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.649" end="00:08:10.409" style="s2">not really so for example you had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.789" end="00:08:12.569" style="s2">technology right you had the wheel of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.409" end="00:08:14.429" style="s2">co-creation that created sectors and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.569" end="00:08:16.019" style="s2">then a process to have those sectors</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.429" end="00:08:18.569" style="s2">interact with each other you had</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.019" end="00:08:19.469" style="s2">questions I was technology right and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.569" end="00:08:21.689" style="s2">fact that you didn&#39;t have higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.469" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">technology it was allowed to it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.689" end="00:08:25.259" style="s2">capable of really identifying individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:27.209" style="s2">needs and resources and matching them</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.259" end="00:08:29.129" style="s2">was the limit of it we have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.209" end="00:08:31.169" style="s2">to build those higher technologies so</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.129" end="00:08:32.459" style="s2">part of the future of economics and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.169" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">governance that I was foreshadowing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.459" end="00:08:36.589" style="s2">we have the ability to have an inventory</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:39.180" style="s2">of all the world&#39;s physical resources</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.589" end="00:08:40.310" style="s2">real-time data input from sensors an</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.180" end="00:08:42.209" style="s2">inventory of all of the needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.310" end="00:08:43.259" style="s2">comprehensive metric systems of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.209" end="00:08:46.319" style="s2">everything we&#39;re seeking to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.259" end="00:08:48.690" style="s2">roll into quality of life and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.319" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2">processors that show as we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.690" end="00:08:51.330" style="s2">I think one area how does that affect</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:53.280" style="s2">all the other areas so there are no</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.330" end="00:08:55.020" style="s2">externalities and what we do locally is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.280" end="00:08:57.270" style="s2">also what&#39;s best systemically which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.020" end="00:08:58.770" style="s2">beyond the Dunbar capacity of one human</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.270" end="00:09:01.820" style="s2">brain right now our computational</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.770" end="00:09:04.200" style="s2">capacity now put all that together and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.820" end="00:09:05.310" style="s2">if we know all the resources we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.200" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">work with we know everything we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.310" end="00:09:08.070" style="s2">trying to optimize and this is all</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">flexible we can keep adding to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.070" end="00:09:12.570" style="s2">we know how doing projects anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">affects everything else in light of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.570" end="00:09:15.960" style="s2">of those metrics and we have forecasting</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">systems so we know timelines to affect</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.960" end="00:09:18.870" style="s2">things we have the ability for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:20.580" style="s2">fundamentally different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.870" end="00:09:22.950" style="s2">governance and has ever existed before I</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.580" end="00:09:24.660" style="s2">say that so let let&#39;s look to fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.950" end="00:09:26.070" style="s2">it&#39;s been both be so that&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.660" end="00:09:28.590" style="s2">back to Daniel and Barbara&#39;s piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.070" end="00:09:31.140" style="s2">McKenna see where we are and she had</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.590" end="00:09:33.930" style="s2">these three weeks kind of each kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.140" end="00:09:36.360" style="s2">merged together synergistically so one</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:37.940" style="s2">you know in response to the second shock</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.360" end="00:09:40.350" style="s2">of existence what do we need a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.940" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">transformation of identity yeah I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.350" end="00:09:44.790" style="s2">fundamental transformation of identity</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:47.220" style="s2">and we need a fundamental reworking of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.790" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">our essential understanding of how core</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.220" end="00:09:51.030" style="s2">structures work that&#39;s the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.170" end="00:09:53.520" style="s2">respond the second shock of existence we</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.030" end="00:09:57.090" style="s2">can&#39;t respond you know patchwork so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.520" end="00:09:59.940" style="s2">need an organismic response right which</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.090" end="00:10:02.580" style="s2">highlights irreducible uniqueness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.940" end="00:10:04.790" style="s2">yet understands uniqueness not as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.580" end="00:10:06.810" style="s2">function of separateness it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.790" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">disambiguates between separate and its</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.810" end="00:10:11.070" style="s2">uniqueness right and allows for</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:14.280" style="s2">uniqueness to emerge and separateness to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.070" end="00:10:16.950" style="s2">recede and and and that essentially is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.280" end="00:10:18.210" style="s2">the evolution of love yeah right because</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.950" end="00:10:20.400" style="s2">actually the process that you were</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.210" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">describing Daniel right was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.400" end="00:10:26.730" style="s2">process of evolutionary love outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:28.710" style="s2">love driving the evolution of love and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.730" end="00:10:30.450" style="s2">you could in some sense say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.710" end="00:10:33.210" style="s2">enlightenment means there are no</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.450" end="00:10:34.290" style="s2">externalities yes the very definition of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.210" end="00:10:36.210" style="s2">enlightenment is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.290" end="00:10:36.690" style="s2">externalities no one&#39;s outside the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.210" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.690" end="00:10:40.470" style="s2">no one&#39;s commodified no one is in</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.060" end="00:10:50.790" style="s2">about and then what emerges that is and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.700" end="00:10:53.490" style="s2">here&#39;s the last piece is that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.790" end="00:10:55.380" style="s2">lose your ability to excel that was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.490" end="00:10:57.450" style="s2">Communist mistake right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.380" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">homogenized to borrow your phrase Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.450" end="00:11:01.980" style="s2">beautiful phrase right actually you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:02.339" style="s2">to excel you get to be unique self you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.980" end="00:11:04.439" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.339" end="00:11:06.449" style="s2">Shyne as a matter of fact you must shine</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.439" end="00:11:08.759" style="s2">not only you must shine it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.449" end="00:11:10.740" style="s2">interesting thing to do right is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.759" end="00:11:13.199" style="s2">actively actually be this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.740" end="00:11:14.279" style="s2">shining expression that&#39;s unlike any</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.199" end="00:11:16.589" style="s2">other and there will still be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.279" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">hierarchies right meaning some people</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.589" end="00:11:19.139" style="s2">will be better at this and other</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:20.910" style="s2">probably better at that so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.139" end="00:11:23.309" style="s2">it&#39;s not a leveling of differences it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.910" end="00:11:24.870" style="s2">not a kind of bland oneness but it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.870" end="00:11:30.149" style="s2">once we actually employ the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.779" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">evolution evolving becoming conscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.149" end="00:11:34.410" style="s2">more and more uniqueness and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:35.759" style="s2">uniqueness as the currency of connection</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.410" end="00:11:38.279" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got the evolution of</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.100" end="00:11:49.769" style="s2">have to be willing to let go of our core</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.430" end="00:15:39.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a prioritization of life support</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.020" end="00:15:41.980" style="s2">and so the whole system works to try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.700" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">not have scarcity right and so when</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.980" end="00:15:45.750" style="s2">there&#39;s not scarcity they work in huge</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">abundance and sharing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.750" end="00:15:49.870" style="s2">identical to what we&#39;re doing in human</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.870" end="00:15:54.430" style="s2">I want to know please just a very brief</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.330" end="00:15:56.200" style="s2">dream I had the other night thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.430" end="00:15:58.089" style="s2">about the peace room as sophisticated as</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.200" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">a war room I had a vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.089" end="00:16:03.790" style="s2">generals of the Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:07.690" style="s2">Eisenhower Omar Bradley Tootsie Marshall</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.790" end="00:16:09.310" style="s2">etc and it&#39;s not only because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.690" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">happen to it being Godfather&#39;s have my</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.310" end="00:16:18.400" style="s2">half-brothers but they came to me and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">said we&#39;re at your service folks right</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.400" end="00:16:23.140" style="s2">the generals probably the last great</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:25.690" style="s2">generals of epic that we&#39;ve had in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.140" end="00:16:29.110" style="s2">culture was at the Second World War they</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.690" end="00:16:31.510" style="s2">did something that had to be done and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.110" end="00:16:33.970" style="s2">would just like to call on the force</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.510" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">that&#39;s been in the military that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.970" end="00:16:41.740" style="s2">in the corporation&#39;s but particularly</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:45.430" style="s2">the very brave generals and say yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.740" end="00:16:49.660" style="s2">not just us it&#39;s it&#39;s all of us and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.430" end="00:16:52.750" style="s2">have skills that we need yeah very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.660" end="00:16:54.790" style="s2">beautiful yeah maybe just it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.750" end="00:16:55.570" style="s2">beautiful to close up and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.790" end="00:16:57.550" style="s2">I&#39;m about to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.570" end="00:16:59.260" style="s2">Barbara you consider Daniel quítate and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.550" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">said with your permission on a map of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.260" end="00:17:04.329" style="s2">all three of us what we&#39;ve all implied</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.570" end="00:17:07.000" style="s2">is that although emergence happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.329" end="00:17:09.850" style="s2">through emergency right there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.000" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">an even deeper drive right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.850" end="00:17:13.270" style="s2">actually driving the emergence I talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:15.670" style="s2">about unique self being the strange</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.270" end="00:17:17.890" style="s2">attractor of the evolutionary process I</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.670" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">mean actually what we see is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.890" end="00:17:22.329" style="s2">really critical everyone because this</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.530" end="00:17:25.030" style="s2">shows that this is not a kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.329" end="00:17:26.250" style="s2">utopia it&#39;s not a pipe dream it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.030" end="00:17:28.449" style="s2">actually the central nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.250" end="00:17:31.720" style="s2">that it actually can on the fold this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.449" end="00:17:34.150" style="s2">way is actually the highest possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.720" end="00:17:36.820" style="s2">creativity the highest possible vision</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.150" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">which actually pulls for itself right</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.820" end="00:17:39.460" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing that you began with</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:42.760" style="s2">Barbara</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.460" end="00:17:45.640" style="s2">right citing Brian that actually reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.760" end="00:17:47.800" style="s2">decided not to stop at hydrogen and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.640" end="00:17:49.420" style="s2">actually not gonna stop at a broken</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.800" end="00:17:51.190" style="s2">capitalism it&#39;s gonna move to a</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.190" end="00:17:54.520" style="s2">at a broken Marxism which clearly failed</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.230" end="00:17:57.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going to move to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.520" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">integration and actually that movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.640" end="00:18:01.420" style="s2">has got to be driven by unique selves</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:03.580" style="s2">and then the unique selves form this</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.420" end="00:18:06.340" style="s2">unique self Symphony in which everyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.580" end="00:18:09.370" style="s2">gets to transform and be gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.340" end="00:18:12.190" style="s2">and imagine if maybe to leave with this</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.370" end="00:18:13.720" style="s2">vision what would be a great unique self</p>
