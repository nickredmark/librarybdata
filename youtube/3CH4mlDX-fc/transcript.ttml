<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">gonna be a little bit broader than is</p>

<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">little bit of context is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">hopefully in the future we&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:19.260" style="s2">be able to go back and recreate this</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">particular video to be more I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.260" end="00:00:26.519" style="s2">specific so context the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">CDM project is based upon a I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.519" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">premise and a possibility so the premise</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">is that the the city is foundational to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">the nature of what I&#39;ve called game a or</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">to the fundamental basis of the toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:44.010" style="s2">that gives rise to the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:46.370" style="s2">civilizations the human beings of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.010" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">far been able to create so I&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.370" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">proposition that city is more</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">fundamental than civilization the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">possibility that I am proposing is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">we are now within a threshold we are now</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">near to a point we can in fact innovate</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">a new way living together that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">different it&#39;s a different basis than</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">the city and there for and thereby that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:15.030" style="s2">transition is fundamental it moves us</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:16.979" style="s2">from one basis that gives rise to entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.030" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">architecture of civilizations to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.979" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">potentially a very different one which</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">if we wanted to use that language we</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:25.939" style="s2">could say game Bay although I suppose a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:28.680" style="s2">bit about that these days</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.939" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">so nobody get into the into the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.680" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">this particular piece this piece is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">about about the first proposition and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">some of the context around that and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">do that I have to go into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:40.530" style="s2">of depth so this video is probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">be on the road of like 10 or 12 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.530" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">I apologize for the length the the core</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">theory here comes from work that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">done largely around the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">Institute largely with people like</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">Geoffrey West and we spent court and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">many others and you can read about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">actually in the book called scale the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">Geoffrey West produced the past couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">of years and I&#39;ll just give the a brief</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">summary kind of compress the piece that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">I think is most relevant what they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">looking at was particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">characteristics that are called scaling</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">loss which is to say if I if I increase</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">some particular characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.300" style="s2">like let&#39;s say for example I have a one</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:20.850" style="s2">brick and that brick weighs one pound</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">and I increase one characteristic so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.850" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">increase from one brick to ten bricks so</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">this gives an increasing number how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:28.740" style="s2">pounds do I have well in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">bricks it&#39;s a linear scaling loss if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.740" end="00:02:31.850" style="s2">have gone from one brick to ten bricks</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve gone from one pound to ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.850" end="00:02:36.420" style="s2">and they were looking at various all</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:37.710" style="s2">kinds of different systems in nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.420" end="00:02:39.000" style="s2">looking at what kinds of scaling laws</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.710" end="00:02:41.460" style="s2">were there what they found was that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">there was a very profound fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.460" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">that in many important characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">like for example the ratio between body</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">mass and metabolism or body mass and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">like amount of vascular tissue like how</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">long would your vascular system if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:01.350" style="s2">kind of could lay it all out and measure</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">it that there was a an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.350" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">regularity of what are called sub linear</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">scaling laws and very specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:13.790" style="s2">fact xx 5 which is to say for example if</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">I have a mouse that weighs 100 grams and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.790" end="00:03:23.010" style="s2">I and it has a metabolic rate X and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">double its mass to 200 grams I don&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.010" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">fact double it its metabolism in fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:28.709" style="s2">right because my a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:31.140" style="s2">increase it by only eighty-five percent</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">more or less like I&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.140" end="00:03:36.660" style="s2">brush broad brush into the zone here and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">this the sub linear scaling is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.660" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">fundamentally characteristic you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">even see it&#39;s at the very heart of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">living systems specifically dissipative</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.739" style="s2">systems I think but in any event living</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">systems so with you looking at cells or</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.739" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">organisms we&#39;re looking at mammals or</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">reptiles whether you&#39;re looking at by</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">the way trees or forests right entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:03:59.730" style="s2">ecosystems that are multi species you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:02.840" style="s2">still see these seen this exact same</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">kind of sub linear scaling dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.840" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">that&#39;s huge is it&#39;s an enormous ly</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:10.769" style="s2">important finding and it talks about for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2">example how systems have limits to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.769" end="00:04:14.610" style="s2">growth built in elephants are kind of as</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.140" end="00:04:15.660" style="s2">big as they&#39;re going to get blue wheels</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.610" end="00:04:17.700" style="s2">are as big as they&#39;re going to get in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.660" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">the context of that particular niche for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.700" end="00:04:22.410" style="s2">example and when they wouldn&#39;t started</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">looking at human systems they found the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.410" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">human systems also more or less and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">give you the exception a minute fell</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">under the same rule</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:37.069" style="s2">so if I take a corporation and I add</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:41.159" style="s2">more people I don&#39;t for example increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.069" end="00:04:44.099" style="s2">revenue per person linearly actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.159" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">increases on kind of like a asymptote so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.099" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">when I go from a thousand people to two</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">thousand people I don&#39;t double the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">revenue per person in fact I attend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:54.900" style="s2">actually each per capita input reduces</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">which means that corporations have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.900" end="00:04:58.349" style="s2">natural asymptote at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">you&#39;re just not getting any more</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.349" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">productivity out of the individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:06.900" style="s2">you&#39;re adding into the system we also</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">see in for example cities that if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.900" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">take a look at the population of a city</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">and you look at for example the length</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:15.569" style="s2">of roads in the city or the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:19.830" style="s2">length total measure of say telephone</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.569" end="00:05:21.060" style="s2">lines or or sewers the same basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.830" end="00:05:22.919" style="s2">characteristic if I double the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.060" end="00:05:24.539" style="s2">population of a city the the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.919" end="00:05:27.659" style="s2">the length of roads does not double it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.539" end="00:05:28.770" style="s2">increases by eighty five percent okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.659" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">that&#39;s cool so what&#39;s that saying is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.770" end="00:05:34.770" style="s2">these human built systems are very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">like biological systems so a city is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.770" end="00:05:40.319" style="s2">like in in this context a city is like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">forest but and this but is the point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.319" end="00:05:45.779" style="s2">this video frankly the entire series to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:48.389" style="s2">be perfectly frank with regard to other</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.779" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">characteristics cities and only in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.389" end="00:05:55.380" style="s2">cities did they find not just not a sub</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.500" end="00:05:57.419" style="s2">linear scaling metric but a super linear</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.380" end="00:05:59.610" style="s2">scaling metric so what that means what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.419" end="00:06:02.370" style="s2">it meant was that with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.610" end="00:06:04.469" style="s2">something like say income per capita so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a city of a million everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.469" end="00:06:09.300" style="s2">makes let&#39;s just say on average ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">thousand dollars a month if I double the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.300" end="00:06:15.960" style="s2">population of the city the per capita</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:19.889" style="s2">income goes up by about fifteen percent</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.960" end="00:06:21.810" style="s2">so it&#39;s 115 so instead of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.889" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">making $10,000 a month now everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.810" end="00:06:26.430" style="s2">makes eleven thousand five hundred now</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:29.159" style="s2">this is a very important thing because</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.430" end="00:06:32.909" style="s2">it means that if I&#39;m choosing between</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.159" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">city a and City B and City a is a five</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">is a million person city then on average</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.370" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">just me being exactly the same nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:48.750" style="s2">about me I will make more money going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:50.340" style="s2">city be 15% were hardly enough and by</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.750" end="00:06:52.260" style="s2">the way if there&#39;s a city see it&#39;s a 2</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.260" end="00:06:55.410" style="s2">more money go into cities see now of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.270" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">course what that means is that more</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.410" end="00:06:58.230" style="s2">likely I will choose the biggest city</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.120" style="s2">which means the biggest cities gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.230" end="00:07:03.630" style="s2">tend to get bigger and here it is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.120" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">very powerful thing in some very strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.630" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:13.500" style="s2">cities are to people like stars are to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:16.140" style="s2">atoms there&#39;s a desire sometimes a</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.140" end="00:07:19.770" style="s2">people as possible into the city because</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.790" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">if you increase the population then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.770" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">increase things like wealth and by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:27.450" style="s2">way also innovation so this gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">to a very powerful dynamic just like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.450" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">star by the way where a star kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:32.220" style="s2">wants to collapse to a singularity from</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.220" end="00:07:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s pushing against the electro Matic</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.050" end="00:07:41.250" style="s2">can and that gives you the dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.490" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2">the star cities have the attractor of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.250" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">wanting to get more people in the city</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.380" end="00:07:49.770" style="s2">to increase the wealth and innovation</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.950" end="00:07:57.150" style="s2">around but for one thing people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.080" end="00:07:58.770" style="s2">physical bodies so they have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.150" end="00:08:00.330" style="s2">space there&#39;s only a storm to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.770" end="00:08:03.030" style="s2">can pack into a particular piece of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">space or giving them food but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.030" end="00:08:05.730" style="s2">only so much food you could produce in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:06.570" style="s2">the city if you&#39;re producing the food</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.730" end="00:08:08.340" style="s2">out of the city you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.570" end="00:08:10.350" style="s2">transportation so if you can only walk</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.340" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">for example then there&#39;s no so far you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.350" end="00:08:14.520" style="s2">can bring food and water etc and also</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:18.419" style="s2">moving waste out of the city as</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.520" end="00:08:20.880" style="s2">constraints and so we see is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.419" end="00:08:22.919" style="s2">seeking on the part of cities to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.880" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">maximally use the technology that is</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.020" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">running into the limits of that so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.780" end="00:08:47.940" style="s2">Romans could build aqueducts but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:50.670" style="s2">Babylonians couldn&#39;t build off so they</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:02.700" style="s2">build skyscrapers in fact a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">people into the same space and okay next</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.700" end="00:09:07.820" style="s2">piece this piece is by the way</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">creates fragility so the city is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.570" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">endeavouring to spring as many people</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:21.060" style="s2">into it notice that as it brings more</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:22.620" style="s2">people in it gets more wealth and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.060" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">gets more innovation so it has the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:26.760" style="s2">capacity to start trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:28.530" style="s2">how to solve problems so again there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.760" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">a point at which Rome couldn&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.530" end="00:09:31.530" style="s2">enough water in but they can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:33.420" style="s2">how to build aqueducts they build these</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.530" end="00:09:36.020" style="s2">aqueducts and pull water from hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.420" end="00:09:38.760" style="s2">of miles away to be able to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.020" end="00:09:40.260" style="s2">support the population now here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.760" end="00:09:44.040" style="s2">proposition the proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.260" end="00:09:47.220" style="s2">effectively the entire population of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.040" end="00:09:49.020" style="s2">region is composed of the city and its</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.220" end="00:09:51.240" style="s2">support infrastructure and so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.020" end="00:09:52.830" style="s2">hypothesis is that the city is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.240" end="00:09:54.960" style="s2">get as many people as possible into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.830" end="00:09:57.630" style="s2">center and literally everything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.960" end="00:09:59.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t in the center is just support</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.630" end="00:10:01.320" style="s2">infrastructure so if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.070" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">contemporary Western world in particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.320" end="00:10:04.740" style="s2">you see something that looks like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:07.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve got giant cities that have sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.740" end="00:10:08.760" style="s2">of evaporated the population out of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.230" end="00:10:10.980" style="s2">out of their local environment but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.760" end="00:10:13.980" style="s2">sort of population deserts except for</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.980" end="00:10:17.220" style="s2">the location that can provide support</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.980" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">infrastructure and in some cases that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.220" end="00:10:20.940" style="s2">support infrastructure has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">locations where people who really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.940" end="00:10:25.740" style="s2">want to be in cities can still be okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:28.050" style="s2">and then what happens is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.740" end="00:10:29.790" style="s2">dynamic of packing more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.050" end="00:10:32.850" style="s2">and pushes it to the limits which means</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.790" end="00:10:34.230" style="s2">that is optimizing for the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">increase the number of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.230" end="00:10:40.260" style="s2">city which means that it&#39;s becoming</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.870" end="00:10:54.180" style="s2">like crime and disease also tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.470" end="00:10:55.560" style="s2">increase super linearly so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.180" end="00:10:57.750" style="s2">build techniques to try to reduce that</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.939" end="00:11:17.720" style="s2">example I would propose that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.679" end="00:11:20.509" style="s2">collapse of the Roman Empire wasn&#39;t some</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.720" end="00:11:23.179" style="s2">very distinct sense the actual collapse</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.509" end="00:11:26.119" style="s2">of the city of Rome and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.179" end="00:11:27.110" style="s2">was support infrastructure now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.119" end="00:11:28.819" style="s2">pretty bold claim and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.110" end="00:11:30.410" style="s2">necessarily need to hang my hat too much</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.819" end="00:11:36.290" style="s2">on that last piece but the key idea here</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.410" end="00:11:37.790" style="s2">is city attraction repulsion dynamic has</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.290" end="00:11:42.230" style="s2">being fundamental to the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">civilization until now because if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.230" end="00:11:45.980" style="s2">think about it if you look at it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.439" style="s2">what you might say what I&#39;m proposing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.980" end="00:11:50.839" style="s2">that the core attractor is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.439" end="00:11:52.249" style="s2">the city the dynamic is actually more</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.839" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">abstract and what we&#39;ve seen in the city</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.249" end="00:11:58.579" style="s2">is really just the fact that bodies are</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.579" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">that really wants to happen the thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.619" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2">the real driver of the super linear</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:09.199" style="s2">scaling metric is Minds in relationship</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.980" end="00:13:06.860" style="s2">the next wave of virtual reality have</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.170" end="00:13:20.200" style="s2">idiom is a concept based on that premise</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.540" end="00:13:22.870" style="s2">the CVM is a concept that says</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.870" end="00:13:26.500" style="s2">is best done in the virtual and render</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.940" end="00:13:28.329" style="s2">into the physical what is best under the</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.550" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">whole game so what do I mean what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.860" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">is creative generative collaboration in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:42.910" style="s2">the virtual and now here we can&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:44.920" style="s2">fact have a single city one place for</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.910" end="00:13:46.089" style="s2">all minds at least in principle can be</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.899" end="00:14:01.329" style="s2">relationship how do we actually build</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.980" end="00:14:03.070" style="s2">this virtual environment so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.329" end="00:14:04.540" style="s2">maximally generative there&#39;s a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.070" end="00:14:06.370" style="s2">space we have to take this seriously not</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.540" end="00:14:08.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be not an adjunct</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.370" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">to civilization but a fully symmetric</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.920" end="00:14:15.790" style="s2">basis to civilization with the physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:18.040" style="s2">side now by the way this implies that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.790" end="00:14:20.709" style="s2">should get significant increases in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.040" end="00:14:22.750" style="s2">wealth and innovation if I can take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.709" end="00:14:24.610" style="s2">biggest cities in the world and increase</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.750" end="00:14:27.010" style="s2">them by what about seven or eight</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.610" end="00:14:28.269" style="s2">doublings I&#39;m increasing wealth by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.010" end="00:14:31.959" style="s2">so for example if I were to take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.269" end="00:14:34.209" style="s2">population of Tokyo and now move that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.959" end="00:14:36.519" style="s2">include the entire human population the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.209" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">average income would go up by about 3 or</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.519" end="00:14:43.149" style="s2">5 X there&#39;s a lot ok so that&#39;s one side</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:44.890" style="s2">on the other side when I have made this</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.149" end="00:14:46.660" style="s2">decoupling and now bided are not being</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.890" end="00:14:49.540" style="s2">squeezed together because the body is</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.660" end="00:14:52.930" style="s2">the substrate for relationship now the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.540" end="00:14:56.230" style="s2">bodies can be returned to humaneness to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.930" end="00:14:58.420" style="s2">a more humane way of living living in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.230" end="00:15:00.459" style="s2">the tomorrow limit you&#39;re living among</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.420" end="00:15:03.399" style="s2">people who you know well strong link</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.459" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">relationships family community living in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.399" end="00:15:07.149" style="s2">nature making sure that the place that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:10.620" style="s2">you&#39;re living is built at human scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.149" end="00:15:12.940" style="s2">very walkable very quiet low toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.620" end="00:15:16.260" style="s2">where you always have relationship with</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.260" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">and and by the way I suspect that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.010" end="00:15:26.440" style="s2">is not just awesome I know not only does</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:28.269" style="s2">it does it I&#39;ll give us back a whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.440" end="00:15:32.589" style="s2">bunch of values that we&#39;ve had to give</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.269" end="00:15:33.910" style="s2">up in the context of the the gluttony of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.589" end="00:15:35.650" style="s2">the city</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.910" end="00:15:38.770" style="s2">I suspect it&#39;s actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.650" end="00:15:40.330" style="s2">obligate to enable the virtual to be as</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.770" end="00:15:42.490" style="s2">powerful as it needs to be so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.330" end="00:15:46.540" style="s2">example imagine most people now are</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.490" end="00:15:48.010" style="s2">experiencing the fact that interaction</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.540" end="00:15:49.800" style="s2">via the virtual like we would say for</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.010" end="00:15:51.580" style="s2">example in a zoom conference is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.800" end="00:15:53.200" style="s2">substantially more draining than</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.580" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">interaction in the physical mind if I if</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.200" end="00:15:57.700" style="s2">I&#39;m in a room of 12 people I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:16:00.210" style="s2">conversation with 12 people for me at</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.700" end="00:16:03.580" style="s2">least as an introvert it&#39;s very draining</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.210" end="00:16:05.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s training us can say X but if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.580" end="00:16:07.000" style="s2">have that same length of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.530" end="00:16:10.090" style="s2">with those same 12 people but it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.000" end="00:16:12.700" style="s2">in a zoom call it is substantially more</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.090" end="00:16:17.830" style="s2">draining let&#39;s say 2x it&#39;s more like 5x</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.700" end="00:16:20.260" style="s2">but whatever now imagine if when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.830" end="00:16:22.420" style="s2">finish that zoom conference instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.260" end="00:16:24.550" style="s2">dropping back into your body in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.420" end="00:16:26.650" style="s2">context that you&#39;re in now you dropped</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.550" end="00:16:29.260" style="s2">into a context that is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.650" end="00:16:32.350" style="s2">nurturing for human beings you were able</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.260" end="00:16:33.850" style="s2">to go sit under a shade tree next to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.350" end="00:16:35.710" style="s2">running water maybe you can swim in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.850" end="00:16:37.330" style="s2">water or he could go out and interact</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.710" end="00:16:40.360" style="s2">with people with whom you have very</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.330" end="00:16:42.130" style="s2">healthy relationship and do something</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.360" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">together like build a wall or dig in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.130" end="00:16:44.820" style="s2">garden or whatever it happens to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:47.050" style="s2">debate is very human</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.820" end="00:16:48.910" style="s2">how much more grounding that is and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.050" end="00:16:51.280" style="s2">returns your nervous system back to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.910" end="00:16:53.380" style="s2">state of health so that you can then</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.280" end="00:16:54.610" style="s2">cycle back into the virtual and extend</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.380" end="00:16:56.650" style="s2">that creativity in their generativity</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.610" end="00:16:58.390" style="s2">like this movement between the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.650" end="00:17:00.190" style="s2">and the physical now becomes something</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.390" end="00:17:02.500" style="s2">that we can breathe a couple Reed couple</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.190" end="00:17:03.760" style="s2">in a right way and get a lot more out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.500" end="00:17:07.450" style="s2">it and a lot more out of it that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.760" end="00:17:09.160" style="s2">healthy so that&#39;s the notion all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.450" end="00:17:11.830" style="s2">so the idea here is that we can take</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.160" end="00:17:13.630" style="s2">this incredibly powerful generator of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.830" end="00:17:16.780" style="s2">wealth and innovation that has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.630" end="00:17:18.610" style="s2">captured in the city which has a whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.780" end="00:17:20.860" style="s2">bunch of characteristics of forcing us</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.610" end="00:17:25.000" style="s2">into situations that are increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.860" end="00:17:27.610" style="s2">inhumane not healthy for humans and pop</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.000" end="00:17:30.850" style="s2">that apart and increase it by a factor</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.610" end="00:17:32.200" style="s2">of 5 to 7 at the virtual level so get</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.850" end="00:17:34.180" style="s2">something more generative than the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.200" end="00:17:36.970" style="s2">cities that have dreamed of being but at</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.180" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">the same time recover and get back all</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.970" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">of the human scale living that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:46.420" style="s2">to surrender and return to that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:47.590" style="s2">wholesomeness of life the many of us I</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.420" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">think you&#39;re in for and</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.900" end="00:18:13.900" style="s2">much of it will continue to have to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.789" end="00:18:19.500" style="s2">gives rise to an opportunity to extend</p>
