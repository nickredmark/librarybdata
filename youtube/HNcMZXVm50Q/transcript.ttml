<p begin="00:03:42.479" end="00:03:49.229" style="s2">back into academia and spent a few years</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.569" end="00:03:52.709" style="s2">in Malaysia running the unit of the UN</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:17.170" style="s2">of maybe the world doesn&#39;t just need a</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.170" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">needs a planetary health forum and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">that forum could look and how it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:32.890" style="s2">be a decentralized forum so more people</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:35.770" style="s2">could get involved with it and who might</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.890" end="00:04:40.290" style="s2">be keep actors in participating in</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.770" end="00:04:44.860" style="s2">funding such a vision of an annual</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.860" end="00:04:51.990" style="s2">just such a wonderful deeply gratifying</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">development to know that in a tiny</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.880" end="00:06:04.450" style="s2">four five and six really I already</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.960" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">like a long time in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.670" end="00:06:38.680" style="s2">transition we&#39;re in I&#39;m amazed that we</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.680" end="00:06:44.530" style="s2">health is catching on and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.890" end="00:06:46.900" style="s2">real support in working on it and it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.530" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">the important bit is that it becomes</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.129" end="00:12:57.649" style="s2">have such a strong impact on human</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.009" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">health but it&#39;s also about stopping to</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.319" end="00:13:09.319" style="s2">and therefore create very unhealthy</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.800" end="00:13:23.720" style="s2">the curtains and then fire regulations</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.620" end="00:13:26.199" style="s2">adding flame retardants for everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.720" end="00:13:30.139" style="s2">which are demonstrated as being</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.199" end="00:13:32.689" style="s2">carcinogenic and yet we we we still have</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.139" end="00:13:35.779" style="s2">regulations that force us to put these</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.689" end="00:13:39.649" style="s2">carcinogens on every hotel room pillow</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.779" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">and every hotel room bed sheet and many</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.620" end="00:13:52.220" style="s2">so you can see that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:58.030" style="s2">about this concept of planetary health</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.220" end="00:14:03.200" style="s2">as a scale linking factor that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.030" end="00:14:06.200" style="s2">demonstrates whether we are acting</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.200" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">that there is so much work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.190" end="00:14:14.780" style="s2">also as I mentioned before in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:18.980" style="s2">particularly the way we grow food and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.780" end="00:14:24.440" style="s2">grow biomaterials and we how food</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.980" end="00:14:27.650" style="s2">affects our health that I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.440" end="00:14:32.410" style="s2">thrilled to have made this connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.650" end="00:14:34.790" style="s2">and this was a rather long diary entry I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.410" end="00:14:37.580" style="s2">wonder if anybody actually gets to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.790" end="00:14:41.180" style="s2">point and listens to it all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.580" end="00:14:44.540" style="s2">the end but I would love your comments</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.180" end="00:14:49.640" style="s2">any links that people have to health</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.540" end="00:14:52.550" style="s2">related articles and groups that work on</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.800" end="00:15:03.350" style="s2">hope that I find a new way of creating</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:05.630" style="s2">maybe an institute or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.350" end="00:15:08.120" style="s2">association that allows me to receive</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.630" end="00:15:09.830" style="s2">funding to be able to do this work more</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.120" end="00:15:12.530" style="s2">because one of the other things that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.830" end="00:15:15.290" style="s2">talked with Anthony come upon about is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.530" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">that I find it very hard to join this</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.290" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">meeting at the the famous Bellagio</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.390" end="00:15:30.740" style="s2">about planetary health is something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.460" end="00:15:32.420" style="s2">that I would learn a lot from but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.740" end="00:15:35.060" style="s2">I could also contribute something too</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.420" end="00:15:36.890" style="s2">but very often the people who meet are</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.590" end="00:16:06.100" style="s2">and so I do sometimes but every time I</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.100" end="00:16:10.570" style="s2">five days and it takes true they days to</p>
