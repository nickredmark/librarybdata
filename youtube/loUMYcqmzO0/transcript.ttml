<p begin="00:02:27.299" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">created a website called together tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.609" end="00:02:35.459" style="s2">with Wix that explains a bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">I tried to put it in the comment section</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.459" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">or another comments the description</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:40.379" style="s2">because I already down the description</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:43.079" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t let me edit because I hadn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.079" end="00:02:47.129" style="s2">beautiful irony that my technical</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.510" end="00:02:49.439" style="s2">literacy isn&#39;t up where I would like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.129" end="00:02:51.299" style="s2">to be and yet I am starting the mother</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.439" end="00:02:53.609" style="s2">of all tech startups to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.299" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">but that&#39;s the point I don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.609" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">all those things we no longer need</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:04.790" style="s2">everyone to be everything in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">we need people to be who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.790" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">have the tools in place to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:12.269" style="s2">with other people who can make up where</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">they lack and that&#39;s what I will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.269" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">doing we will be doing when it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">week more we less I so I have an outline</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:26.519" style="s2">here I do it&#39;s like oh yeah I have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:34.439" style="s2">actually start the starting point</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.519" end="00:03:37.939" style="s2">alright so we creating the ideas in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.439" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">regular everyday society we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.939" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">infrastructure that we all use we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">roads we have hospitals and schools and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:48.299" style="s2">things that we don&#39;t need to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:50.099" style="s2">created our ourselves in order to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.299" end="00:03:52.109" style="s2">infrastructure it&#39;s called him structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.099" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">and I&#39;m looking to create the online</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.109" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2">infrastructure for a brand new system</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">and so instead of me or a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:03.329" style="s2">creating it and in which case we comp</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:04.919" style="s2">against everything that every other</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.329" end="00:04:07.409" style="s2">corporation and individual comes up</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:09.389" style="s2">against witches marketing issues and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.409" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">financial issues and credibility issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.389" end="00:04:15.479" style="s2">and then I even if you&#39;re successful and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">create a project it&#39;s an isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.479" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">then everything else is in competition</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">with it or if it is working together</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.530" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">then someone&#39;s paying someone and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:26.789" style="s2">there&#39;s inefficiency there so creating a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">Tec system a bunch of apps that work</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.789" end="00:04:35.099" style="s2">together to improve our our world why</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">technology alleged yes technology to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.099" end="00:04:40.650" style="s2">is an amazing tool it gives us the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">ability to do this in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.650" end="00:04:47.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been possible two decades</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:51.300" style="s2">ago or even probably a decade ago and is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.220" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">only now starting to be it&#39;s only now</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.300" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">starting that like people enough people</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">are waking up to the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">world is maybe not doing so great but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:02.690" style="s2">there&#39;s enough technology to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:05.069" style="s2">create the ways to collaborate as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.690" end="00:05:07.409" style="s2">so return so anyway the reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.069" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">technology is I see technology having</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.409" end="00:05:15.780" style="s2">three main solutions for us one is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:17.729" style="s2">knowledge so everything you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.780" end="00:05:20.819" style="s2">about is online it&#39;s just not organized</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.729" end="00:05:25.169" style="s2">nor do we know if we can trust it and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.819" end="00:05:26.550" style="s2">even this idea that under like when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.169" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">watch a documentary they&#39;re like but do</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">your own research it&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:30.930" style="s2">we&#39;re all supposed to not only like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">can&#39;t trust that you&#39;re telling me the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.930" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">information I have to go do my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:37.259" style="s2">research and even if I do and it proves</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">you right or wrong I then have to tell</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.259" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">the person I&#39;m talking to you to go do</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:42.539" style="s2">their own research right they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">well I did the research it show this so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.539" end="00:05:45.870" style="s2">there&#39;s that trust component that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:48.479" style="s2">need and it&#39;s just not accessible for</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.870" end="00:05:50.460" style="s2">everyone to research everything right</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:52.759" style="s2">there&#39;s enough hours in the day we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.460" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">to be able to trust somewhere but</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.759" end="00:05:56.430" style="s2">understandably we don&#39;t trust and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:58.349" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t trust what&#39;s already out there</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.430" end="00:06:00.840" style="s2">right how do you know it&#39;s credible how</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.349" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">do you know just that how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">it&#39;s credible how do you know it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">and trustworthy and for me the only way</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:10.259" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be able to trust it is if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:14.460" style="s2">involved in the creation of it if I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.259" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">see transparently where that information</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.460" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">came from how could that information is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">and what we can do with that information</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.440" style="s2">and for me I wanted to be able to I want</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:24.840" style="s2">to be able to understand it my brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.440" end="00:06:27.030" style="s2">understand it so we want information</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.840" end="00:06:30.569" style="s2">that is trustworthy and accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.030" end="00:06:32.069" style="s2">all different learning types and with</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.569" end="00:06:33.630" style="s2">the crowd we can do that we already</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.069" end="00:06:35.699" style="s2">aren&#39;t I mean that I mean Wikipedia does</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.630" end="00:06:38.690" style="s2">that in a large way but it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.699" end="00:06:40.250" style="s2">transparent and it&#39;s not democratic so</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.690" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">if you come up with something that uses</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.250" end="00:06:44.750" style="s2">Wikipedia&#39;s information you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.180" end="00:06:50.660" style="s2">profit but they&#39;re not for profit like</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.710" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">you have to go through all of the steps</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.660" end="00:06:56.210" style="s2">to getting permission to do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:06:58.550" style="s2">it is to make knowledge base that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.210" end="00:07:00.260" style="s2">all trust and all use because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.550" end="00:07:02.060" style="s2">decided what that means right like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.260" end="00:07:04.370" style="s2">makes science trustworthy what is and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.060" end="00:07:05.900" style="s2">then we&#39;re voting on the algorithm that</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.370" end="00:07:07.600" style="s2">makes a trustworthy we&#39;re not voting on</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.900" end="00:07:11.090" style="s2">whether this one piece of science is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.600" end="00:07:13.070" style="s2">good or bad that makes sense one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:18.110" style="s2">other things technology does is connects</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.070" end="00:07:21.110" style="s2">us Facebook good bad ugly makes it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.110" end="00:07:23.030" style="s2">that I have at least surface level</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.110" end="00:07:24.980" style="s2">interactions with people that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.030" end="00:07:26.690" style="s2">see on a daily basis that like my high</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.980" end="00:07:30.620" style="s2">school friends or high school</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:34.130" style="s2">acquaintances my extended family the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.620" end="00:07:36.650" style="s2">&#39;train has connected us in ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.130" end="00:07:39.910" style="s2">were never able to before and that my</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.650" end="00:07:42.200" style="s2">parents can watch my kid grow up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.910" end="00:07:44.150" style="s2">actually feel even though they&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.200" end="00:07:45.710" style="s2">the same city can actually feel a real</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.150" end="00:07:47.870" style="s2">connection with her and she feels a real</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.710" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">connection with them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.870" end="00:07:54.280" style="s2">able to watch it watched video to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:57.470" style="s2">their hope to do that over Skype right</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.280" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">so the other thing it does kind of with</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.470" end="00:08:02.060" style="s2">knowledge and connection is this like</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">tools and systems that are created like</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.060" end="00:08:07.370" style="s2">apps and systems that we never really</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:09.590" style="s2">had in place before like Airbnb or uber</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.370" end="00:08:11.150" style="s2">which they don&#39;t create their own like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.590" end="00:08:12.919" style="s2">they didn&#39;t create a hotel they created</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.150" end="00:08:14.390" style="s2">a system that allows people to rent out</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.919" end="00:08:15.890" style="s2">a room they didn&#39;t create their fleet of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.390" end="00:08:19.790" style="s2">vehicles they created a system that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.890" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">helped people drivers be able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.790" end="00:08:23.570" style="s2">rides to people with their own vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:26.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a system a service that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.570" end="00:08:28.970" style="s2">created and it&#39;s a for-profit system</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.030" end="00:08:31.310" style="s2">that they created but the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.970" end="00:08:33.530" style="s2">overnight a collective could start their</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:35.750" style="s2">own mover and own their own Airbnb and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.530" end="00:08:36.890" style="s2">take over it&#39;s the only way to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.750" end="00:08:40.010" style="s2">those over because they do have a place</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.890" end="00:08:42.260" style="s2">in that a big place in the market so if</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.010" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">we&#39;re able to create our own system that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.260" end="00:08:49.310" style="s2">has knowledge we can trust helps us get</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:51.170" style="s2">connected to people whether one single</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.310" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">partner in relationship whether business</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.170" end="00:08:56.660" style="s2">partners</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:59.690" style="s2">in a group are spiritual communities or</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.660" end="00:09:01.580" style="s2">our hobby communities that we can easily</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.690" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">find people to connect with because when</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.580" end="00:09:05.930" style="s2">you give people connection and a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:08.270" style="s2">of purpose in place a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2">horrible evils in this world disappear a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.270" end="00:09:12.200" style="s2">lot of them exist because people feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.250" end="00:09:17.030" style="s2">isolated and lonely and disconnected and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.200" end="00:09:18.140" style="s2">misunderstood and so yeah so although in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.030" end="00:09:20.300" style="s2">my vision</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.140" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">we eventually like only means of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.300" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">production and there&#39;s this parallel</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:29.870" style="s2">system that competes with and if done</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:33.050" style="s2">right I then we out-compete competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.870" end="00:09:34.370" style="s2">together because cooperation is more</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.050" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">powerful than competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.370" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just how it works like if you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">one person in a hundred in a discipline</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.110" style="s2">that&#39;s willing to cooperate and share</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:46.970" style="s2">that knowledge with everyone else they</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.110" end="00:09:48.590" style="s2">Trump the 99 that aren&#39;t right like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.970" end="00:09:49.820" style="s2">those 99 they&#39;re in competition and like</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.590" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2">no I don&#39;t want to I&#39;ll put me out of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.820" end="00:09:52.760" style="s2">job well you just need one if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">hundred to put that information out</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.760" end="00:09:58.280" style="s2">there and yeah maybe if that was your</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">only job was to be a gatekeeper to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.280" end="00:10:02.390" style="s2">knowledge sorry that&#39;s no longer a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.280" style="s2">needed profession be able to use that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.390" end="00:10:09.020" style="s2">knowledge and in a better way with</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.280" end="00:10:11.420" style="s2">someone is definitely needed so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.020" end="00:10:12.680" style="s2">of owning it together that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.420" end="00:10:13.940" style="s2">called together tech because we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.680" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">it together we&#39;re gonna create it</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.940" end="00:10:16.910" style="s2">together we&#39;re gonna run it together</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:20.090" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna fund it together and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.910" end="00:10:23.030" style="s2">gonna own it together that system is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.090" end="00:10:24.700" style="s2">already in place in some ways in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.030" end="00:10:28.870" style="s2">corporate structure called a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.700" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">where cooperatives are owned by a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.870" end="00:10:33.650" style="s2">generally workers or consumers but</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.120" end="00:10:35.750" style="s2">there&#39;s also producer cooperatives the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.650" end="00:10:38.900" style="s2">thing I&#39;m envisioning is very much a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.750" end="00:10:41.300" style="s2">consumer cooperative so like MEK which</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.900" end="00:10:41.960" style="s2">is not gonna call up in Canada and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.300" end="00:10:43.850" style="s2">have to be a member</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.960" end="00:10:45.050" style="s2">cause five dollars then you get about in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.850" end="00:10:46.580" style="s2">the court of directors and five dollars</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.050" end="00:10:49.310" style="s2">total is what it costs to be a member if</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.580" end="00:10:51.530" style="s2">neck or credit unions which have</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.310" end="00:10:53.510" style="s2">membership so they&#39;re they&#39;re a bank</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.530" end="00:10:55.010" style="s2">that&#39;s run not-for-profit if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.510" end="00:10:56.890" style="s2">know that get on board to a credit union</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.010" end="00:10:58.850" style="s2">they might not be able to offer the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.890" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">because they&#39;re not allowed to be as big</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.850" end="00:11:02.030" style="s2">and they don&#39;t have the same rule is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:04.130" style="s2">there any was necessarily able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.030" end="00:11:05.480" style="s2">the same rates so a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.130" end="00:11:09.769" style="s2">understandably are going to go to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.480" end="00:11:11.630" style="s2">Bank but ethically credit unions are</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.769" end="00:11:13.730" style="s2">where we want them or funds to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.630" end="00:11:16.610" style="s2">because they are democratic they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.730" end="00:11:18.529" style="s2">necessarily transparent but it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.610" end="00:11:20.149" style="s2">member one vote and there&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.529" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">as they can be with the technology like</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.149" end="00:11:24.649" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re signs and all</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">transparent like a bank but they had to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.649" end="00:11:28.220" style="s2">ever compete with banks so in the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:31.730" style="s2">way they have to be anyway sidetracked</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.220" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">so yeah together we&#39;re gonna fund it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.730" end="00:11:35.480" style="s2">together we&#39;re gonna own it together</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:36.110" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna run it now that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.480" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:40.459" style="s2">current leaks we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:42.260" style="s2">technology to do that so we need to one</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.459" end="00:11:45.529" style="s2">of our first projects needs to be to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.260" end="00:11:47.060" style="s2">create the technology to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.529" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">online like that&#39;s the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.060" end="00:11:52.149" style="s2">we&#39;re creating and we&#39;re giving people</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:55.610" style="s2">access to knowledge connection and tools</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.149" end="00:11:57.740" style="s2">with so not explain it as well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.610" end="00:11:59.690" style="s2">right that&#39;s why this is week one this</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.740" end="00:12:02.329" style="s2">is faylene week one and I&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.690" end="00:12:03.500" style="s2">explaining this until there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.329" end="00:12:05.149" style="s2">people on board to understand it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.500" end="00:12:09.199" style="s2">also I have the website because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.149" end="00:12:10.279" style="s2">website explains a better chunk of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.199" end="00:12:12.019" style="s2">what it is we&#39;re trying to create and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.279" end="00:12:13.610" style="s2">this is supposed to be more FAQ more</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.019" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">like oh did you think about this and be</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.610" end="00:12:17.420" style="s2">answering the questions and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">going to become once there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.420" end="00:12:22.220" style="s2">people and interaction and enough then</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:23.540" style="s2">we can break down the tasks to get to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.220" end="00:12:28.029" style="s2">the next stage which is the crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.540" end="00:12:30.230" style="s2">stage of funding our first project and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.029" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">what we need people on board first the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.230" end="00:12:34.339" style="s2">whole idea is to create things together</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:35.959" style="s2">when it makes sense to create them it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.339" end="00:12:37.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense for me to spend my</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.959" end="00:12:39.170" style="s2">time and energy and money creating</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.970" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">something that no one&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.170" end="00:12:43.639" style="s2">interested in so if no one&#39;s interested</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.870" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">in creating a cooperative together why</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.639" end="00:12:49.699" style="s2">would I spend million dollars which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:53.990" style="s2">totally have um creating that right if I</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.699" end="00:12:56.660" style="s2">can if I can draw in and recruit enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.990" end="00:12:59.180" style="s2">people that are like take my money we</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.660" end="00:13:00.410" style="s2">need this yesterday that&#39;s what I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.180" end="00:13:02.510" style="s2">it&#39;s feasible that&#39;s what I know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.410" end="00:13:04.459" style="s2">message resonates with people enough but</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.510" end="00:13:06.949" style="s2">there isn&#39;t that risk to it it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.459" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">about risky and a million dollars it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.949" end="00:13:11.569" style="s2">about no ten thousand people a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:14.000" style="s2">thousand people each put in twenty five</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.569" end="00:13:16.459" style="s2">dollars now we have a million dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.000" end="00:13:19.220" style="s2">co-create technology to collaborate and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.459" end="00:13:21.140" style="s2">creating that transparently</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.220" end="00:13:23.150" style="s2">so that people know where their funds</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.140" end="00:13:25.160" style="s2">are going to Besser ability because</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.150" end="00:13:26.450" style="s2">again that technology doesn&#39;t exist yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.160" end="00:13:29.230" style="s2">we&#39;re creating the technology in order</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.450" end="00:13:31.490" style="s2">to be accountable to our members and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.230" end="00:13:32.870" style="s2">allow members to retain their boat and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.490" end="00:13:36.380" style="s2">not necessarily pass it on to the Board</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.870" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">of Directors but we&#39;re where we are so</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.380" end="00:13:39.800" style="s2">that technology doesn&#39;t exist yet until</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.450" end="00:13:45.650" style="s2">we create it we need to deal with what</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.800" end="00:13:46.760" style="s2">we do have yes so I did those two points</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.650" end="00:13:49.520" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.760" end="00:13:54.650" style="s2">so the idea is 10 20 years in the future</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.520" end="00:13:58.340" style="s2">after we have dozens or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.650" end="00:14:01.550" style="s2">projects we live in a different world</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.340" end="00:14:06.190" style="s2">then because when anyone can go online</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.550" end="00:14:09.080" style="s2">and easily find connection easily have</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.190" end="00:14:11.660" style="s2">information that they need to do what</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.080" end="00:14:13.280" style="s2">they&#39;re put here to do that if they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.660" end="00:14:15.230" style="s2">writing a historical novel it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.280" end="00:14:20.900" style="s2">easy because they have access to history</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.230" end="00:14:25.430" style="s2">in a way that is visual or I think of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.900" end="00:14:28.010" style="s2">kinesthetic in a way it like that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.430" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">can see oh wait I person 1800s have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.010" end="00:14:30.980" style="s2">stopwatch and stopwatches weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:33.380" style="s2">created yet like you can easily see that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.980" end="00:14:34.640" style="s2">because you can see the path I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.380" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">know and I explained that exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.640" end="00:14:40.600" style="s2">now but individuals have access to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">systems so they&#39;re paying our membership</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.600" end="00:14:47.420" style="s2">members are paying $10 per month and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">getting access to apps tons and tons and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.420" end="00:14:51.650" style="s2">dozens of apps that work together in</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.650" end="00:14:56.270" style="s2">why they&#39;re choosing to do it later on</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:57.740" style="s2">the early adopters will be wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.270" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">put money towards something or to create</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.740" end="00:15:02.060" style="s2">this vision in the future later on you</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:03.860" style="s2">don&#39;t need to see a vision of the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.060" end="00:15:05.450" style="s2">it&#39;s just like like you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.860" end="00:15:08.089" style="s2">see Netflix vision to just be like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.450" end="00:15:10.040" style="s2">entertain me you don&#39;t need to see the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.089" end="00:15:11.480" style="s2">vision of hey when we&#39;re all working</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.040" end="00:15:14.030" style="s2">together collaboratively we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.480" end="00:15:15.800" style="s2">better off because you&#39;re like no this</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.350" end="00:15:23.089" style="s2">worth of it it makes sense just like</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.540" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">that out for that and I get to vote and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.089" end="00:15:31.610" style="s2">be kept up to date on all the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:32.190" style="s2">projects sure even better so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.610" end="00:15:34.710" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.190" end="00:15:35.970" style="s2">in the future we have access to all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.710" end="00:15:38.850" style="s2">knowledge we need we have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.970" end="00:15:40.290" style="s2">tools to mitigate where we fall short so</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.850" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">if we&#39;re not great at time management we</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.290" end="00:15:44.070" style="s2">have the tools do time management to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:45.570" style="s2">project management to find the people we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.070" end="00:15:47.180" style="s2">need to collaborate with because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.570" end="00:15:50.610" style="s2">not all great at finding the people or</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.180" end="00:15:55.890" style="s2">running a group and that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.610" end="00:15:58.380" style="s2">we&#39;re not valuable contributing human</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.890" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">beings it just means we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.380" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">perfect set of skills to get an idea out</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:04.530" style="s2">there and ask those people it sucks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:06.810" style="s2">it sucks that it&#39;s hard to get an idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.530" end="00:16:08.640" style="s2">out there which is why I&#39;m going through</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.810" end="00:16:11.550" style="s2">this system to create an idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.640" end="00:16:13.620" style="s2">I mean who I don&#39;t necessarily want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.550" end="00:16:15.630" style="s2">be being more of an extrovert putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.620" end="00:16:17.670" style="s2">myself online in order to create the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.630" end="00:16:19.200" style="s2">system so nobody else has to no one else</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.670" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">should have to get a platform in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.200" end="00:16:23.940" style="s2">to create something that&#39;s gonna save us</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:25.530" style="s2">all they should just be like hey do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.940" end="00:16:26.940" style="s2">think this idea could save us all well</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.530" end="00:16:28.920" style="s2">let&#39;s look into it here&#39;s the pros</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.940" end="00:16:30.770" style="s2">here&#39;s the cons here&#39;s what how do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.920" end="00:16:33.000" style="s2">take a step forward right those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.770" end="00:16:34.650" style="s2">possibly dozens of people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.000" end="00:16:35.910" style="s2">that process of like breaking it down</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.650" end="00:16:37.320" style="s2">into components and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.910" end="00:16:39.960" style="s2">looking for I&#39;m creating with what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.320" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">creating I&#39;m creating what I would need</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.960" end="00:16:45.510" style="s2">to create this well creating without</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:47.370" style="s2">that if that makes any kind of sense so</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.510" end="00:16:49.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well if I could just go</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.370" end="00:16:50.580" style="s2">on and be like hey who wants to start I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.470" end="00:16:52.740" style="s2">mean the global cooperative if it</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.580" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">already existed be like hey who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.740" end="00:16:56.790" style="s2">start a food app like let&#39;s draw our</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:16:58.710" style="s2">permaculture app that like plans out</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.790" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">your garden tells you when to water it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.710" end="00:17:01.800" style="s2">tells you when to harvest it works with</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:06.829" style="s2">your neighbors so that you know like my</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.800" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">tomatoes are all right we have X like</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.829" end="00:17:10.439" style="s2">sky&#39;s the limit we can create whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:12.750" style="s2">we want to create as we&#39;re funding it</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.439" end="00:17:14.910" style="s2">and we&#39;re funding projects for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.750" end="00:17:18.180" style="s2">and not for profit so where it makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.910" end="00:17:20.189" style="s2">sense it doesn&#39;t make sense to spend 10</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.180" end="00:17:22.110" style="s2">million dollars on an app that one</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.189" end="00:17:23.670" style="s2">person&#39;s going to use but it does make</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.110" end="00:17:25.319" style="s2">sense to spend a million dollars on an</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.670" end="00:17:28.190" style="s2">app that a million people are gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.319" end="00:17:33.180" style="s2">to coordinate and collaborate and create</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.190" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">great amazing basic stuff so yes oh I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.180" end="00:17:38.790" style="s2">have here the kind of approach so in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:42.390" style="s2">future 10 20 years we have access to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.790" end="00:17:44.460" style="s2">history science is a big one because no</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.390" end="00:17:45.809" style="s2">matter how rich you are like Steve Jobs</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.460" end="00:17:50.129" style="s2">died of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.809" end="00:17:52.740" style="s2">you cannot buy access to innovation that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.129" end="00:17:55.830" style="s2">we don&#39;t have yet and the secretive</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.740" end="00:17:57.870" style="s2">profit driven innovation gets us</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.830" end="00:18:00.029" style="s2">somewhere but it&#39;s not the best option</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.870" end="00:18:03.059" style="s2">if we were open with our cancer research</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.029" end="00:18:04.679" style="s2">if both like when I give money to cancer</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.059" end="00:18:08.269" style="s2">research I got to see where that money</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.679" end="00:18:10.590" style="s2">actually went and it was about like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.269" end="00:18:12.809" style="s2">having less cancer when you have cancer</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.590" end="00:18:15.509" style="s2">surviving it and actually curing it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.809" end="00:18:17.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t care if that makes profit that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.509" end="00:18:19.619" style="s2">gets us better research where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.190" end="00:18:22.340" style="s2">have to wait a decade to hear about</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.619" end="00:18:24.809" style="s2">something new because a scientist has to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.340" end="00:18:26.669" style="s2">come with the idea run the accept the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.809" end="00:18:34.019" style="s2">funding for the project run the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.669" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">experiment and then publish and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.019" end="00:18:39.889" style="s2">get it it&#39;s like a 10-year process if</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:41.999" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know six seven year study and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.889" end="00:18:43.230" style="s2">instead be able to collaborate from day</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.999" end="00:18:44.940" style="s2">one you&#39;re able to troubleshoot the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.230" end="00:18:46.769" style="s2">experiment you&#39;re able to say hey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.940" end="00:18:47.970" style="s2">working on this collaborating with other</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.769" end="00:18:50.249" style="s2">people around the world that are working</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.970" end="00:18:53.129" style="s2">on it getting access right away to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.249" end="00:18:55.019" style="s2">information people&#39;s ideas if you take</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.129" end="00:18:57.210" style="s2">eco and profit out of it and instead</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.019" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">you&#39;re there to solve cancer not to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.210" end="00:19:02.610" style="s2">the person who solves cancer there could</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.080" end="00:26:26.250" style="s2">decide to have the same food system it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.490" end="00:26:39.490" style="s2">tools become more efficient and too</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.330" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">create those systems together so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.490" end="00:26:45.400" style="s2">when I want to work with my neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:46.690" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to do so because my neighbors</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.620" end="00:27:33.490" style="s2">anything and so there is no coercion and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.180" end="00:27:37.780" style="s2">there is no force everything is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.490" end="00:27:40.120" style="s2">voluntary but we create it in such like</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.780" end="00:27:42.730" style="s2">why would if you&#39;re if you are tracking</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.850" end="00:27:51.670" style="s2">waste that you never ever touched and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.770" end="00:27:54.130" style="s2">therefore maybe you shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.670" end="00:27:55.750" style="s2">bought the more you have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.130" end="00:27:58.600" style="s2">information the more you&#39;re going to be</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.600" end="00:28:03.280" style="s2">nutritious more financially stable the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:05.410" style="s2">more we then have that that system in</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.280" end="00:28:07.660" style="s2">place I kind of was talking about three</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.410" end="00:28:13.000" style="s2">different things though like if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.889" end="00:33:37.100" style="s2">when yet like there</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.210" end="00:33:39.559" style="s2">don&#39;t you think everything we make needs</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.100" end="00:33:41.620" style="s2">to be accessible to the floor to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.559" end="00:33:43.970" style="s2">accessible to people who have zero money</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.620" end="00:33:45.710" style="s2">even the $10 a month that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.970" end="00:33:51.620" style="s2">about will be there&#39;ll be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.710" end="00:33:52.879" style="s2">offset that because everyone needs so</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.620" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like you either have time or money</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.879" end="00:33:57.980" style="s2">and trading one for the other so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.409" style="s2">like okay maybe you don&#39;t do ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.980" end="00:34:03.049" style="s2">a month maybe instead you&#39;re doing 10</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.409" end="00:34:03.230" style="s2">hours of or tens that&#39;s like a dollar an</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.049" end="00:34:05.090" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.230" end="00:34:06.440" style="s2">you&#39;re doing an hour of time or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.090" end="00:34:07.970" style="s2">it happens to be or the offset and if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.440" end="00:34:09.740" style="s2">have all people doing time and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.970" end="00:34:11.569" style="s2">pain it&#39;s not gonna work everyone pain</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.740" end="00:34:13.250" style="s2">and nobody doing time that&#39;ll work a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.569" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">little better but then we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.250" end="00:34:18.290" style="s2">to pay people to do the time which means</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:21.190" style="s2">money&#39;s all being used up but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.290" end="00:34:24.649" style="s2">being used at create the technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.190" end="00:34:31.700" style="s2">creating our own little grant pool that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.649" end="00:34:33.770" style="s2">people can access through democracy you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.700" end="00:34:36.290" style="s2">have a million people paying $10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.770" end="00:34:38.569" style="s2">into a pool ten million dollars and on</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.290" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">can&#39;t do the math yes there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.569" end="00:34:43.010" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be the overhead of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:45.800" style="s2">the corporation itself the but like okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.010" end="00:34:47.329" style="s2">so a million dollars I think we can run</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.800" end="00:34:49.909" style="s2">that for a million dollars month we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.329" end="00:34:51.470" style="s2">ten million dollars nine million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.909" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">to go towards projects to creating the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.470" end="00:34:54.889" style="s2">next one and the truth is that million</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:57.380" style="s2">dollars will increase as our projects</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.889" end="00:34:59.089" style="s2">increase right if we have thousand</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.380" end="00:35:00.740" style="s2">different projects thousand different</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.089" end="00:35:02.329" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.740" end="00:35:03.530" style="s2">per project per month because the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.329" end="00:35:05.329" style="s2">point is to be more efficient so like</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.530" end="00:35:06.950" style="s2">there&#39;s one HR department one legal</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.329" end="00:35:08.089" style="s2">before it&#39;s like a legal department says</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.950" end="00:35:12.230" style="s2">we need four different countries but</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.089" end="00:35:14.569" style="s2">like there&#39;s a efficient like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.230" end="00:35:17.089" style="s2">have to everyone&#39;s are fully autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.569" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">by itself that there is a central one</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.089" end="00:35:24.319" style="s2">that&#39;s helping you with a lot of the a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:28.280" style="s2">lot of it yeah that there is what was</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.319" end="00:35:30.970" style="s2">that point about so yeah we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.280" end="00:35:32.290" style="s2">really sidetracked in it so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.970" end="00:35:35.140" style="s2">we OH</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.290" end="00:35:38.290" style="s2">compete competition because in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.140" end="00:35:40.360" style="s2">cooperative system when somebody invents</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.290" end="00:35:40.930" style="s2">it everyone gets it and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.360" end="00:35:42.970" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.930" end="00:35:45.190" style="s2">oh you invented a table now you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.970" end="00:35:46.090" style="s2">obligated to make that same table for</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.190" end="00:35:48.850" style="s2">all million bucks</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.090" end="00:35:50.890" style="s2">it means you made a table you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.850" end="00:35:53.230" style="s2">individual you get to choose if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.890" end="00:35:55.510" style="s2">share that with us you get to choose if</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.230" end="00:35:56.830" style="s2">you are gonna make them and then give</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.510" end="00:35:58.930" style="s2">them away and who can give them away -</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.830" end="00:36:00.730" style="s2">if you are giving them away you get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.930" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">choose if you&#39;re gonna give the plans to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.730" end="00:36:04.540" style="s2">people so everyone can make one if they</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:05.740" style="s2">want to like you get to choose the level</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.540" end="00:36:08.530" style="s2">but generally speaking when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.740" end="00:36:10.090" style="s2">cooperative person and you want people</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.530" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">to have access to what you created</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.090" end="00:36:14.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a system to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:16.300" style="s2">so it&#39;s not again ok now all the sudden</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.890" end="00:36:18.070" style="s2">we have a factory of tables right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.300" end="00:36:19.810" style="s2">like no there&#39;s this blueprint that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.070" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">made oh you can&#39;t do you can&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.810" end="00:36:23.380" style="s2">table for a blueprint great there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.030" style="s2">Saturday course you can take to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.380" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">that exact table because 10 other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.030" end="00:36:28.540" style="s2">have signed up and it&#39;s offered once a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:29.860" style="s2">year in your location because we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.540" end="00:36:32.760" style="s2">make sure there&#39;s the ten people to sign</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.860" end="00:36:35.560" style="s2">up and it&#39;s held at our community I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.760" end="00:36:38.710" style="s2">don&#39;t say lab but that&#39;s wrong but what</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.560" end="00:36:42.250" style="s2">working space but there&#39;s those type of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.710" end="00:36:44.080" style="s2">spaces so maybe again you might not get</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.250" end="00:36:46.870" style="s2">access to that space for free or for</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.080" end="00:36:48.670" style="s2">your ten dollars a month because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.870" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">why why is it in Vancouver and on</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.670" end="00:36:55.750" style="s2">Toronto or New York or say Bangladeshis</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:59.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a country though isn&#39;t it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.750" end="00:37:01.240" style="s2">Calcutta yeah like it&#39;s why isn&#39;t it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.250" end="00:37:03.610" style="s2">like why does he get to be here instead</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.240" end="00:37:05.350" style="s2">of there that can be the case that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.610" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">can say okay if you have a million</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.350" end="00:37:09.550" style="s2">people sign up you get into a library if</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.930" end="00:37:11.350" style="s2">you get like it&#39;s not you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.550" end="00:37:12.700" style="s2">fund it yourselves you know like we will</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.350" end="00:37:14.230" style="s2">fund it for you if you have this many</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.700" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">people sign up right there&#39;s thresholds</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.230" end="00:37:18.910" style="s2">that are met but also you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">make that threshold if you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.910" end="00:37:21.610" style="s2">thousand dedicated people together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">you&#39;re like we can do this with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.610" end="00:37:26.470" style="s2">thousand people it&#39;s made easier for you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:28.990" style="s2">still you&#39;ve had all the other people</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.470" end="00:37:30.970" style="s2">all the other cities who done it who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.990" end="00:37:34.030" style="s2">made it easier and worn the path for you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.970" end="00:37:35.980" style="s2">so it&#39;s easier for you to do it the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.030" end="00:37:37.570" style="s2">basically I don&#39;t miss it tooks when he</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.980" end="00:37:40.330" style="s2">make sounds just perfect I&#39;m sick today</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.570" end="00:37:42.460" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do another I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.330" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">every week until there&#39;s there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.460" end="00:37:49.300" style="s2">out of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:49.300" style="s2">so that we&#39;re creating the scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.570" end="00:37:56.450" style="s2">under our existing world our existing</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.480" end="00:37:58.580" style="s2">world is working its destroying us</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.450" end="00:38:01.460" style="s2">destroying our planet causing war and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.580" end="00:38:03.350" style="s2">causing but like we&#39;re alive we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.460" end="00:38:05.330" style="s2">food most of us have food in the markets</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.350" end="00:38:06.740" style="s2">or access to food somewhere we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.330" end="00:38:10.790" style="s2">starving to death except those of us</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:13.100" style="s2">that are that we don&#39;t annihilate the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.790" end="00:38:15.350" style="s2">whole system to 0 and then Creek</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.100" end="00:38:18.050" style="s2">co-create together because that is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.350" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">that is violence if you all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.050" end="00:38:23.240" style="s2">overtook our government and I was in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:25.850" style="s2">power I don&#39;t know how to get food item</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.240" end="00:38:26.900" style="s2">what if they stop working like I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.850" end="00:38:28.040" style="s2">don&#39;t not actually get the food to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.900" end="00:38:29.120" style="s2">market I don&#39;t know how the system runs</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.040" end="00:38:32.660" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they know how the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.120" end="00:38:35.830" style="s2">runs but what we need is to be able have</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.660" end="00:38:38.540" style="s2">access to that information so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.830" end="00:38:40.430" style="s2">we&#39;re we have all the systems in place</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.540" end="00:38:42.470" style="s2">that online tools exist we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.430" end="00:38:44.510" style="s2">to co-create a lot of them off the bat</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.470" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">because they&#39;re too inaccessible they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.510" end="00:38:48.110" style="s2">too expensive they don&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:49.910" style="s2">collaboration with other things but we</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.110" end="00:38:51.410" style="s2">can use them as far as we can I use</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.910" end="00:38:53.950" style="s2">Google Docs for a lot of like Google</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.410" end="00:38:56.170" style="s2">Drive sorry for a lot of things I use</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.950" end="00:38:58.730" style="s2">Facebook for a lot of things and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.170" end="00:39:00.380" style="s2">whatever tools in front of me until we</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.730" end="00:39:03.620" style="s2">can co-create something as good or</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.380" end="00:39:05.270" style="s2">better available to everyone we need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.620" end="00:39:06.770" style="s2">use what&#39;s out there and so and we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.270" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">that with everything it&#39;s like okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.770" end="00:39:11.570" style="s2">not and now I&#39;m only gonna go we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:12.890" style="s2">gonna create our own medical system I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.570" end="00:39:15.290" style="s2">only gonna go to that and only use our</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.890" end="00:39:17.870" style="s2">pharmaceuticals it&#39;s like no drugs exist</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.290" end="00:39:19.250" style="s2">pharmaceuticals exist very imperfectly I</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.870" end="00:39:23.180" style="s2">would really like to have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.250" end="00:39:25.880" style="s2">information but we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.180" end="00:39:27.290" style="s2">co-create that from day one we can have</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.880" end="00:39:28.340" style="s2">conversations about how to make our</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.290" end="00:39:30.020" style="s2">health care system better when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.340" end="00:39:32.060" style="s2">create apps to code to track our health</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:35.210" style="s2">and kind of create our own healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.060" end="00:39:36.950" style="s2">system or at least a base level like if</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.210" end="00:39:38.630" style="s2">you don&#39;t have access to a doctor we</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.950" end="00:39:43.610" style="s2">have access to this app it&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.630" end="00:39:45.610" style="s2">nothing yes we&#39;re creating the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.610" end="00:39:47.390" style="s2">scaffolding underneath because</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.610" end="00:39:49.100" style="s2">collapsing what we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.390" end="00:39:52.790" style="s2">without something to replace it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.100" end="00:39:55.250" style="s2">violent and chaotic and I would like not</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.790" end="00:39:57.430" style="s2">violence and chaos so I think most</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.250" end="00:39:59.950" style="s2">people would like not buy one seek a us</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.430" end="00:40:01.780" style="s2">and no point are we going in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.950" end="00:40:04.390" style="s2">violently taking over anything we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.780" end="00:40:09.570" style="s2">even like really legally taking over</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.390" end="00:40:13.350" style="s2">things we are asking for collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.570" end="00:40:15.640" style="s2">voluntary hours voluntary contribution</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.350" end="00:40:17.770" style="s2">would be like kind of if your government</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.640" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">was like do you want to pay taxes here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.770" end="00:40:22.300" style="s2">where they&#39;re gonna go to you pick where</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:22.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to pay them it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.300" end="00:40:26.020" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.900" end="00:40:27.820" style="s2">Thanks no all right yes to schools even</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.020" end="00:40:29.320" style="s2">if my I don&#39;t have a kid because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.820" end="00:40:32.380" style="s2">probably important it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.320" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">we get to create the scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.380" end="00:40:37.780" style="s2">underneath with tech because it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:40.840" style="s2">be the most bang for our buck and as we</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.780" end="00:40:42.190" style="s2">collect data on through tech as we</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.840" end="00:40:44.530" style="s2">collect the data on where it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.190" end="00:40:48.100" style="s2">when thresholds are met we then go off</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.530" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2">of tacking create by farms and lands and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.100" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">things that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.540" end="00:40:55.150" style="s2">in fact land might be one if sidetracked</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.140" end="00:40:57.160" style="s2">for our first Carib funding campaign</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.150" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">goes really well instead of renting a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.160" end="00:41:02.140" style="s2">house which is what I&#39;m envisioning for</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">our tech cooperative of tech people who</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.140" end="00:41:05.850" style="s2">are gonna create together and have their</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:08.530" style="s2">needs met so they can focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.850" end="00:41:10.870" style="s2">instead of creating like in renting a</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.530" end="00:41:14.920" style="s2">house for thousands of dollars month and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.870" end="00:41:17.290" style="s2">said we buy land and develop it so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.920" end="00:41:22.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like its own city its own little</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.290" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">like mini city where we have our working</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.060" end="00:41:26.140" style="s2">space we have living quarters we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:29.140" style="s2">food we like it&#39;s all there and people</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.140" end="00:41:34.120" style="s2">can come and visit and come and be a hub</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.140" end="00:41:35.860" style="s2">of creating this it&#39;s like how big that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.120" end="00:41:37.240" style="s2">can be do this depending on how much we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.860" end="00:41:39.580" style="s2">carve fun right if we crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.240" end="00:41:41.590" style="s2">million dollars we&#39;re not doing that cuz</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.580" end="00:41:43.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not enough to buy lands and create</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.590" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">it if we crowd fun if we this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.960" end="00:41:48.610" style="s2">blows up and all its like 25 million</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:52.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah we could spend 5 million</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.610" end="00:41:53.890" style="s2">of that creating a village creating</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.090" end="00:41:55.450" style="s2">something buying an old town doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.890" end="00:41:57.880" style="s2">something where it&#39;s like this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.450" end="00:42:01.450" style="s2">be your hub come and visit come and do</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.880" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">and this will be um it depends but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.450" end="00:42:05.170" style="s2">not it&#39;s like we need the 25 million to</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.310" end="00:42:08.320" style="s2">make this go it&#39;s like no what we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.170" end="00:42:09.940" style="s2">is 250,000 that&#39;s our you know that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.320" end="00:42:11.230" style="s2">know cuz it&#39;s not you actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.940" end="00:42:12.310" style="s2">need 150 thousand to create this</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.230" end="00:42:14.380" style="s2">you might be able to create it for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.310" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">hundred thousand 50 thousand especially</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.380" end="00:42:17.980" style="s2">with people offsetting it with free with</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:21.609" style="s2">free labor because they&#39;re like yes I</p>

<p begin="00:42:21.609" end="00:42:25.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the threshold of like oh that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.410" end="00:42:27.490" style="s2">means we&#39;ve had a hundred or that means</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.330" end="00:42:30.430" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a thousand people donating $25</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.490" end="00:42:32.680" style="s2">right investing $25 in this vision of</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.430" end="00:42:34.390" style="s2">the future that is what we want we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.680" end="00:42:36.580" style="s2">that hundred thousand people we want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.390" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">have we want the threshold of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.580" end="00:42:40.500" style="s2">saying yes this needs to exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:45.609" style="s2">world more than we want the money itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.500" end="00:42:46.900" style="s2">but whatever that is that we get there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.609" end="00:42:48.970" style="s2">going to be different things available</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.900" end="00:42:52.330" style="s2">so also because we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.970" end="00:42:55.450" style="s2">technology yet in place 250,000 means</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.330" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">maybe that we have a dedicated team that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.450" end="00:42:59.650" style="s2">not me because clearly I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.570" style="s2">clearly this is just a live video I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.650" end="00:43:03.640" style="s2">don&#39;t edit videos you see the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.570" end="00:43:07.150" style="s2">on my channel they&#39;re just you take you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.640" end="00:43:10.150" style="s2">pretty much live ones because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.150" end="00:43:11.530" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want to in it start with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.150" end="00:43:13.270" style="s2">my brains power to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.530" end="00:43:14.859" style="s2">should be and shouldn&#39;t be in there and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.270" end="00:43:18.310" style="s2">it takes too much for me so I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.859" end="00:43:20.530" style="s2">it and that&#39;s fine because my passion</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.310" end="00:43:22.359" style="s2">isn&#39;t to make videos my passion is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.530" end="00:43:24.359" style="s2">create this in the world if this already</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.359" end="00:43:26.680" style="s2">existed I would be spending my days</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.359" end="00:43:28.450" style="s2">waking up when I thought of a tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.680" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">project would be like whoa who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.450" end="00:43:33.460" style="s2">make this with me and even less like</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:35.170" style="s2">maybe I that&#39;s all I want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.460" end="00:43:37.150" style="s2">create like this spark of an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.170" end="00:43:38.619" style="s2">pass it off to other people if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.150" end="00:43:40.180" style="s2">other people to pass it off to because</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.619" end="00:43:41.859" style="s2">other people that&#39;s they&#39;re like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.180" end="00:43:44.830" style="s2">know how to do tag but I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.859" end="00:43:45.640" style="s2">idea I don&#39;t have you know like be who</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.830" end="00:43:48.340" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.640" end="00:43:49.750" style="s2">create what you want to create in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.340" end="00:43:53.380" style="s2">way you want to create it those tools</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.750" end="00:43:56.859" style="s2">are in place to do that we unlock so</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.380" end="00:43:58.150" style="s2">much human potential in that way that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.859" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what the world could</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.150" end="00:44:02.230" style="s2">look like like if everyone&#39;s empowered</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:03.700" style="s2">to be their best self medicine you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.230" end="00:44:06.430" style="s2">her best self every day just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.700" end="00:44:08.830" style="s2">working towards more patients and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.430" end="00:44:11.560" style="s2">understanding and more but you are where</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.830" end="00:44:13.900" style="s2">you are and yeah so try to explain</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.560" end="00:44:17.140" style="s2">everything we&#39;re talking to myself for</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.900" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">an hour live video with no one having</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.140" end="00:44:22.450" style="s2">been present but hey it&#39;s also awesome</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:25.029" style="s2">so creating the scaffolding running a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.450" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">parallel system beside the current</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.029" end="00:44:32.109" style="s2">capitalist one so that there are two</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:34.479" style="s2">systems and if the idea is this one is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.109" end="00:44:35.709" style="s2">voluntary and as people opt-in it gives</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.479" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">us more and more power more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.709" end="00:44:40.299" style="s2">money to grow more and more things to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:41.799" style="s2">and you can be part of both on paying</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.299" end="00:44:43.719" style="s2">taxes in this one because it&#39;s legal</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.799" end="00:44:46.749" style="s2">right like it&#39;s like you have to be part</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.719" end="00:44:48.609" style="s2">of both but eventually if this one does</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.749" end="00:44:52.809" style="s2">what it&#39;s supposed to do and outcompetes</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.609" end="00:44:54.789" style="s2">the competition version the competition</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.809" end="00:44:56.919" style="s2">can&#39;t really exist when there&#39;s only 1%</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.789" end="00:44:58.509" style="s2">of the people doing it there&#39;s only 1%</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.919" end="00:45:02.499" style="s2">of the people who are living in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.509" end="00:45:04.509" style="s2">capitalism capitalism doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.499" end="00:45:06.069" style="s2">capitalism is exploitive especially when</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.509" end="00:45:08.169" style="s2">you offer the people who are being</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.069" end="00:45:08.919" style="s2">exploited another alternative it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.499" end="00:45:57.159" style="s2">contribute and then creating the tools</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.819" end="00:45:58.749" style="s2">to be able to do that for everyone not</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.159" end="00:46:00.429" style="s2">just for me not just because my brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.749" end="00:46:02.919" style="s2">works this way and I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.429" end="00:46:04.630" style="s2">create the tools that help me get my</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.349" end="00:46:12.519" style="s2">greatest in those areas to create an app</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.939" end="00:46:15.339" style="s2">that works for a hundred different</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.519" end="00:46:16.689" style="s2">people its finances are horrible right</p>

<p begin="00:46:18.849" end="00:46:25.179" style="s2">works for those hunter it&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.259" end="00:46:26.589" style="s2">work for the million yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.179" end="00:46:27.819" style="s2">being efficient because we&#39;re not having</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.589" end="00:46:29.169" style="s2">to recreate everything every time you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.819" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">don&#39;t to figure out the funding for your</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.169" end="00:46:32.469" style="s2">project because the funding here already</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:33.669" style="s2">exists you&#39;d have to convince the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.469" end="00:46:35.769" style="s2">funders which is kind of the current</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.669" end="00:46:38.469" style="s2">system but in a way that&#39;s open and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.769" end="00:46:38.900" style="s2">democratic where it&#39;s like okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.469" end="00:46:40.549" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.900" end="00:46:43.609" style="s2">Vincente of people that your app is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.549" end="00:46:45.109" style="s2">worthy of funds then it&#39;s not worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.609" end="00:46:46.220" style="s2">the funds like it&#39;s like okay if they</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.109" end="00:46:47.660" style="s2">aren&#39;t getting enough people to you if</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.220" end="00:46:49.549" style="s2">it costs a hundred million dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.660" end="00:46:52.359" style="s2">make it and there&#39;s a dozen people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.549" end="00:46:54.410" style="s2">want to use it that&#39;s not a that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.359" end="00:46:55.880" style="s2">there may be times where that makes</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.410" end="00:46:58.220" style="s2">sense for us to do because it&#39;s a life</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.880" end="00:47:00.260" style="s2">saving for those twelve people maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.220" end="00:47:04.670" style="s2">do it then as a group and we say yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.260" end="00:47:07.460" style="s2">those people&#39;s life it&#39;s worth that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.670" end="00:47:09.529" style="s2">we don&#39;t do that just cuz hey I won I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.460" end="00:47:12.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know to go fishing and this exact</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.529" end="00:47:13.339" style="s2">apps very very particular and no one</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.020" end="00:47:15.890" style="s2">else can use it except these 12 people</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.339" end="00:47:17.059" style="s2">Oh get it if you&#39;re taking a fishing app</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.890" end="00:47:21.260" style="s2">and there&#39;s all the fishermen out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.059" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">for sure people who am like yeah I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.260" end="00:47:25.490" style="s2">that that&#39;s awesome that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:27.619" style="s2">the thresholds already there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.490" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">already giving you their vote then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.619" end="00:47:31.970" style="s2">they get to you and that gets created so</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:35.660" style="s2">the funding doesn&#39;t have to be thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.970" end="00:47:38.440" style="s2">of every time you don&#39;t have to with</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.660" end="00:47:41.210" style="s2">funding very intimately tied is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.440" end="00:47:43.220" style="s2">threshold of usability if you need</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.210" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s so many great projects out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.220" end="00:47:46.369" style="s2">but they don&#39;t have enough people</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:48.670" style="s2">knowing about them in order to make the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.369" end="00:47:51.289" style="s2">threshold to make it usable like um</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.670" end="00:47:53.660" style="s2">Craigslist is an amazing website</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.289" end="00:47:55.220" style="s2">especially for when it was created it</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.660" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">gives people knowledgeable more</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.970" end="00:49:11.570" style="s2">thousand votes so when I vote it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.860" end="00:49:16.730" style="s2">ten right like it&#39;s not one number one</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.110" end="00:49:18.020" style="s2">vote on the board because each chord</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.730" end="00:49:20.060" style="s2">member has a different number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.020" end="00:49:21.350" style="s2">Delegates under them people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.060" end="00:49:24.920" style="s2">definitely give it a book to them a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.350" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">member in good standing and so democracy</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.920" end="00:49:30.680" style="s2">is an important piece of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:33.950" style="s2">transparency in order to be democratic</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.680" end="00:49:35.450" style="s2">in order to be able to expect people to</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.950" end="00:49:36.560" style="s2">vote on issues whether themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.450" end="00:49:38.510" style="s2">delegating it to someone else that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.560" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">delegate that board director is still</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.510" end="00:49:41.990" style="s2">gonna have to okay their decisions to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">their members are still gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.990" end="00:49:45.830" style="s2">like well the reason I voted this way in</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:48.500" style="s2">order to be able to do that they need</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.830" end="00:49:49.850" style="s2">access to information so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.500" end="00:49:51.830" style="s2">there is no hierarchy of information</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.850" end="00:49:54.020" style="s2">everything that&#39;s available to the CEO</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.830" end="00:49:55.550" style="s2">is available to every member all</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.020" end="00:49:58.010" style="s2">information because that gives us so</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.550" end="00:49:59.930" style="s2">much power and protection you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.010" end="00:50:02.630" style="s2">someone come and talk to the CEO and say</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.930" end="00:50:05.000" style="s2">oh we actually are just gonna amalgamate</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.630" end="00:50:06.200" style="s2">all all of your information from your</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.000" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">members you have to give that to us</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.200" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">because there is no it&#39;s like cool I</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.150" style="s2">have to put that to a vote or even if</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not up for vote because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.150" end="00:50:15.010" style="s2">legal matter I have to tell my members</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.670" end="00:50:17.690" style="s2">just like I would have to tell my board</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.010" end="00:50:20.660" style="s2">the membership is our board right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.690" end="00:50:22.660" style="s2">we have an actual board it functions as</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.660" end="00:50:24.590" style="s2">a board to move things forward but</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.660" end="00:50:26.330" style="s2">transparency and information the only</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.590" end="00:50:27.890" style="s2">way we&#39;re not transparent information is</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.330" end="00:50:30.320" style="s2">where we join the technology yet and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.890" end="00:50:32.300" style="s2">where it doesn&#39;t make sense to do so in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.320" end="00:50:35.120" style="s2">which case we&#39;re transparent about not</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.300" end="00:50:36.710" style="s2">being transparent okay this is security</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.120" end="00:50:38.690" style="s2">matter we voted on it this group of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.710" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">people is our security team they have</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.690" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">access to that information but other</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:46.070" style="s2">people do not diversity diversity is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:49.070" style="s2">very important point because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.070" end="00:50:50.810" style="s2">fuel that drives everything it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.070" end="00:50:52.550" style="s2">makes this function is that we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.810" end="00:50:53.750" style="s2">all the same we all have different</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.550" end="00:50:55.160" style="s2">interests we all have different things</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.750" end="00:50:57.440" style="s2">when we want to geek out we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.160" end="00:50:59.600" style="s2">different skills to give we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.440" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">different limitations and so creating a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.600" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">system that harnesses that diversity</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:08.200" style="s2">instead of just like giving it false</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:09.640" style="s2">like okay well we have this many of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.200" end="00:51:12.670" style="s2">gender and this funny of this gender</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.640" end="00:51:14.230" style="s2">this is like okay I don&#39;t like can a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.670" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">person show up and whatever gender</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.230" end="00:51:20.130" style="s2">expression they have and find their</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:23.370" style="s2">place including people who are very like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.130" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">this female feminine and cisnet men</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.370" end="00:51:29.230" style="s2">masculine like people who are the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:30.700" style="s2">old wait like the over time the one</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.230" end="00:51:33.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve always known those people get to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.700" end="00:51:36.130" style="s2">exist too you don&#39;t have to be like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.610" end="00:51:39.490" style="s2">know gender-fluid hillary to be part it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.130" end="00:51:41.500" style="s2">becomes the diversity is what we tap</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.490" end="00:51:43.930" style="s2">into and it&#39;s true diversity it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.500" end="00:51:45.700" style="s2">okay if all of your boxes make you who</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.930" end="00:51:47.500" style="s2">you are we need room for all of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.700" end="00:51:50.080" style="s2">boxes your race your gender your age</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.500" end="00:51:51.610" style="s2">you&#39;re all of it without the ageism</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.080" end="00:51:52.630" style="s2">racism and everything associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.610" end="00:51:54.100" style="s2">but there&#39;s gonna be people who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.630" end="00:51:56.200" style="s2">those things because they exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.100" end="00:51:57.820" style="s2">world we need to make room for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.200" end="00:51:59.830" style="s2">people that exist without the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.820" end="00:52:04.090" style="s2">that we just like there&#39;s ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.830" end="00:52:05.140" style="s2">that cooperation is a big value it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.090" end="00:52:08.710" style="s2">like the whole thing the whole thing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.140" end="00:52:10.270" style="s2">based on but the beauty is because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.710" end="00:52:12.510" style="s2">starting where we&#39;re starting the early</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.270" end="00:52:14.650" style="s2">adopters are gonna be our co-operators</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.510" end="00:52:17.350" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be people who are putting</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:20.440" style="s2">their money where their mouth is saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.350" end="00:52:21.550" style="s2">and being like yes take my money so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.440" end="00:52:24.690" style="s2">can create this together even if they</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.550" end="00:52:27.220" style="s2">never put another hour into it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.690" end="00:52:29.380" style="s2">that&#39;s enough putting the $10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.220" end="00:52:31.450" style="s2">into it say are the $25 per project in</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.380" end="00:52:33.640" style="s2">the beginning is being the uber</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.450" end="00:52:34.810" style="s2">cooperator it&#39;s saying yes I see the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.640" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">vision I want to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.810" end="00:52:38.260" style="s2">I wanted platform I can call I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:41.470" style="s2">cooperate with people on cooperation is</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.260" end="00:52:43.120" style="s2">a big value one of the other values</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.470" end="00:52:45.720" style="s2">which is not the top four or like</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.120" end="00:52:48.490" style="s2">fundamental we cannot do this without it</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.720" end="00:52:50.320" style="s2">the fifth one is a little more Wiggly a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.490" end="00:52:52.570" style="s2">little more like okay this wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.320" end="00:52:55.810" style="s2">then I guess I&#39;d still be a part but it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.570" end="00:52:57.790" style="s2">makes it so much easier better faster to</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.750" end="00:56:08.760" style="s2">system for the co-operators we take over</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.900" end="00:56:10.770" style="s2">from the competitors because cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.760" end="00:56:12.900" style="s2">kicks competitions ass every time you</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.770" end="00:56:14.760" style="s2">need you have everyone out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.900" end="00:56:18.810" style="s2">competing over like who&#39;s gonna make the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.760" end="00:56:21.150" style="s2">best mug one person a cooperator 3d</p>

<p begin="00:56:21.150" end="00:56:25.890" style="s2">know work it out competitions done and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.900" end="00:56:28.470" style="s2">as one person goes a little but I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.890" end="00:56:30.300" style="s2">an even better mug rate someone else</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.300" end="00:56:35.099" style="s2">now like it&#39;s like you the comp the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.369" end="00:56:36.990" style="s2">cooperation with technology outcompetes</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.099" end="00:56:40.349" style="s2">competition because the competition is</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.990" end="00:56:42.270" style="s2">it&#39;s is old I mean so it&#39;s cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.349" end="00:56:45.300" style="s2">but like it&#39;s it&#39;s what we have and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.270" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">keeps innovation from happening in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.300" end="00:56:49.380" style="s2">of ways and we&#39;re harnessing the the</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.380" end="00:56:53.220" style="s2">I&#39;d explain it but like we create for</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.690" end="00:56:56.070" style="s2">purpose instead of profit and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.220" end="00:56:57.510" style="s2">cooperate we naturally take over from</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.070" end="00:56:59.630" style="s2">capitalism because capitalism can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.510" end="00:57:02.250" style="s2">exist in it if you had 10 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.630" end="00:57:03.900" style="s2">create a door-to-door delivery service</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.250" end="00:57:07.550" style="s2">with our own goods and services that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.900" end="00:57:10.080" style="s2">like people made out of their houses and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.550" end="00:57:13.170" style="s2">bulk buying what&#39;s already available in</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.080" end="00:57:15.450" style="s2">from from corporations and then delivery</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.170" end="00:57:17.580" style="s2">them and we created that system and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.450" end="00:57:19.260" style="s2">hundred million people opted into using</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.580" end="00:57:22.800" style="s2">that system and it&#39;s better faster</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.260" end="00:57:24.330" style="s2">cheaper then Amazon how the Sun Goes</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.800" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">Away we don&#39;t have to have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.330" end="00:57:27.690" style="s2">of whether they&#39;re paying their workers</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:32.940" style="s2">well because they don&#39;t exist if we</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.690" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">don&#39;t give them our money and we can do</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.940" end="00:57:36.780" style="s2">that with every single field we can do</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:38.910" style="s2">that with every single industry like</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.780" end="00:57:41.810" style="s2">competition doesn&#39;t work in corporations</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.910" end="00:57:44.820" style="s2">involved because competition can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.810" end="00:57:47.430" style="s2">compete with cooperation cooperation can</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.820" end="00:57:50.279" style="s2">absolutely out-compete competition</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.430" end="00:57:53.670" style="s2">and so yeah that&#39;s been kind of the gist</p>
