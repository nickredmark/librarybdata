<p begin="00:00:12.510" end="00:00:16.920" style="s2">it&#39;s part of our nature to be possessed</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.550" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">by this question and so you can think</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">about this as an archetypal question if</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:24.950" style="s2">if you like and the question is what are</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">we doing here</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.950" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">and you can ask yourself that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">relationship to this conference you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:35.460" style="s2">here to search for meaning and to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">understand what that might mean but you</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.460" end="00:00:41.970" style="s2">also might ask yourself well why is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">that you have to be here for your search</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.970" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">for meaning why is that something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">drives human beings it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:48.839" style="s2">characteristic for example of animals</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">they don&#39;t seem to question their</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.839" end="00:00:54.629" style="s2">existence and so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:58.769" style="s2">the very nature of human being that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.629" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">makes us feel as if something needs to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.769" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">be set right when that&#39;s being discussed</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">historically it&#39;s been associated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:12.690" style="s2">the term Redemption people are in need</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">of redemption in the modern age we talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.690" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">about positive psychology and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">about happiness which is a much weaker</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:26.219" style="s2">word but our forefathers had a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">profound sense of the problematic state</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.219" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">of human existence and they use more</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:38.399" style="s2">a need for redemption is a more profound</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">idea human beings and I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.399" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">mostly about human beings in the West</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">because that&#39;s the literature that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">most familiar with human beings in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">West have been meditating on the nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">of human being for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">perhaps ever since we became self</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">conscious which is another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">distinguishes us from animals and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:04.039" style="s2">another thing that drives our search for</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">meaning the consequence of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.039" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">meditation or one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">this meditation has been the production</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:16.250" style="s2">of a series of books that people know as</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:18.990" style="s2">the Bible I realize years ago that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.250" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">people saw the world through lenses of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.990" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">belief and more recently it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">demonstrated that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">inevitable the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">because you&#39;re a limited cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">processor you have to frame your</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:38.340" style="s2">perceptions with beliefs what I learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">is that the belief systems that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.340" end="00:02:42.060" style="s2">use to frame their perceptions have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">structure and that structure is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.060" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">religious it&#39;s a religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">presupposition is one that you you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:51.720" style="s2">even know not notice that you make it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">a it&#39;s a predicate or an axiom or an</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.720" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">assumption and the study of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:03:02.040" style="s2">axiomatic assumptions is what religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:05.880" style="s2">is about and one of your axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.040" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">assumptions for example is that life</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.880" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">involves a search for meaning and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:12.840" style="s2">associated with the idea of redemption</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">and you you&#39;ll notice that you asked</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.840" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">that question because of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:18.600" style="s2">here but you might not notice how</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">strange it is that all of you asked that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">question and the fact that all of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:24.690" style="s2">asked that question that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:27.540" style="s2">have asked that question for as far back</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.690" end="00:03:29.030" style="s2">as we can understand is indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">something profound about human nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.030" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">its lack of completion now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">walk you through the series of stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">that make up this library of books known</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:48.360" style="s2">as the Bible because it presents a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:51.170" style="s2">theory of redemption that in a sense is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.360" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">emergent it&#39;s a consequence of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.170" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">insanely complicated cross generational</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">meditation on the nature of being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">not designed by any one person it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.239" style="s2">designed by processes that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:10.829" style="s2">really understand because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.239" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">anything about how books are written</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.829" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">over thousands of years or what forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">caused them to be compiled in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">way or what narrative direction they</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">tend to take now one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">that&#39;s strange about the Bible given</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">that it&#39;s a collection of books is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:27.390" style="s2">it actually has a narrative structure it</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">has a story and that story&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.390" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">cobbled together it&#39;s like it&#39;s emerged</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:34.919" style="s2">out of the depths it&#39;s not a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:36.570" style="s2">story it&#39;s a bottom-up story then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.919" end="00:04:38.430" style="s2">suppose that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.570" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">many of the world&#39;s major religions</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.430" end="00:04:41.880" style="s2">regard the Bible as a book that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">revealed rather than one that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.880" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">written it&#39;s a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.660" end="00:04:48.510" style="s2">presupposition that it&#39;s revealed</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.510" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">work of any one author it&#39;s not written</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.820" end="00:04:56.730" style="s2">according to a plan or not a plan that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:59.100" style="s2">we can understand but nonetheless it has</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.730" end="00:05:00.930" style="s2">a structure it also has a strange</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.100" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">structuring that it&#39;s full of stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.930" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">that no one can forget but that also</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">that no one can understand and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">combination of incomprehensible and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:10.530" style="s2">unforgettable is a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">combination and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.530" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2">combination is basically mythological so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:20.820" style="s2">I&#39;m going to start out by telling you my</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">genesis has to say about why it is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.820" end="00:05:27.300" style="s2">you need to search for meaning now</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:29.250" style="s2">people are pretty familiar as a general</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.300" end="00:05:32.570" style="s2">rule with basic stories in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.250" end="00:05:38.430" style="s2">Genesis starts out with the Word of God</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.570" end="00:05:40.290" style="s2">creating being from chaos that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">complicated idea the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.290" end="00:05:45.270" style="s2">whatever the word is which is logos from</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">a from a Christian perspective from a</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:53.880" style="s2">something like speech has the power to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.510" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">pull order out of an underlying chaos</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.880" end="00:05:57.210" style="s2">now we do this all the time people do</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">this all the time that&#39;s I suppose in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.210" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">some sense why we&#39;re hypothetically made</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">in the image of God we use our</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.910" end="00:06:12.600" style="s2">something about that that&#39;s akin to the</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.600" end="00:06:18.810" style="s2">that from the perspective of this book</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.090" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">place and human beings in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.670" end="00:06:29.790" style="s2">parties participate in that in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.500" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">minor sense I suppose but in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.790" end="00:06:34.350" style="s2">that none nonetheless makes them akin to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:41.240" style="s2">what the library of books called the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.350" end="00:06:45.480" style="s2">Bible assumes his deity and once God</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.240" end="00:06:47.940" style="s2">logos extracts order out of chaos he</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.480" end="00:06:48.689" style="s2">builds a little world and he populates</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.689" end="00:06:52.679" style="s2">and then in the little world he puts a</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.679" end="00:06:56.849" style="s2">because paradise means walled garden or</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.539" end="00:06:59.699" style="s2">Eden and Eden means well watered place</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.849" end="00:07:01.709" style="s2">and you might think well why a garden</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.699" end="00:07:03.899" style="s2">and the answer to that is a garden is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.709" end="00:07:07.049" style="s2">the optimal combination of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.899" end="00:07:08.939" style="s2">culture or chaos and order because a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.049" end="00:07:11.279" style="s2">garden is where nature flourishes but</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.939" end="00:07:14.699" style="s2">it&#39;s also where nature flourishes in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.279" end="00:07:16.409" style="s2">in a safe and controlled environment so</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.699" end="00:07:19.079" style="s2">that&#39;s like an optimal environment for</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.409" end="00:07:22.279" style="s2">people and so there&#39;s a garden God puts</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.079" end="00:07:24.839" style="s2">the people in there and that&#39;s optimal</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.279" end="00:07:27.389" style="s2">when he warns them he says this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.839" end="00:07:29.459" style="s2">strange thing he says well now you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.389" end="00:07:31.559" style="s2">the garden that&#39;s where you should live</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.459" end="00:07:35.009" style="s2">and there&#39;s something you shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.559" end="00:07:39.569" style="s2">and what you should do is eat a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.009" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">particular fruit now I&#39;m going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.569" end="00:07:47.639" style="s2">you something about vision human beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:48.329" style="s2">have excellent vision first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.639" end="00:07:50.519" style="s2">see color</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.329" end="00:07:53.399" style="s2">hardly any creatures see color but we do</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.519" end="00:07:56.459" style="s2">and not only do we see color but our</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.399" end="00:07:58.139" style="s2">vision is tremendously acute the only</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.459" end="00:08:01.409" style="s2">other animals that can see as well as us</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.139" end="00:08:04.079" style="s2">are birds of prey for mammals man we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.409" end="00:08:07.229" style="s2">see like you wouldn&#39;t believe and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.079" end="00:08:08.759" style="s2">and for primates as well as we can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.229" end="00:08:11.879" style="s2">much better than our closest primate</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.759" end="00:08:13.699" style="s2">relatives and why that is is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.879" end="00:08:15.899" style="s2">mystery but there&#39;s a woman in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.699" end="00:08:17.579" style="s2">California who seems perhaps to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.899" end="00:08:19.769" style="s2">solved that her name is Lin Isabel and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.579" end="00:08:22.860" style="s2">she was very interested in how human</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.769" end="00:08:25.189" style="s2">beings developed vision and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.860" end="00:08:27.989" style="s2">interested in patterns of predation</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.189" end="00:08:31.409" style="s2">predator-prey relationships and she knew</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.989" end="00:08:34.259" style="s2">that our tree dwelling ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.409" end="00:08:37.469" style="s2">millions of years ago were frequently</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.259" end="00:08:39.089" style="s2">preyed upon by snakes in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.469" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">some evidence that our tree dwelling</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.089" end="00:08:44.850" style="s2">ancestors and snakes Cole evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:46.680" style="s2">that our visual system is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.850" end="00:08:48.750" style="s2">good at picking up the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.680" end="00:08:52.920" style="s2">camouflage that snakes used to hide in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.750" end="00:08:55.620" style="s2">trees or in the undergrowth and what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.920" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">Bell showed was that if you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.620" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">primate populations around the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.389" end="00:09:04.840" style="s2">where there were more predatory snakes</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.380" end="00:09:07.540" style="s2">the primates could see better it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.840" end="00:09:08.890" style="s2">very high correlation and so she</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.540" end="00:09:11.230" style="s2">concluded that the reason that human</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.890" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">beings can see so well is because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.230" end="00:09:15.580" style="s2">snakes</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:19.350" style="s2">now she thought the association between</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.580" end="00:09:23.530" style="s2">that and the snake story in Genesis was</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.350" end="00:09:25.900" style="s2">interestingly coincidental but it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.530" end="00:09:27.610" style="s2">more than that you know we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.900" end="00:09:29.320" style="s2">how the Adam and Eve story came about we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.610" end="00:09:31.870" style="s2">know it&#39;s very ancient but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.320" end="00:09:33.370" style="s2">something about it that sticks in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.870" end="00:09:34.930" style="s2">memory and in our culture and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.370" end="00:09:36.370" style="s2">for that seems to be that in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.930" end="00:09:42.780" style="s2">strange way it&#39;s an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.370" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">accurate summation snakes gave us vision</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.780" end="00:09:48.610" style="s2">what about fruit now the reason we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:52.930" style="s2">see colors is because our visual system</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.610" end="00:09:58.150" style="s2">evolved to detect ripe fruit what about</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.930" end="00:10:01.810" style="s2">women well you have to be pretty wait</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.150" end="00:10:05.370" style="s2">code smart a woman so there&#39;s this weird</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:09.850" style="s2">interconnection in Genesis between women</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.370" end="00:10:11.860" style="s2">fruit and snakes an idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.850" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">interplay between the three remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.860" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">women are gatherers - or were gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:18.670" style="s2">historically speaking and they shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:20.140" style="s2">food with men and that&#39;s a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.670" end="00:10:22.810" style="s2">because human being share food and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.140" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">hardly any other animals do and so women</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.810" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">did tempt men with fruit and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:30.970" style="s2">make them self-conscious along with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:34.420" style="s2">Nathan the fruit and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.970" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">catastrophe what happens in Genesis is</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:39.190" style="s2">that when people become self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.780" style="s2">when they eat the fruit their vision</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.190" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">improves the scales fall from their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.780" end="00:10:44.010" style="s2">and all of a sudden they can see in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:46.120" style="s2">way that no other animal has ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.010" end="00:10:50.500" style="s2">and one of the things they can see is</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:53.110" style="s2">that they&#39;re naked and that that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.500" end="00:10:54.670" style="s2">problem and you might ask well what does</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.110" end="00:10:56.920" style="s2">being naked mean and that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.670" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">straightforward people often dream for</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.920" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">example of being naked in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:02.650" style="s2">crowd and to be naked in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">crowd is to have all your frailties and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.650" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">vulnerabilities revealed to judgment</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:12.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a nightmare for people and so to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">become self-aware is to wake up into a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.730" end="00:11:17.700" style="s2">nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:21.570" style="s2">and the nightmare involves two profound</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.700" end="00:11:24.660" style="s2">realization of individual vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.570" end="00:11:27.209" style="s2">and the consequence of that in genesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.660" end="00:11:30.630" style="s2">is that people are banished from</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.209" end="00:11:33.329" style="s2">paradise and are from then on in need of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.630" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">redemption and that they have to work</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.329" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s how man comes to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:40.860" style="s2">fallen state and you don&#39;t have a need</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">for redemption or need for meaning your</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.860" end="00:11:46.829" style="s2">request after meaning unless you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:48.779" style="s2">fallen state and everyone strangely</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.829" end="00:11:50.490" style="s2">enough has this intuition that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.779" end="00:11:51.720" style="s2">in a fallen state that something is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.490" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">wrong with the world that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.720" end="00:11:54.899" style="s2">put right and more than that or</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:57.240" style="s2">something is wrong with being it needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.899" end="00:11:59.910" style="s2">to be put right and more than that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.240" end="00:12:02.310" style="s2">in some weird sense weird way they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.910" end="00:12:05.430" style="s2">a moral obligation to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.310" end="00:12:07.980" style="s2">that process and that drives us like</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.430" end="00:12:11.100" style="s2">it&#39;s beneath what drives us it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.980" end="00:12:15.060" style="s2">axiomatic presupposition the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.100" end="00:12:17.880" style="s2">that happens in Genesis is that Abel and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.060" end="00:12:23.010" style="s2">Cain are born and they&#39;re really the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.880" end="00:12:24.570" style="s2">first two human beings because Adam and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.010" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">Eve are made by God where&#39;s Kane and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.570" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">Abel are born there they&#39;re the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:31.980" style="s2">people that are born in history and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.680" style="s2">interestingly enough what happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.980" end="00:12:37.230" style="s2">between Cain and Abel which is jealous</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.680" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">resentment against God followed by</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.230" end="00:12:42.209" style="s2">murder is the first pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.670" style="s2">that human beings manifest once they</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.209" end="00:12:47.579" style="s2">become self conscious that&#39;s an awful</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.670" end="00:12:49.140" style="s2">story and it&#39;s a prototypical story in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.579" end="00:12:51.750" style="s2">sense because what it says is that there</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.140" end="00:12:54.510" style="s2">are two patterns of reaction to tragic</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.750" end="00:12:56.610" style="s2">self consciousness and one is associated</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.510" end="00:12:59.970" style="s2">with a murderous state of resentment</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.610" end="00:13:01.410" style="s2">resentment towards life the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.970" end="00:13:04.440" style="s2">murderous resentment that drove the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.410" end="00:13:08.180" style="s2">killer in Colorado for example murderous</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.029" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">so what happens is that as soon as</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:32.370" style="s2">divides into</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.370" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">end in heaven on another and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:42.150" style="s2">we hinted at in the in a second story in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:45.810" style="s2">Genesis after that everything dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.150" end="00:13:47.880" style="s2">into a flood that&#39;s Noah into a flood</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.810" end="00:13:50.130" style="s2">nature comes in tears everything down</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.880" end="00:13:52.230" style="s2">and the Tower of Babel is erected and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.130" end="00:13:54.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a meditation on pride people</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.030" end="00:22:19.900" style="s2">attention so for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.309" end="00:22:21.309" style="s2">having a conversation with your wife or</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.900" end="00:22:29.260" style="s2">take your viewpoint and you can impose</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.340" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">it on that person and often when people</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.679" end="00:22:36.010" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is attempting to</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.920" end="00:23:04.750" style="s2">talking to might tell you something you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.110" end="00:23:06.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know but in order to listen you</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.750" end="00:23:08.110" style="s2">have to be already convinced that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.820" end="00:23:10.210" style="s2">little theory that you&#39;re using to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.110" end="00:23:11.800" style="s2">orient yourself in the world isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.210" end="00:23:14.380" style="s2">enough because if it was good enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.800" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">then why would you bother listening so</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.380" end="00:23:17.410" style="s2">you have to be deeply aware of your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:19.330" style="s2">ignorance and that&#39;s what humility means</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.410" end="00:23:21.070" style="s2">humility means to be deeply aware of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.330" end="00:23:24.280" style="s2">your own ignorance it doesn&#39;t mean to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.070" end="00:23:26.170" style="s2">slink around in a shamed manner it means</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.280" end="00:23:27.640" style="s2">to make the presupposition that you may</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.170" end="00:23:29.290" style="s2">still have something left to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:31.690" style="s2">that this annoying person in front of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.290" end="00:23:35.559" style="s2">you might have something to teach you if</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.690" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">you would just listen and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.559" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">discussing a problem and a problem is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:42.130" style="s2">time when the things you think aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:44.110" style="s2">working that&#39;s what constitutes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.130" end="00:23:45.610" style="s2">problem so you have a little problem and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.110" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">you&#39;re discussing it let&#39;s say with your</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.610" end="00:23:52.059" style="s2">wife and she offers you her opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:54.490" style="s2">you can brush it off and in which case</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.059" end="00:23:55.870" style="s2">your little state stays intact it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.490" end="00:23:57.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t move it&#39;s still made out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.870" end="00:24:00.670" style="s2">stone it&#39;s pillars and you&#39;re still a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.940" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">tyrant or you can listen you can think</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.670" end="00:24:05.950" style="s2">oh I see there&#39;s a micro correction that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:07.390" style="s2">I need to make in one of the peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.950" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">elements of my belief and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.390" end="00:24:09.460" style="s2">little painful</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:12.250" style="s2">because it means you have to let</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.460" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">something go your your presumption and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.250" end="00:24:16.090" style="s2">then you have to be a little chaotic as</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:18.039" style="s2">you adjust to the new information and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.090" end="00:24:21.490" style="s2">then you have to reconstitute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.039" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">and what that means interestingly enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.490" end="00:24:26.620" style="s2">is that you have to make a sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:28.840" style="s2">godlike sacrifices especially if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.620" end="00:24:30.580" style="s2">of the proper kind and the proper kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.840" end="00:24:32.350" style="s2">of sacrifice is the one that you made of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.580" end="00:24:34.659" style="s2">your micro belief when you&#39;re faced with</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.350" end="00:24:37.990" style="s2">evidence of error and if you make those</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.659" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">sorts of micro sacrifices then God stays</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.990" end="00:24:41.649" style="s2">pleased with you and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">is that your models of the world stay up</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.649" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">to date now one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:46.870" style="s2">happens in the Old Testament all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:48.820" style="s2">time is that people are making</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.870" end="00:24:51.309" style="s2">sacrifices to God and modern people they</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.820" end="00:24:55.990" style="s2">just have no idea what like why does God</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.309" end="00:24:57.970" style="s2">want burnt lamb smoke it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.990" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">obvious to modern people but you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.970" end="00:25:02.740" style="s2">your ancestors weren&#39;t stupid</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:04.210" style="s2">they were dramatizing something they</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:06.940" style="s2">were dramatizing this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.210" end="00:25:09.519" style="s2">realization that no other creature has</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.940" end="00:25:12.490" style="s2">ever managed which is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.519" end="00:25:15.220" style="s2">things you can do to your being that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.490" end="00:25:16.750" style="s2">changed the nature of reality and if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.220" end="00:25:20.440" style="s2">do them properly you can make reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.750" end="00:25:21.399" style="s2">better it&#39;s mind-boggling and they acted</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.440" end="00:25:25.029" style="s2">that out because they didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.399" end="00:25:27.309" style="s2">understand it they noticed that if</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.029" end="00:25:29.559" style="s2">things weren&#39;t going right you had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.309" end="00:25:32.649" style="s2">sacrifice something valuable and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.559" end="00:25:34.029" style="s2">seemed to make God happy well you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.649" end="00:25:37.000" style="s2">have been a firstborn calf or a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.029" end="00:25:39.639" style="s2">firstborn son for that matter for modern</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.000" end="00:25:41.980" style="s2">people it&#39;s more like an idea you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.639" end="00:25:44.590" style="s2">to sacrifice an idea that you hold dear</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.980" end="00:25:46.149" style="s2">in order to progress because the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.590" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">that you hold dear are exactly what are</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.149" end="00:25:52.059" style="s2">making you suffer if you&#39;re suffering so</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:53.710" style="s2">you have to sacrifice them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.059" end="00:25:54.909" style="s2">have to let them go and the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.710" end="00:25:56.470" style="s2">of that is that you enter into this</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.909" end="00:25:57.610" style="s2">little period of chaos and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.470" end="00:26:01.389" style="s2">you pop out of that and that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.610" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">thing and so here&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.389" end="00:26:08.559" style="s2">observation that process of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:10.419" style="s2">state and identifying an error and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.559" end="00:26:13.659" style="s2">correcting it that&#39;s a little death and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.419" end="00:26:16.210" style="s2">rebirth that&#39;s like the Phoenix the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.659" end="00:26:20.010" style="s2">Phoenix dissolves itself into ashes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.210" end="00:26:22.420" style="s2">then pops back up as a new bird</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.010" end="00:26:26.140" style="s2">in the New Testament there&#39;s this weird</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.420" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">idea for that you have to identify with</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.140" end="00:26:33.280" style="s2">a person who continually dies and is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:37.330" style="s2">reborn or what does that mean it means</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.280" end="00:26:39.900" style="s2">that the idea that Redemption itself is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.330" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">not the consequence of being in a state</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.900" end="00:26:45.460" style="s2">it&#39;s the consequence of participating in</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:48.660" style="s2">a process and the process is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.460" end="00:26:52.870" style="s2">willingness to continually have yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.660" end="00:26:56.680" style="s2">sacrificed chaotic and then reborn and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.870" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what keeps things alive now in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.680" end="00:27:02.370" style="s2">the in the passion story there are other</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.320" end="00:27:07.000" style="s2">elements and the elements are important</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.370" end="00:27:09.730" style="s2">so for example the story of Christ is</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.000" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">predicated on the assumption that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.730" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">person who is making the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.320" end="00:27:16.780" style="s2">sacrifices performs another number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:19.110" style="s2">Acts or undergoes a number of processes</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.780" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">and one is a disciplined apprenticeship</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.110" end="00:27:25.090" style="s2">so for example in order to have some</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.190" end="00:27:36.520" style="s2">uninformed and so in the New Testament</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.550" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">reflected in popular culture for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.710" end="00:27:58.510" style="s2">in the movie Pinocchio at the end of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.150" end="00:28:33.910" style="s2">to God now that&#39;s a very strange idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very sophisticated idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.910" end="00:28:36.780" style="s2">because what happens in the Old</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.160" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">sacrifice to God well if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.320" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">God as an ineffable representation of</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.250" end="00:33:59.870" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not something that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.190" end="00:34:19.790" style="s2">after Adam and Eve&#39;s catastrophic</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.270" end="00:34:34.190" style="s2">attitudes are associated with heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.300" end="00:34:37.550" style="s2">hell well we know that human beings can</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.190" end="00:34:38.690" style="s2">turn the world into hell if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.690" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">about that and no matter how terrible</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:46.970" style="s2">you think the hell that people have</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.159" style="s2">created in the past is if you read a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.970" end="00:34:53.060" style="s2">little more history you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.159" end="00:34:54.350" style="s2">something even more terrible and people</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.060" end="00:34:56.389" style="s2">of course are afraid of the human</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.350" end="00:34:57.800" style="s2">capacity to turn things into hell that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.389" end="00:34:59.770" style="s2">one of the things that underlies our</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.420" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">do we believe that human beings can turn</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.859" end="00:35:14.180" style="s2">the world into heaven well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:15.500" style="s2">harder thing to believe because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.180" end="00:35:16.760" style="s2">a lot more ways that things could go</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.500" end="00:35:19.099" style="s2">wrong than there are ways that things</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.760" end="00:35:21.410" style="s2">can go right so heaven is a much</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.099" end="00:35:27.890" style="s2">narrower thing to aim at than hell which</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.410" end="00:35:31.250" style="s2">is a chaotic mess well maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.890" end="00:35:34.250" style="s2">improbable but life is improbable that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.250" end="00:35:37.250" style="s2">for sure and our unredeemed state of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.250" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">being is improbable and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:41.530" style="s2">that&#39;s improbably is the burden that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:45.339" style="s2">we&#39;re required to carry existentially</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.530" end="00:35:50.089" style="s2">we&#39;re it we&#39;re awake creatures of God</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.339" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">what does that mean it means that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.089" end="00:35:55.339" style="s2">suffer and it&#39;s real that suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:35:56.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that we suffer in that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.339" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">feel pain which is bad enough in</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.900" end="00:35:59.569" style="s2">frustration and disappointment and all</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:01.670" style="s2">the catastrophic things that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.569" end="00:36:03.589" style="s2">associated with life but even worse we</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.670" end="00:36:04.760" style="s2">can apprehend the possibility of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.589" end="00:36:06.290" style="s2">recurring in the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.760" end="00:36:08.200" style="s2">so even when none of those terrible</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.290" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">things happen to be happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.200" end="00:36:11.869" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty easy for us to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:14.630" style="s2">they&#39;re going to happen tomorrow and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.869" end="00:36:15.859" style="s2">they will so not only can we imagine</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.630" end="00:36:17.569" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.859" end="00:36:19.819" style="s2">tomorrow they are going to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.569" end="00:36:21.740" style="s2">tomorrow so we&#39;re in a state of constant</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.819" end="00:36:23.270" style="s2">unredeemed suffering it&#39;s a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.740" end="00:36:25.190" style="s2">and you know if you think about you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.270" end="00:36:28.780" style="s2">can&#39;t even imagine a state that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.190" end="00:36:31.190" style="s2">address that it&#39;s just too big a problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.780" end="00:36:35.420" style="s2">well so then there&#39;s another inference</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.190" end="00:36:36.829" style="s2">in the new testament and its hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.420" end="00:36:40.940" style="s2">of a meta state and the inference is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.829" end="00:36:43.400" style="s2">that a life that&#39;s predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.940" end="00:36:46.550" style="s2">constant death and renewal at every</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.400" end="00:36:49.310" style="s2">level of being a life that&#39;s predicated</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.550" end="00:36:52.760" style="s2">on a search for the truth and an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.310" end="00:36:55.430" style="s2">to act out the truth and a life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.760" end="00:36:59.300" style="s2">associated with the sacrifice of self to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.430" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">God produces a state of being that so</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.300" end="00:37:06.440" style="s2">deeply meaningful that it justifies</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:09.099" style="s2">suffering it doesn&#39;t eliminate suffering</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.440" end="00:37:14.410" style="s2">there&#39;s no elimination of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.099" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">Nietzsche said he has he who has a why</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.410" end="00:37:20.750" style="s2">can bear anyhow and what he meant by</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:24.330" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.750" end="00:37:29.250" style="s2">if what you&#39;re aiming at is of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.330" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">sufficient profundity it&#39;s worth an</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.250" end="00:37:34.580" style="s2">awful lot of misery to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.950" end="00:37:39.210" style="s2">the process of bringing it about and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.580" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">life has an unbearable depth of misery</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.210" end="00:37:50.760" style="s2">and as a consequence it needs a an</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:52.820" style="s2">absurd positive aim and the absurd</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.760" end="00:37:58.190" style="s2">positive aim</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.820" end="00:37:58.190" style="s2">that&#39;s posited in the New Testament is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.610" end="00:38:04.740" style="s2">participation in the process that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">transforms earth into heaven the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.740" end="00:38:10.100" style="s2">generation of the kingdom of God on</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:17.310" style="s2">earth and that actually means something</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.100" end="00:38:19.710" style="s2">it means that the state of being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.310" end="00:38:22.230" style="s2">described by the parameters that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.710" end="00:38:26.070" style="s2">already laid out the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.230" end="00:38:30.840" style="s2">engage in internal sacrificial death and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.070" end="00:38:33.930" style="s2">renewal and sacrifice of the self to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.840" end="00:38:37.140" style="s2">highest value produces the state of</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.140" end="00:38:42.210" style="s2">with habitation in the kingdom of God</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.450" end="00:38:46.110" style="s2">and the actions that are conducted in</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.620" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">state that&#39;s a manifestation of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.070" end="00:39:00.690" style="s2">kingdom now you all know this you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:02.340" style="s2">this the same way that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.690" end="00:39:04.860" style="s2">wrote the Bible know it because of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.340" end="00:39:08.910" style="s2">course people just like you wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.860" end="00:39:10.490" style="s2">Bible and the Bible is about people when</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.290" end="00:39:29.130" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s a mode of being and</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.910" end="00:41:26.069" style="s2">of faith I think it&#39;s very terrifying to</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.049" end="00:41:39.299" style="s2">where you think in fact the willingness</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:41.880" style="s2">to abandon going to where you think is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.299" end="00:41:45.950" style="s2">prerequisite for doing this and so in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.880" end="00:41:45.950" style="s2">sense you&#39;re you&#39;re a ship</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:52.990" style="s2">that the wind takes wherever it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.870" end="00:41:56.500" style="s2">take and the second problem I think is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.990" end="00:42:01.990" style="s2">that it&#39;s a real responsibility because</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.500" end="00:42:04.330" style="s2">in order to undertake this process you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.990" end="00:42:07.300" style="s2">have to come to terms with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.330" end="00:42:09.810" style="s2">what you do in your life your wretched</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.300" end="00:42:13.540" style="s2">miserable tragic prone life actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.810" end="00:42:15.940" style="s2">matters really it matters you know when</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.540" end="00:42:17.590" style="s2">people complain about meaninglessness in</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.940" end="00:42:21.640" style="s2">their life all the time but I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.590" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a kind of face-saving</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.640" end="00:42:25.420" style="s2">illusion I think people are more afraid</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:27.880" style="s2">of meaning than they are of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.420" end="00:42:29.740" style="s2">meaninglessness because meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.880" end="00:42:31.120" style="s2">means meaninglessness means well I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.740" end="00:42:34.510" style="s2">do whatever I want I mean it might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.120" end="00:42:36.010" style="s2">kind of you know second-rate and might</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.510" end="00:42:38.830" style="s2">be dull it might be dangerous it might</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.010" end="00:42:40.180" style="s2">be destructive but it doesn&#39;t matter and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.830" end="00:42:41.770" style="s2">so I can do whatever I want to have no</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.180" end="00:42:45.370" style="s2">responsibility because I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.770" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">anything so I&#39;m not responsible to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.370" end="00:42:49.810" style="s2">anything or anyone but if your life</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">actually has meaning and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.810" end="00:42:53.110" style="s2">always have meaning it has meaning when</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.590" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something that&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.110" end="00:42:58.210" style="s2">well then all of a sudden you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.590" end="00:43:01.570" style="s2">responsible to a higher power so to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.210" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">speak you&#39;re responsible to your own</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.570" end="00:43:05.350" style="s2">soul and you&#39;re responsible to the state</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:09.300" style="s2">of being that characterizes the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.350" end="00:43:13.800" style="s2">itself and that&#39;s a massive massive</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.300" end="00:43:15.940" style="s2">responsibility it&#39;s to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.800" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">responsibility in a sense it&#39;s to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.940" end="00:43:20.410" style="s2">responsibility for the sins of the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">which is another prerequisite of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.410" end="00:43:23.830" style="s2">mode of being that&#39;s described in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:25.540" style="s2">New Testaments a very strange idea the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.830" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">Redeemer takes on the sins of the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.540" end="00:43:34.600" style="s2">what does that mean well it means all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:38.860" style="s2">human beings are Nazis and human beings</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.600" end="00:43:41.550" style="s2">are the maoist red Garden human beings</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.860" end="00:43:45.430" style="s2">are the slaughterers in Rwanda and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.550" end="00:43:46.780" style="s2">you&#39;re all human beings and so the take</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.430" end="00:43:48.430" style="s2">on the sense of the world means to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.780" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">realize that all those things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.430" end="00:43:53.830" style="s2">characterize the human capacity to turn</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:56.380" style="s2">earth into hell characterize you and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.830" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">that in order to live properly you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.380" end="00:44:00.450" style="s2">to live in</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:04.010" style="s2">that addresses those elements of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.450" end="00:44:06.900" style="s2">nature and again that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.010" end="00:44:08.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible responsibility well</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.900" end="00:44:11.070" style="s2">first of all who wants to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.570" end="00:44:15.690" style="s2">second of all who can stand looking at</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.070" end="00:44:17.940" style="s2">it and third who&#39;s going to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.690" end="00:44:19.860" style="s2">burden of solving it well it better be</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.940" end="00:44:25.340" style="s2">all of us or we&#39;re just going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.860" end="00:44:28.830" style="s2">doing it so Redemption what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.340" end="00:44:35.430" style="s2">it means we&#39;re not in a state of grace</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.830" end="00:44:37.730" style="s2">why it was self-conscious we&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.430" end="00:44:39.750" style="s2">the owner of the tragedy of our being</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.730" end="00:44:41.550" style="s2">we&#39;re unwilling to take full</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.750" end="00:44:43.380" style="s2">responsibility for it or we&#39;re ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.550" end="00:44:49.410" style="s2">about how to do that and that leaves us</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.380" end="00:44:53.310" style="s2">bereft how do we solve that well we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.410" end="00:44:56.460" style="s2">solve it with a state but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.310" end="00:44:59.550" style="s2">the state is not reliable it degenerates</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.460" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">into tyranny then it transforms into</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.550" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:06.150" style="s2">then it reconstitutes itself and does</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:12.619" style="s2">the same thing again it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:20.760" style="s2">answer is there another answer well</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.619" end="00:45:22.410" style="s2">maybe I believe that what is outlined in</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.760" end="00:45:26.070" style="s2">narrative form in the New Testament is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.410" end="00:45:29.910" style="s2">psychologically correct I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.070" end="00:45:34.470" style="s2">the idea that endless micro death and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.910" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">renewal produces a state of proper</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.470" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">adaptation to being and that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:40.050" style="s2">prerequisites for that that are laid out</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:41.390" style="s2">in the narrative structure that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.050" end="00:45:46.109" style="s2">underlies the New Testament are</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.390" end="00:45:49.050" style="s2">fundamentally correct so to be redeemed</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.109" end="00:45:52.230" style="s2">is to aim at the highest value to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.050" end="00:45:56.030" style="s2">sacrifice what&#39;s no longer useful and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.230" end="00:46:00.090" style="s2">valid in yourself and to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.030" end="00:46:01.619" style="s2">and the consequence of that is existence</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.090" end="00:46:05.100" style="s2">in a deep state of meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.619" end="00:46:07.020" style="s2">justifies the tragedy of being and the</p>
