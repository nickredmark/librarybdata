<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:53.070" style="s2">the author of designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:55.620" style="s2">cultures which I read in preparation for</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">social change phenomena that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.140" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">springing up on Twitter and Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">if you want to know more about game B</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">which will reference from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">here I suspect check it out on game B</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">all one word on Facebook so let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">with catalysis what does that mean when</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">you describe yourself as a catalyst you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">know and this goes back to the early</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">game B days when we talked about and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:28.770" style="s2">still do constantly thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">to lower the activation energy to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.770" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">something occur is that essentially or</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">your your meaning your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">describing yourself as a catalyst yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">you could say so I mean it kind of comes</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">from this deep belief that I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">we all participate in nested dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">wholeness or scaling complex dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">systems and that these systems are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">fundamentally unpredictable and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">uncontrollable so I can&#39;t really design</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">cultures I can&#39;t really be sure how my</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.969" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">agency will lead to something or other</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:11.009" style="s2">emerging but I can catalyze positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">change by connecting the right people</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.009" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">paying attention to the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">relationships paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:20.460" style="s2">quality of information that flows</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">between agents in the system and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.460" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a paradoxical dance with</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:30.960" style="s2">emergence that we embark on when we try</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:32.490" style="s2">to catalyze anything in terms of change</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.960" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">and transformation the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.490" end="00:02:36.990" style="s2">like about the catalyst idea is that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">a chemical reaction sometimes it takes</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.990" end="00:02:40.830" style="s2">not a lot of catalyst to cause something</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">big to happen all right you can swing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.830" end="00:02:44.460" style="s2">large system with a relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">amount of catalyst because typically the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.460" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">catalyst is not used up absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s that kind of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">systemic acupuncture or homeopathy that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">that I really love doing sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">that sense of knowing what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">if you just put two people in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.520" style="s2">each other or two organizations in touch</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">with each other sometimes that can be as</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.520" end="00:03:09.900" style="s2">little as that literally just saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:11.580" style="s2">please meet so-and-so you guys need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.900" end="00:03:13.860" style="s2">talk sometimes you need to sort of hold</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.580" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">their hands a little bit longer and make</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.860" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">them understand why they should choose</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:20.550" style="s2">to invest time into working with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:23.270" style="s2">other but it&#39;s it&#39;s very little effort</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.550" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">compared to the massive amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.270" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">transformation you can can achieve by</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:29.640" style="s2">introducing just the right two people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">each other I hundred percent agree a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">good introduction is gold absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">another key kind of foundational theme</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">in your work frankly also the game we</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">world is that we are at or have exceeded</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">the carrying capacity of the earth I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:47.970" style="s2">think in your book you said that by your</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:49.800" style="s2">calculation in the 1970s humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.970" end="00:03:51.330" style="s2">started drawing more from living systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.800" end="00:03:53.610" style="s2">each year then we can effectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.330" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">regenerate what you say are the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.610" end="00:03:59.160" style="s2">imminently dangerous cliffs that were</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.430" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">approaching well I think that with sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.160" end="00:04:04.170" style="s2">of at a point now where we&#39;ve left</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">responding to the climate crisis for so</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.170" end="00:04:11.810" style="s2">long that we don&#39;t have really</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:15.090" style="s2">guarantees anymore whether we can gently</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.810" end="00:04:17.450" style="s2">stir the global planetary life-support</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.090" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">system back into a relatively stable</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">for the last ten thousand years but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.670" end="00:04:30.930" style="s2">we still have a chance so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount of urgency to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.930" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">engage in carbon drawdown in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">geo therapy rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:42.840" style="s2">geoengineering way I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:44.460" style="s2">stress and at the same time with 2019</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.840" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">being the year we&#39;re finally the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.460" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">seems to have woken up to the climate</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:52.820" style="s2">issue in a whole new way there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:55.800" style="s2">danger of getting carbon myopic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.820" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">seeing climate changes the thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.800" end="00:05:02.220" style="s2">need to go to war with and battle and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">win or win over which is all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.220" end="00:05:05.940" style="s2">metaphors that people already starting</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:07.920" style="s2">to use I actually think that climate</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.410" end="00:05:22.980" style="s2">from those symptoms is a mistaken</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.980" end="00:05:28.140" style="s2">mistaken stories that we tell about who</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.320" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">we are and why we&#39;re here ah well said</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.140" end="00:05:32.340" style="s2">and we&#39;ll come back to these stories in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">a minute another line that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.340" end="00:05:36.450" style="s2">really liked in the book was that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">described what humanity is doing as</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.450" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">drawing upon the natural capital stores</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:43.140" style="s2">of the earth I think you said that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.180" style="s2">just talk about energy that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:54.840" style="s2">in the form of fossil fuels you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.750" style="s2">say a little bit about that well in</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.840" end="00:06:00.780" style="s2">general it wasn&#39;t that great of an idea</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.540" end="00:06:47.490" style="s2">and instead of it we&#39;ve just used it as</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:03.330" style="s2">quoted is is roughly how much time it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.250" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">takes to lay down from the composting of</p>

<p begin="00:07:12.630" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">it ah good quote from Bucky Bucky fuller</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.890" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">but maybe we have been a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">better than we might think about using</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:24.630" style="s2">our you know a few hundred years worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:27.030" style="s2">of fossil fuel because we think about it</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.030" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">airline travel or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:33.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached the point where we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:35.670" style="s2">create solar cells and we&#39;ve reached the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.720" end="00:07:37.590" style="s2">point where we can do space travel so</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.590" end="00:07:41.070" style="s2">another one of the ones you mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.230" style="s2">your book was rare earth elements like</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.070" end="00:07:45.690" style="s2">indium which are indeed pretty rare on</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.230" end="00:07:49.710" style="s2">earth but not rare at all in iron</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.690" end="00:07:51.900" style="s2">asteroids so perhaps we have not by plan</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.900" end="00:07:55.980" style="s2">of our fossil fuel patrimony getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">ready for what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.980" end="00:08:01.790" style="s2">yeah I would agree with some of what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:05.820" style="s2">just said for me the the whole issue of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.790" end="00:08:09.090" style="s2">asteroid mining or going off planet is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.820" end="00:08:10.770" style="s2">something that I currently still have</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.090" end="00:08:13.830" style="s2">sort of mixed feelings about I I have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.770" end="00:08:17.250" style="s2">sense that we haven&#39;t really proven to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.830" end="00:08:20.850" style="s2">be good stewards on this planet and if</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.250" end="00:08:22.980" style="s2">we use our fledgling capabilities of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.850" end="00:08:24.780" style="s2">going off planet and we might just</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.980" end="00:08:27.920" style="s2">convert ourselves into the locus of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.780" end="00:08:30.840" style="s2">known universe rather than develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.920" end="00:08:34.349" style="s2">technologies that don&#39;t need those grain</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.840" end="00:08:36.930" style="s2">minerals and maybe even develop ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.349" end="00:08:39.570" style="s2">doing but less technology choose more</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:40.979" style="s2">wisely what technology we use when and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.570" end="00:08:42.390" style="s2">where that would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.979" end="00:08:44.160" style="s2">conversation for the two of us to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.390" end="00:08:46.650" style="s2">because I know you&#39;ve quite a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.160" end="00:08:48.780" style="s2">technological past yes and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.650" end="00:08:50.850" style="s2">quite specific view on and I think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.780" end="00:08:53.010" style="s2">defer that conversation till we get to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.850" end="00:08:54.390" style="s2">the question about why which</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.010" end="00:08:56.460" style="s2">it will be a very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.390" end="00:08:58.710" style="s2">pivotal conversation now the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.460" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">of course that we have done with our</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.710" end="00:09:04.340" style="s2">patrimony of fossil fuel as we&#39;ve grown</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:07.140" style="s2">the world&#39;s population from 1 billion to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.340" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">probably 10 or 11 billion by the time it</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.140" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">stabilizes around 2100 and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:14.940" style="s2">that is what is really crushing us you</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">know we could have a billion people</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.940" end="00:09:20.100" style="s2">living like Americans without depleting</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">the ecosystem take a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.100" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">care but not much it would be easy but</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:27.090" style="s2">with 10 or 11 billion it makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:29.130" style="s2">everything extraordinarily difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.090" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">when people start thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.130" end="00:09:34.890" style="s2">scale and what has to be done that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.580" end="00:09:36.630" style="s2">number that really has to be kept in</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.890" end="00:09:38.760" style="s2">mind is that whatever we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.630" end="00:09:41.730" style="s2">about here it has to work at the scale</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.760" end="00:09:43.830" style="s2">of 10 billion people or we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.730" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">well there&#39;s gonna be a big old die back</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.830" end="00:09:47.520" style="s2">until we get to 1 or 2 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">how important do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.520" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">population explosion over the last 250</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:57.240" style="s2">years has been I mean it&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:10:00.750" style="s2">way of denying that you can somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.240" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">superimpose the hockey stick curve of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.750" end="00:10:06.120" style="s2">climate like co2 co2 in the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:08.370" style="s2">with the population curve with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.120" end="00:10:09.930" style="s2">resource depletion curve I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.370" end="00:10:12.120" style="s2">probably seen that the great</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.930" end="00:10:13.860" style="s2">acceleration graph that the stock on</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.120" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">resilient centers put out there&#39;s even a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.860" end="00:10:17.000" style="s2">website called the great acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:19.350" style="s2">for those who want to have a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.000" end="00:10:22.470" style="s2">everything is shooting up exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:25.020" style="s2">and and it&#39;s the exponential be rising</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.470" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">fossil fuel use that has enabled the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.020" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">exponential increase in population and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:32.310" style="s2">yes it is a problem but I I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:35.540" style="s2">I sit with a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.310" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">discomfort with this increasing voice of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:40.680" style="s2">we need to talk about population for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:43.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a mean ceding of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.680" end="00:10:46.860" style="s2">notice that you&#39;ve currently elected</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.020" end="00:10:50.940" style="s2">into into office in your country to then</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.860" end="00:10:52.770" style="s2">create a sort of argument for well we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.940" end="00:10:55.650" style="s2">just need less of us then and how are we</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.770" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">going to do that and and then the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.650" end="00:11:01.470" style="s2">that make lots of money with autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:03.750" style="s2">weapons and and and warfare say oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.470" end="00:11:06.180" style="s2">here&#39;s one we prepared earlier</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.750" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s quite dangerous I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.180" end="00:11:11.160" style="s2">actually feel that we need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">deeper conversation as humanity of how</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.160" end="00:11:17.340" style="s2">we can live in shared abundance with ten</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:20.610" style="s2">billion people and how actually when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.340" end="00:11:24.330" style="s2">look at all the statistics in countries</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.610" end="00:11:27.090" style="s2">where girls are educated where education</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.330" end="00:11:31.290" style="s2">is more universally accessible for</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.090" end="00:11:33.210" style="s2">people the amount of children go down</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.290" end="00:11:35.100" style="s2">drastically because you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.210" end="00:11:38.460" style="s2">have that sort of primitive medieval</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.100" end="00:11:40.530" style="s2">insurance policy any longer to have lots</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.460" end="00:11:43.230" style="s2">of children in case because some of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.530" end="00:11:44.790" style="s2">will die because you poor and the ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.230" end="00:11:47.340" style="s2">that survive have to take care of you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.790" end="00:11:49.830" style="s2">and your old age so I yeah I&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.340" end="00:11:52.010" style="s2">little bit I don&#39;t know I might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.830" end="00:11:54.120" style="s2">but but I I have a sense that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.010" end="00:11:56.370" style="s2">actually barking a little bit up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.120" end="00:11:57.690" style="s2">wrong tree with population numbers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.370" end="00:11:59.310" style="s2">about consumption and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.690" end="00:12:04.050" style="s2">consumption of that small percentage</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.310" end="00:12:08.130" style="s2">that you and I actually probably belong</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.050" end="00:12:10.980" style="s2">to of the 10 15 percent that are at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.130" end="00:12:13.460" style="s2">top of the global pyramid that are just</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.980" end="00:12:15.930" style="s2">consuming a lot more than everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.460" end="00:12:18.390" style="s2">and then of course then in that 10</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.930" end="00:12:21.900" style="s2">percent there&#39;s another fraction that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.390" end="00:12:23.970" style="s2">it&#39;s just obscenely unequal and over</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.900" end="00:12:25.740" style="s2">consuming yeah people fly around in</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.970" end="00:12:27.660" style="s2">private jets that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.740" end="00:12:30.360" style="s2">I&#39;m with you that I think from</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.660" end="00:12:32.640" style="s2">humanitarian perspective if no other we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.360" end="00:12:34.080" style="s2">have to use as our starting gate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.640" end="00:12:36.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to build a world that can</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.080" end="00:12:39.300" style="s2">support 10 or 11 billion people by 2100</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.690" end="00:12:40.890" style="s2">and as you do point out fortunately it</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.300" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get worse than that because it</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.890" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">appears that as economic well-being</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:47.640" style="s2">increases and education increases</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:50.820" style="s2">particularly among women family sizes</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:52.260" style="s2">are starting to reach replacement level</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.820" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">or even below in a lot of the world so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.260" end="00:12:56.640" style="s2">other than sub-saharan Africa which</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:59.160" style="s2">still remains problematic so looks like</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.640" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">we can count on 10 or 11 billion which</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.160" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">is a lot better than trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:04.350" style="s2">20 billion which would be what number</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:05.820" style="s2">would be talking about if it wasn&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.350" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">the fact that birth rates are coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.820" end="00:13:09.990" style="s2">down very rapidly another foundational</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:12.930" style="s2">question before we get into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.990" end="00:13:16.100" style="s2">more details is a lot of us have heard</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.930" end="00:13:18.470" style="s2">and talked about sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.100" end="00:13:21.050" style="s2">you make a fairly careful distinction</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.470" end="00:13:23.149" style="s2">between sustainable and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.050" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">could you perhaps make that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.149" end="00:13:28.459" style="s2">for our audience here yeah I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:30.920" style="s2">bit concerned that lately over the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.459" end="00:13:32.810" style="s2">three or four years the word</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.920" end="00:13:35.930" style="s2">regenerative has become the new buzzword</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.810" end="00:13:38.089" style="s2">that is sort of consultants all over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.930" end="00:13:41.300" style="s2">world are jumping onto I must create an</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.089" end="00:13:43.160" style="s2">offer to my clients with the word</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.300" end="00:13:46.009" style="s2">regenerative in it like they have done</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:50.839" style="s2">previously with the word smart and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.009" end="00:13:53.290" style="s2">word circular in it and so I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.839" end="00:13:55.910" style="s2">really want to be very clear that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.290" end="00:13:57.709" style="s2">sustainability or being sustainable is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.910" end="00:13:59.870" style="s2">bridge that we haven&#39;t crossed yet and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.709" end="00:14:03.319" style="s2">it&#39;s still a very important milestone in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.870" end="00:14:07.310" style="s2">the journey and I also want to point out</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.319" end="00:14:09.529" style="s2">that this framing is not mine but is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.310" end="00:14:11.779" style="s2">building on the work of of people like</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.430" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">this is by Bill read called shifting our</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.160" end="00:14:22.790" style="s2">mental models if you if you put that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:26.360" style="s2">into a search engine I think it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.790" end="00:14:29.810" style="s2">2006 and there&#39;s this wonderful graphic</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.810" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">and a journey from business-as-usual to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.509" end="00:14:38.120" style="s2">green to sustainable to restorative then</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">he has this little imperious step which</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.120" end="00:14:43.339" style="s2">is called reconciliatory and then to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:45.980" style="s2">regenerative and what I like about it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.339" end="00:14:49.339" style="s2">is that it acknowledges that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.980" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">developmental process and that even the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.339" end="00:14:54.170" style="s2">step from business-as-usual to green</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:57.079" style="s2">doing a little less bad is already</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.170" end="00:14:59.870" style="s2">better than not making that step and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.079" end="00:15:02.120" style="s2">in there is this issue that in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.870" end="00:15:04.069" style="s2">particular framework sustainability is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.120" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">defined in a particular way that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.069" end="00:15:08.120" style="s2">maybe unfair to some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:11.000" style="s2">who&#39;ve been working in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.120" end="00:15:12.829" style="s2">sustainability in a really deep way they</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.000" end="00:15:15.050" style="s2">might have been thinking of it in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.829" end="00:15:16.339" style="s2">regenerative terms but in this framing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.050" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">that you&#39;re asking me to open up</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.339" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">sustainability is basically understood</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.350" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">as the point where we don&#39;t add any more</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:26.870" style="s2">damage to the system where our actions</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">don&#39;t make things worse but the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.870" end="00:15:29.420" style="s2">about needing to go beyond that to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:32.020" style="s2">restore</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:34.340" style="s2">and regenerative is that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.020" end="00:15:37.280" style="s2">degenerating the planetary life-support</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.340" end="00:15:40.220" style="s2">system and the fabric of life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.280" end="00:15:42.350" style="s2">for at least five to eight thousand</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.220" end="00:15:45.470" style="s2">years with bad agricultural practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.350" end="00:15:46.640" style="s2">and then intensely soul since the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.470" end="00:15:52.280" style="s2">beginning of the Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.640" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">and the era of fossil fuels so doing no</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.280" end="00:15:57.230" style="s2">damage being one hundred percent less</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">bad as the McDonough puts it is simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.230" end="00:16:03.250" style="s2">not enough anymore and we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:06.890" style="s2">go beyond that and restore ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.250" end="00:16:10.040" style="s2">function and create pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.890" end="00:16:12.230" style="s2">processes and the world views and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.040" end="00:16:16.130" style="s2">the organizing ideas that would allow us</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.230" end="00:16:18.590" style="s2">to actually be regenerative in place and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.130" end="00:16:21.260" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s both an internal and an</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.590" end="00:16:24.170" style="s2">external shift yeah and I really</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.260" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">resonate with that I it&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.170" end="00:16:27.620" style="s2">work that I personally have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">for life my wife and my wife I must give</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.620" end="00:16:33.770" style="s2">her more credit than myself on our farm</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:36.100" style="s2">we bought a farm deep in Appalachia very</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.770" end="00:16:39.230" style="s2">rural America that had been horribly</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.100" end="00:16:41.930" style="s2">depleted the soils were completely shot</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.230" end="00:16:44.120" style="s2">by over grazing they burned off the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.930" end="00:16:46.370" style="s2">understory in the woods to let sheep</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.120" end="00:16:48.950" style="s2">graze in them they had bad timbering</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.370" end="00:16:51.530" style="s2">practices they would either clear-cut or</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.950" end="00:16:54.080" style="s2">just let woods run rampant until they</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.530" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">were rotting and falling apart and over</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.080" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">the last 30 years we have focused on two</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:02.570" style="s2">things one returning our pastures to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:05.060" style="s2">health and I think we&#39;ve added an inch</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.570" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">and a half two inches five centimeters</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.060" end="00:17:11.480" style="s2">of soil by very carefully managing our</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:15.080" style="s2">pastures and our hay fields and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.480" end="00:17:16.850" style="s2">by managing our timber very carefully no</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.080" end="00:17:18.980" style="s2">longer doing clearcuts are then to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.850" end="00:17:21.620" style="s2">rid of monoculture or pine that we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.980" end="00:17:23.810" style="s2">and instead doing selective cuts where</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.620" end="00:17:26.990" style="s2">we upgrade the quality of the timber</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.810" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">over time and absolutely don&#39;t use fire</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.990" end="00:17:32.540" style="s2">as a method of you know killing off the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:35.180" style="s2">understory and so our farm is now a</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.540" end="00:17:36.890" style="s2">thing of relatively good beauty very</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.180" end="00:17:38.660" style="s2">high productivity here&#39;s the amazing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.890" end="00:17:40.490" style="s2">thing our hay fields produce</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.660" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">three-and-a-half times as much hay per</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.490" end="00:17:44.970" style="s2">acre as they did before well</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:47.810" style="s2">not using any artificial fertilizer so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.970" end="00:17:51.540" style="s2">you know I have a very strong sense that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.810" end="00:17:54.270" style="s2">regenerative care of our earth is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.540" end="00:17:57.870" style="s2">way to go absolutely I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.270" end="00:18:00.030" style="s2">the way that we have managed to get to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.870" end="00:18:03.210" style="s2">this point I think most of our species</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.030" end="00:18:05.190" style="s2">history has been placed based and by</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.210" end="00:18:08.670" style="s2">original for those who will know Matic</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.190" end="00:18:12.470" style="s2">within bioregional territory and we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.670" end="00:18:15.660" style="s2">known how to carefully garden the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.470" end="00:18:18.630" style="s2">ecosystems that we&#39;ve been living in but</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">also like these indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.630" end="00:18:22.380" style="s2">understand themselves as belonging to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:25.680" style="s2">the land rather than the land belonging</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.380" end="00:18:27.510" style="s2">to them and they&#39;ve been like for</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.680" end="00:18:30.510" style="s2">example there&#39;s now clear studies that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.510" end="00:18:34.050" style="s2">most of Colombian Amazonia is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.510" end="00:18:35.970" style="s2">human created forest garden where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.050" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">black soil the Terra Preta in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.970" end="00:18:42.270" style="s2">region has clearly has bits of clay and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">bits of vegetable carbon in it that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.270" end="00:18:47.790" style="s2">only come from people digging basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:49.890" style="s2">activated biochar into the forest floor</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.790" end="00:18:51.570" style="s2">and selecting which which trees a bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.890" end="00:18:54.420" style="s2">like you&#39;re doing on your land selecting</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.570" end="00:18:58.140" style="s2">which trees a part of that ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.420" end="00:19:01.170" style="s2">the same as is in the prairies of the US</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.140" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">there are clear indications that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.170" end="00:19:06.840" style="s2">some Native American tribes have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">managing the bison herds in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.840" end="00:19:12.930" style="s2">actually increased the abundance of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">those ecosystems so we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.930" end="00:19:17.610" style="s2">healing and positive influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:20.220" style="s2">ecosystems that we&#39;re keystone species</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.610" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">in we don&#39;t have to destroy them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.220" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">where our farm is in fact my wife has</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:25.680" style="s2">been pretty involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">archaeological community there and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.680" end="00:19:28.770" style="s2">know the general sense of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.230" end="00:19:35.460" style="s2">open pastures in an area that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.150" end="00:19:36.150" style="s2">normally be climax forest for hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.460" end="00:19:38.520" style="s2">of miles</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.150" end="00:19:40.740" style="s2">particularly along the river valleys for</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.520" end="00:19:42.840" style="s2">bison because we actually had bison in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.740" end="00:19:44.970" style="s2">the eastern United States until</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.840" end="00:19:47.340" style="s2">historical times when the white man with</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.970" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">his guns wiped him out on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.340" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">I always like to warn people that it may</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">not have been that the prehistoric</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">people were better hearted got to keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">in mind they also had a heck of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.809" style="s2">less capability you know I think what</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.250" end="00:20:02.300" style="s2">would the Aztecs have done if they had</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.809" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">bulldozers and nuclear weapons I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:07.970" style="s2">they would have done the same bad stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:10.850" style="s2">or worse than we&#39;ve done so I always try</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.970" end="00:20:13.429" style="s2">to encourage people to not be you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.850" end="00:20:15.980" style="s2">in generally wishful thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.429" end="00:20:17.270" style="s2">past and so-called indigenous people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.980" end="00:20:18.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just like nature you know say</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.270" end="00:20:20.750" style="s2">alright you know nature keeps a balance</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.860" end="00:20:22.610" style="s2">well yes and no one of the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.750" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">data signals that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.610" end="00:20:30.740" style="s2">evolutionary ecology was the famous Lynx</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:33.170" style="s2">snowshoe hare oscillation where the Lynx</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.740" end="00:20:35.390" style="s2">eats the hares until there aren&#39;t any or</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.170" end="00:20:38.120" style="s2">hardly any a very smaller population</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.390" end="00:20:40.309" style="s2">then the Lynx died out almost not quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.120" end="00:20:43.610" style="s2">and then the snowshoe hares rebound and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.309" end="00:20:46.460" style="s2">then the Lynx rebounds so you know mr.</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.610" end="00:20:49.250" style="s2">Lynx and mr. hare kind of go at it in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.460" end="00:20:51.710" style="s2">fairly extreme battle and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.250" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">frankly just the fact that the Lynx</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.710" end="00:20:55.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t quite capable of wiping out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">snowshoe hares it allows the system to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.550" end="00:21:03.530" style="s2">persevere well two things that the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:06.490" style="s2">bit I completely agree with that we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.530" end="00:21:09.170" style="s2">to be absolutely careful of not</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.490" end="00:21:11.480" style="s2">idealizing indigenous cultures or</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.170" end="00:21:13.700" style="s2">painting some sort of picture of going</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.480" end="00:21:16.070" style="s2">back to some golden past that wasn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.700" end="00:21:21.140" style="s2">golden as some people are now talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.070" end="00:21:22.790" style="s2">about it and there is value in the story</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.140" end="00:21:24.950" style="s2">of interbeing that these cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.790" end="00:21:27.290" style="s2">told from it from many years that has</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.950" end="00:21:31.130" style="s2">enabled them to live differently within</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.290" end="00:21:33.260" style="s2">their landscapes and with regard to the</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.260" end="00:21:35.809" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.470" end="00:21:39.050" style="s2">I mean evolutionary biology biology</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.809" end="00:21:41.420" style="s2">originally by training in these I mean</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.970" end="00:21:49.130" style="s2">on just snow like like two species</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.510" end="00:21:50.570" style="s2">and then you do the classic predator</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.130" end="00:21:51.650" style="s2">prey model and you get these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.570" end="00:21:53.420" style="s2">results but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.650" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">Heisenberg told us over 100 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.420" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">that what we see is not nature but</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">nature exposed to our method of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:02.900" style="s2">questioning that&#39;s a extreme abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:04.700" style="s2">of the complexity of the ecosystems that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.900" end="00:22:07.250" style="s2">those predator and prey species apart</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:09.220" style="s2">and the dynamics that really go on are</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.250" end="00:22:13.320" style="s2">much more complex and they Optim</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.220" end="00:22:17.020" style="s2">is the overall system for health and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.320" end="00:22:19.809" style="s2">increase in bio productivity it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.020" end="00:22:21.880" style="s2">we get species stand we tunnel down into</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.809" end="00:22:25.690" style="s2">individual species or individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.880" end="00:22:28.929" style="s2">we get these seemingly corroborating</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.690" end="00:22:32.020" style="s2">data of how competitive and red in tooth</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.929" end="00:22:33.640" style="s2">and claw nature really is and yes those</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.020" end="00:22:35.860" style="s2">things exist in nature but they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.640" end="00:22:40.630" style="s2">fine-tuning on the surface of an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.860" end="00:22:43.299" style="s2">of symbiosis and cooperation nature is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.630" end="00:22:46.330" style="s2">far more cooperative and symbiotic then</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.299" end="00:22:49.380" style="s2">then we understand because we have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.330" end="00:22:52.570" style="s2">tendency to just look at things by</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.380" end="00:22:55.690" style="s2">abstracting tiny little sections of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.570" end="00:22:57.490" style="s2">complexity out of the living hole the</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.490" end="00:23:01.210" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a definitely some truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.950" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">to that and that&#39;s of course why that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.210" end="00:23:04.620" style="s2">the links and the hair examples so</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.070" end="00:23:07.350" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.620" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">where there isn&#39;t other side branches</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.350" end="00:23:12.250" style="s2">while in reality in mode because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">very extremely environment the far north</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.250" end="00:23:17.799" style="s2">etc and most of our ecosystems have much</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">more across dependencies and dynamism</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.799" end="00:23:22.539" style="s2">and in fact our Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:25.030" style="s2">researcher Jennifer Dunne is not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.539" end="00:23:27.340" style="s2">of really good work on the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.030" end="00:23:29.110" style="s2">food networks in ecosystems including</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.340" end="00:23:32.049" style="s2">arctic ones and one of the things she</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.110" end="00:23:33.880" style="s2">finds which surprises some people well</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.049" end="00:23:36.520" style="s2">she&#39;s not the only one and I will say</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.880" end="00:23:39.610" style="s2">she&#39;s not decisive on this is that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.520" end="00:23:42.929" style="s2">seems to be something like a moderate</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.610" end="00:23:46.299" style="s2">level of diversity that is that is best</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.929" end="00:23:49.780" style="s2">you know that very high diversity food</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.299" end="00:23:51.820" style="s2">webs become less stable and at very low</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.780" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">diversity they become even more unstable</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.820" end="00:23:57.370" style="s2">so there&#39;s some kind of homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:24:00.549" style="s2">level of diversity that any given</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.370" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">ecosystem seems to evolutionary seek out</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.549" end="00:24:07.179" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah yeah she&#39;s done some very</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">very interesting work on that which</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.179" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">actually is a good bridge to the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:12.970" style="s2">topic which is you know your work is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.390" style="s2">full of systems thinking and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.970" end="00:24:16.990" style="s2">complexity perspective which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.390" end="00:24:19.179" style="s2">unfortunately particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.990" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">complexity perspective not as common as</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.179" end="00:24:22.150" style="s2">I would like in people thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:24.970" style="s2">these issues</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.150" end="00:24:26.860" style="s2">you come to those tools and and how</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.970" end="00:24:32.440" style="s2">important are they in your ideas around</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">regenerative design um really the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.440" end="00:24:37.510" style="s2">people who I or a huge debt of gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:40.120" style="s2">to for having been important mentors of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.510" end="00:24:44.830" style="s2">mine in that yeah people like Brian</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.120" end="00:24:48.610" style="s2">Goodwin my guy in 2001 after a short</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.830" end="00:24:52.800" style="s2">stint of trying to kind of fools rush in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.610" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">where angels fear to tread em I spent</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.800" end="00:24:57.310" style="s2">1999-2000 in southern Spain trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:00.360" style="s2">set up an environmental education center</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.310" end="00:25:02.770" style="s2">and kind of model eco village community</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.360" end="00:25:06.850" style="s2">yes I did have long hair and I did have</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.770" end="00:25:08.710" style="s2">a VW van and all the paraphernalia that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.850" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">go along with it and then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.710" end="00:25:14.200" style="s2">that I still needed to learn a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.970" style="s2">and so in 2001 signed up for the Masters</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:19.350" style="s2">in holistic science at Omaha college in</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.970" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">Devon and Brian Goodwin who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.350" end="00:25:26.410" style="s2">mathematical biologists and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">biologist who also was very close with</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.410" end="00:25:32.110" style="s2">Stewart Kaufman and involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:33.820" style="s2">setting up of the Santa Fe Institute he</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.110" end="00:25:35.770" style="s2">was one of the people that had set up</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.820" end="00:25:38.770" style="s2">that master&#39;s and so a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.770" end="00:25:41.590" style="s2">insights into complexity theory come</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.770" end="00:25:43.390" style="s2">from him and then at that very same</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.590" end="00:25:44.950" style="s2">place from AHA College it&#39;s it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.390" end="00:25:47.530" style="s2">those places where you just get fed on</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.950" end="00:25:50.010" style="s2">an incredibly rich diet of inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.530" end="00:25:53.350" style="s2">people like John Todd and David Orr and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.010" end="00:25:55.750" style="s2">Fritjof Capra and so I&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.350" end="00:25:58.360" style="s2">blessing the the privilege of learning</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.750" end="00:26:01.210" style="s2">from some of the leading systems people</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.360" end="00:26:04.150" style="s2">in the world and and so it&#39;s critical to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.210" end="00:26:05.410" style="s2">how I think about things and that insert</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.150" end="00:26:07.690" style="s2">that I mentioned in the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.410" end="00:26:09.970" style="s2">of our conversation that that we really</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.690" end="00:26:10.810" style="s2">like Brian go to and put it in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.970" end="00:26:12.490" style="s2">nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.810" end="00:26:13.900" style="s2">in terms of insights from complexity</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.490" end="00:26:16.270" style="s2">theory it&#39;s it&#39;s a slightly of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.900" end="00:26:17.860" style="s2">simplifying statement but he said any</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:20.020" style="s2">system that is more than three</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.860" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">interacting variables is a complex</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:49.000" style="s2">when you look at the mathematics behind</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.230" end="00:29:41.390" style="s2">years right so we we can have some level</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.929" end="00:29:52.490" style="s2">parts may well be the most complex thing</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:09.650" style="s2">you know we know our body temperature is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.250" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">not likely to vary between more like 85</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.650" end="00:30:15.830" style="s2">Fahrenheit and 110 Fahrenheit if it does</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:17.179" style="s2">you will die right and we know that if</p>

<p begin="00:30:29.750" end="00:30:33.590" style="s2">you may have whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.159" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">unanticipated consequences and you may</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.590" end="00:30:38.150" style="s2">get it entirely wrong on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful either</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.150" end="00:30:42.740" style="s2">practically or philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.539" style="s2">emotionally to throw up our hands and</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.740" end="00:30:46.400" style="s2">say we have no ability to predict or</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.539" end="00:30:48.380" style="s2">control either yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.400" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">well said you&#39;re absolutely right and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.380" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">know exactly the feeling of observing</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:56.870" style="s2">oneself being normally saying one thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:59.559" style="s2">and then finding finding yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.870" end="00:31:00.810" style="s2">other community and saying the like</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.559" end="00:31:03.270" style="s2">trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.810" end="00:31:06.090" style="s2">but when you bridge built between camps</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.270" end="00:31:08.400" style="s2">or polar opposites then sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.090" end="00:31:11.400" style="s2">it&#39;s normal to be in that role of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.400" end="00:31:13.230" style="s2">depending on who you talk to and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.400" end="00:31:15.930" style="s2">offer the voice that&#39;s underrepresented</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.230" end="00:31:18.180" style="s2">and yeah you&#39;re right there is some</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.930" end="00:31:20.430" style="s2">predictability and some controllability</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.180" end="00:31:23.430" style="s2">but what the reason why I tend to stress</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.430" end="00:31:27.270" style="s2">this quite a lot is that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.430" end="00:31:30.150" style="s2">think we really need more humility in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.270" end="00:31:33.420" style="s2">order to get out of this current</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.150" end="00:31:35.820" style="s2">conundrum and if we come at it with too</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.420" end="00:31:37.590" style="s2">much gung-ho science and technology were</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.820" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">right over the hill and save us I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.590" end="00:31:43.010" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna ask the deeper questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:46.290" style="s2">that we need to ask in order to apply</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.010" end="00:31:48.930" style="s2">science and technology in a wise way so</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.290" end="00:31:52.350" style="s2">they will contribute to saving us but</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.930" end="00:31:53.970" style="s2">not by themselves yeah I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.350" end="00:31:56.850" style="s2">that&#39;s just getting that tuning right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.970" end="00:31:58.950" style="s2">other words I use is epistemic modesty</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.850" end="00:32:01.440" style="s2">right nice when we&#39;re playing with</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.950" end="00:32:03.990" style="s2">complex systems we do have some</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:06.570" style="s2">knowledge so we&#39;re not epistemic idiots</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.990" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">but we are not naive 14-year old</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.570" end="00:32:11.190" style="s2">Newtonian right I remember when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:13.800" style="s2">14 year old nerdy guy right I thought</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.190" end="00:32:16.140" style="s2">Laplace was right tell me the position</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.800" end="00:32:17.640" style="s2">and motions of all the particles in the</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.640" end="00:32:23.610" style="s2">forever right we know that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.370" end="00:32:25.590" style="s2">multiple levels right if only because it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.610" end="00:32:27.570" style="s2">deterministic chaos but probably for</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.590" end="00:32:29.850" style="s2">lots of deeper reasons around</p>

<p begin="00:32:41.340" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">tune that correctly and it varies by</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.110" end="00:32:48.210" style="s2">situation and frankly by how hard you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">probing a system you know a human body</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:33:01.350" style="s2">space suddenly it&#39;s much more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.230" end="00:33:03.480" style="s2">to very far trajectories away from its</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.350" end="00:33:04.560" style="s2">homeostasis so we have to worry about</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.610" end="00:33:22.170" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d love to elect that term at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.230" end="00:33:25.380" style="s2">stomach modesty also I think pairs well</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.170" end="00:33:29.280" style="s2">with if you have a systemic modesty then</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.380" end="00:33:32.610" style="s2">you can more you&#39;re more likely to also</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.280" end="00:33:35.390" style="s2">entertain epistemic plurality in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.610" end="00:33:38.580" style="s2">sense of multiple ways of knowing being</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.390" end="00:33:41.100" style="s2">pathways to meaningful insights which</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.580" end="00:33:42.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.100" end="00:33:45.690" style="s2">need to rent them against each other but</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.750" end="00:33:48.690" style="s2">I find it it&#39;s it&#39;s a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.690" end="00:33:50.970" style="s2">thing that I wrestle with a lot of how</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.690" end="00:33:54.600" style="s2">do you on the one hand sound a voice</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.970" end="00:33:58.980" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t get trapped too much</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.600" end="00:34:01.890" style="s2">in a entirely analytic rational mainly</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.980" end="00:34:06.270" style="s2">quantities focused and mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.890" end="00:34:09.179" style="s2">analyzed scientific mindset and no</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.270" end="00:34:11.640" style="s2">matter how fundamentally useful and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.179" end="00:34:13.740" style="s2">necessary that mindset and and epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.640" end="00:34:16.260" style="s2">approach is but we also need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.740" end="00:34:19.470" style="s2">acknowledge other ways of knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.260" end="00:34:21.720" style="s2">go back to what what Jung describes as</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.470" end="00:34:23.429" style="s2">our four ways of knowing and thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.720" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2">just one of them sensing feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.429" end="00:34:28.620" style="s2">intuiting are the other three and in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:31.020" style="s2">species history many of the cultures we</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.620" end="00:34:34.020" style="s2">mistakenly have called primitive and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.020" end="00:34:36.390" style="s2">have had really interesting ways of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.020" end="00:34:39.540" style="s2">generating meaningful insights from</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.390" end="00:34:42.659" style="s2">active participation in that whole that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.540" end="00:34:44.310" style="s2">we are we will address that question in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.659" end="00:34:46.919" style="s2">some detail when we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.310" end="00:34:49.530" style="s2">discussion of consciousness which is one</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:51.000" style="s2">of my home areas of expertise I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.530" end="00:34:53.190" style="s2">some good questions I think for you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.000" end="00:34:54.840" style="s2">there so let&#39;s defer going down that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.190" end="00:34:56.909" style="s2">for a little while the next thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.840" end="00:34:58.650" style="s2">like to chat about is I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.909" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">your book designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.650" end="00:35:04.020" style="s2">cultures is very much worth reading in</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:06.660" style="s2">general but especially useful for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.020" end="00:35:08.430" style="s2">many lists of questions that you put in</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.660" end="00:35:10.740" style="s2">this book in fact I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.430" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">yesterday I was I was finishing up</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.740" end="00:35:15.900" style="s2">reading it that you know it would kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:17.970" style="s2">of be fun to publish a spinoff of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.900" end="00:35:20.040" style="s2">book calling it the list of many</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.970" end="00:35:22.110" style="s2">important questions or something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.040" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">that which was mostly just the questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.110" end="00:35:24.990" style="s2">with a little bit of introduction before</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:26.580" style="s2">and after I mean he&#39;s questioned these</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.990" end="00:35:28.500" style="s2">list of questions are amazing what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.580" end="00:35:30.810" style="s2">caused you to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.500" end="00:35:37.530" style="s2">Qin&#39;s rather Lemoore in this book at</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.810" end="00:35:39.720" style="s2">least than answers epistemic humility so</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.530" end="00:35:42.750" style="s2">so basically I had this moment of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.720" end="00:35:44.550" style="s2">sitting there in the seaside cafe where</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.750" end="00:35:46.410" style="s2">I wrote the good part of the book and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.550" end="00:35:48.690" style="s2">looking out at the horizon and just</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.410" end="00:35:51.990" style="s2">suddenly having this sort of really</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.690" end="00:35:55.080" style="s2">strong rush of what could have turned</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.990" end="00:35:57.030" style="s2">into a severe writer&#39;s block saying like</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.080" end="00:35:59.970" style="s2">what is it that I can write in these</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.030" end="00:36:02.130" style="s2">pages that would make this book a work</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.970" end="00:36:04.520" style="s2">that works this is a kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.130" end="00:36:08.370" style="s2">alchemical notion that it actually would</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.520" end="00:36:10.020" style="s2">change the person who&#39;s reading it that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.370" end="00:36:11.640" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be the same afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.020" end="00:36:14.820" style="s2">anymore that&#39;s a notion that I got from</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.640" end="00:36:17.090" style="s2">Henry port oft and also what can I write</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.820" end="00:36:21.900" style="s2">in this book that has some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.090" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">longevity beyond just five ten fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.900" end="00:36:26.070" style="s2">twenty years and something that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:28.950" style="s2">could continuously be meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.070" end="00:36:31.320" style="s2">readers in the future and I began to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.950" end="00:36:33.840" style="s2">realize that if you look at the history</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.320" end="00:36:36.620" style="s2">of humanity a lot of the problems we</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.840" end="00:36:39.390" style="s2">faced along the way were the results of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.620" end="00:36:42.360" style="s2">solutions that other people thought were</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.390" end="00:36:44.610" style="s2">a good idea previous to that and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.360" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">means that there&#39;s a sort of general</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.610" end="00:36:51.320" style="s2">pattern that today&#39;s solutions turn into</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:54.270" style="s2">tomorrow&#39;s problems and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.320" end="00:36:56.760" style="s2">epistemic hubris or arrogance to think</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.270" end="00:36:57.930" style="s2">that even no matter how studied you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.760" end="00:36:59.580" style="s2">in terms of how to building a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.930" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">sustainable regenerative future for</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.580" end="00:37:04.230" style="s2">Humanity that you could sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:06.900" style="s2">give a long catalogue of answers and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.230" end="00:37:09.300" style="s2">solutions that will last forever and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.900" end="00:37:12.570" style="s2">that will not have unforeseen side</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.300" end="00:37:14.580" style="s2">effects so at that point I was reminded</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.570" end="00:37:16.680" style="s2">of this wonderful Einstein quote where</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.580" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">he says if I had a problem that my life</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.680" end="00:37:20.850" style="s2">depended upon and I only had one hour to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:22.710" style="s2">solve it I would take fifty five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.850" end="00:37:24.540" style="s2">to get the question right because then I</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.710" end="00:37:27.000" style="s2">could solve it in five minutes so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.540" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">think that there is something mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.000" end="00:37:31.830" style="s2">in thinking that questions are</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:33.960" style="s2">transitory means to get to better</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.830" end="00:37:36.870" style="s2">solutions I think maybe solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.960" end="00:37:40.260" style="s2">answers are transitory means to ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.870" end="00:37:42.030" style="s2">better questions and so I play with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.260" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">throughout the entire book</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.030" end="00:37:47.460" style="s2">because I don&#39;t pretend to have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:51.750" style="s2">answers I mean the books full of some</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.460" end="00:37:55.110" style="s2">people trying to offer potential answers</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.750" end="00:37:57.300" style="s2">and and I I loved referencing people</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.110" end="00:38:00.090" style="s2">because I I love giving people the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.300" end="00:38:01.380" style="s2">opportunity to to follow upstream to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.090" end="00:38:03.960" style="s2">whether where I&#39;ve got the information</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.380" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">from so it&#39;s not that I&#39;m against</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.960" end="00:38:08.370" style="s2">answers and solutions there there lots</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:10.050" style="s2">of ideas in the book that that could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.370" end="00:38:12.570" style="s2">called answers and solutions but I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.050" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">that the more powerful compass that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.570" end="00:38:17.880" style="s2">can hand from one generation to the next</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:20.460" style="s2">to steer our way into an uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.880" end="00:38:23.460" style="s2">future with where we acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.460" end="00:38:24.870" style="s2">limit to what is knowable is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.460" end="00:38:28.170" style="s2">set of questions rather than a set of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.870" end="00:38:30.690" style="s2">answers that&#39;s very good as I said I</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.170" end="00:38:32.490" style="s2">point to the book especially for its</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.690" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">questions it&#39;s really in a remarkable a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.490" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">useful set of questions and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">work with working scientists all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:40.950" style="s2">time one of things I&#39;ve found is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:43.860" style="s2">the very best scientists are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.950" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">who form their their scientific program</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.860" end="00:38:48.900" style="s2">around the best questions getting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:50.730" style="s2">answers is sometimes a matter of super</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.900" end="00:38:52.680" style="s2">technique etc but frankly a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.730" end="00:38:54.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just brute force but asking the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.680" end="00:38:56.430" style="s2">right questions in science is key let me</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.690" end="00:38:57.810" style="s2">just briefly go back to one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.430" end="00:38:59.130" style="s2">that he said because you use it I said</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.810" end="00:39:01.560" style="s2">it would be interesting to write a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.130" end="00:39:03.750" style="s2">sequel to the book we&#39;re just taking the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.560" end="00:39:06.990" style="s2">questions I just want to share with you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.750" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">that when I first wrote it I am like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.990" end="00:39:10.980" style="s2">after why the book was with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:14.030" style="s2">publisher I embarked on this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.980" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">creating a set of playing cards that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.030" end="00:39:17.820" style="s2">would engage people around the questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:19.950" style="s2">in the book and have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.820" end="00:39:21.330" style="s2">additional sort of set of cards that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.950" end="00:39:24.090" style="s2">people could order along with the book</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.330" end="00:39:25.650" style="s2">to engage with these questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.090" end="00:39:27.930" style="s2">around the same time a colleague of mine</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.650" end="00:39:30.150" style="s2">from guy education asked me to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.930" end="00:39:32.460" style="s2">like a workshop one-day workshop in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.150" end="00:39:34.350" style="s2">set of materials that we could offer</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.460" end="00:39:35.850" style="s2">through guy education to engage people</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.350" end="00:39:38.940" style="s2">with the sustainable development goals</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.850" end="00:39:41.580" style="s2">and in the end I decided to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:44.010" style="s2">merge those two projects and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.580" end="00:39:46.710" style="s2">developed through Gaia education a set</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.010" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">of flashcards that engage local</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.710" end="00:39:52.590" style="s2">communities in the conversation around</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.590" end="00:39:57.589" style="s2">us in this place how are they meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.279" end="00:39:59.779" style="s2">and these cards are all based on</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.589" end="00:40:02.359" style="s2">questions and many of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.779" end="00:40:05.150" style="s2">are in my book as somehow reframed and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.359" end="00:40:07.669" style="s2">worked into this set of flashcards in</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.150" end="00:40:09.859" style="s2">the over 200 my book there 250 questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.669" end="00:40:12.109" style="s2">and in the flash cards on the SDGs there</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.859" end="00:40:14.779" style="s2">are over 200 questions so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.109" end="00:40:18.229" style="s2">thing does exist and it exists using</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.779" end="00:40:21.169" style="s2">again that bridge that I say see like</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.229" end="00:40:22.609" style="s2">not dissing sustainability not dissing</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.169" end="00:40:24.979" style="s2">the sustainable development goals</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.609" end="00:40:29.509" style="s2">apart from goal number eight which I</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.979" end="00:40:32.089" style="s2">have a big issue with but to use the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.509" end="00:40:33.829" style="s2">platform that has now been agreed on by</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.089" end="00:40:38.779" style="s2">the international community with these</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.829" end="00:40:40.849" style="s2">17 goals as an entry point to take them</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.779" end="00:40:42.979" style="s2">people into the deeper conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.849" end="00:40:45.400" style="s2">about what would buy a regional</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.979" end="00:40:49.640" style="s2">regeneration look like in your place</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.400" end="00:40:52.069" style="s2">using the SDGs as a stepping stone we</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.640" end="00:40:54.380" style="s2">will get the link from Daniel will put</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.069" end="00:40:56.269" style="s2">it up on the episode page and as we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.380" end="00:40:58.089" style="s2">in the pre-roll just go to our episode</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.269" end="00:41:01.369" style="s2">page and we&#39;ll get a link to those cards</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.089" end="00:41:03.559" style="s2">assuming such a link exists yes I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.369" end="00:41:05.419" style="s2">let you off without telling me what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.559" end="00:41:09.229" style="s2">goal 8 and why do you disapprove of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.419" end="00:41:14.390" style="s2">goal 8 is good work and economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.229" end="00:41:17.779" style="s2">and and framed in that particular way I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.390" end="00:41:20.659" style="s2">would call it the spanner and the works</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.779" end="00:41:22.429" style="s2">of the SDGs is the Trojan horse that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.659" end="00:41:26.150" style="s2">will make the implementation of all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.429" end="00:41:28.189" style="s2">other STDs impossible until we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.150" end="00:41:31.009" style="s2">conversation of what kind of growth we</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.189" end="00:41:33.409" style="s2">want and how we may measure growth and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.009" end="00:41:37.640" style="s2">that GDP isn&#39;t desperately inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.409" end="00:41:40.459" style="s2">measure of success or progress and so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.640" end="00:41:42.859" style="s2">really need to reframe goal number eight</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.459" end="00:41:44.900" style="s2">at the very least to something like good</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.859" end="00:41:47.419" style="s2">work and qualitative growth because that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.900" end="00:41:48.979" style="s2">would then at least invite people to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.419" end="00:41:51.169" style="s2">what do they mean by qualitative growth</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.979" end="00:41:53.019" style="s2">but if we just call it economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.169" end="00:41:56.929" style="s2">then it basically means let&#39;s continue</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.019" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">with the structure of dysfunctionality</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.929" end="00:42:01.159" style="s2">that underlies the system that has set</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:04.159" style="s2">up the system we&#39;re playing in as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.159" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">winner and loser game that is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.159" end="00:42:08.179" style="s2">necessitates losers in order to create</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:09.380" style="s2">winners there&#39;s a fundamental design</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.179" end="00:42:11.180" style="s2">flaw in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:13.910" style="s2">our economic system structure drives</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.180" end="00:42:16.069" style="s2">behavior in complex systems and unless</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.910" end="00:42:17.809" style="s2">we change the structure we can try to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.069" end="00:42:20.809" style="s2">world saving as long as we want but we</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.809" end="00:42:23.420" style="s2">won&#39;t turn this Titanic around before it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.809" end="00:42:24.589" style="s2">hits the iceberg yeah absolutely we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.420" end="00:42:27.019" style="s2">talk about that a little later when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.589" end="00:42:29.299" style="s2">talk about signaling systems but I like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.019" end="00:42:31.519" style="s2">this framing of growth I also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.299" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">push back whenever I hear people say no</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.519" end="00:42:36.289" style="s2">growth I say well it depends write</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">growth into the microcosm is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.289" end="00:42:41.089" style="s2">necessarily disruptive of our ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:43.849" style="s2">our home here on earth right now I like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.089" end="00:42:46.670" style="s2">your framing at is quality it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.849" end="00:42:48.410" style="s2">always good to get at the reference I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.670" end="00:42:50.539" style="s2">send you the link there is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.410" end="00:42:52.009" style="s2">paper that I highly recommend people</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.539" end="00:42:53.630" style="s2">should read and it&#39;s mentioned in my</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.009" end="00:42:55.549" style="s2">book there&#39;s a chapter on it in my book</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.630" end="00:42:57.829" style="s2">it&#39;s by Fritjof Capra and Hazel</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.549" end="00:43:00.200" style="s2">Henderson and it is called shifting from</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.829" end="00:43:01.729" style="s2">quantitative to qualitative growth comes</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.200" end="00:43:04.369" style="s2">highly recommended because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.729" end="00:43:08.989" style="s2">is the frame I completely agree with we</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.369" end="00:43:11.450" style="s2">this D growth and anti growth is is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.989" end="00:43:12.349" style="s2">the way to dance with this as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.450" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">biologist</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.349" end="00:43:17.509" style="s2">we certainly want a hell of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:19.160" style="s2">growth in terms of growing top soils</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.509" end="00:43:21.710" style="s2">growing forests growing healthy</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:24.410" style="s2">ecosystem functions and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.710" end="00:43:26.359" style="s2">a lot of qualitative growth that we we</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.410" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">want to engage in yeah just a simple</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.359" end="00:43:29.779" style="s2">thing wouldn&#39;t it be nice to take the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:31.640" style="s2">same ingredients that you get at a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.779" end="00:43:34.190" style="s2">fast-food restaurant and turn them into</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.640" end="00:43:36.440" style="s2">a beautiful and healthful meal right you</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.190" end="00:43:38.450" style="s2">know this requires a completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.440" end="00:43:40.430" style="s2">different way of thinking about how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.450" end="00:43:42.049" style="s2">process the food and frankly how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.430" end="00:43:43.460" style="s2">grow it and a bunch of other things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.049" end="00:43:45.619" style="s2">you could have great beauty and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.460" end="00:43:47.829" style="s2">wonderful experience rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.619" end="00:43:50.089" style="s2">being a feeding trough for Humanity</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.829" end="00:43:53.450" style="s2">absolutely but probably the same or</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.089" end="00:43:56.630" style="s2">lower load on the ecosystem now back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.450" end="00:44:00.049" style="s2">questions you correctly in my view call</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.630" end="00:44:02.359" style="s2">out the prime question as why and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.049" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">even mention my friend simon Sinek</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.359" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">Simon advised the earliest days of game</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:10.099" style="s2">be when we were talking about why but</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:11.420" style="s2">one of the things that I couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.099" end="00:44:13.219" style="s2">in your book I even went back this</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.420" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">morning and tried to have you know leaf</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.219" end="00:44:18.950" style="s2">through it rapidly and find it is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:20.559" style="s2">is your why why should humanity strive</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.950" end="00:44:23.259" style="s2">to exist</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.559" end="00:44:24.910" style="s2">so yeah this I asked this question based</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.259" end="00:44:27.219" style="s2">on a conversation that I had with</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.910" end="00:44:29.439" style="s2">another one of my mentors David all just</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.219" end="00:44:32.979" style="s2">after I finished my PhD I visited him in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.439" end="00:44:35.499" style="s2">Oberlin in Ohio at the college that she</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.979" end="00:44:38.410" style="s2">taught at and I asked him a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.499" end="00:44:41.410" style="s2">which is actually about the dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.410" end="00:44:43.029" style="s2">spirituality and the sacred in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.410" end="00:44:45.039" style="s2">transition that we now needed to may</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.029" end="00:44:47.559" style="s2">make in order to redesign the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.039" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">presence on earth within the lifetime of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.559" end="00:44:54.160" style="s2">the generations of life today and he</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">started his answer by saying that before</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.160" end="00:44:58.839" style="s2">we can meaningfully answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:03.400" style="s2">what we have to do and how we might do</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.839" end="00:45:04.749" style="s2">it in order to sustain our species we</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.400" end="00:45:06.670" style="s2">need to ask a much more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.749" end="00:45:10.390" style="s2">question and that&#39;s the question of why</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.670" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">are we worth sustaining and I kind of on</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.390" end="00:45:15.630" style="s2">purpose leave my answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:18.729" style="s2">somewhat vague throughout the book I</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.630" end="00:45:20.859" style="s2">eluded many times of why I believe were</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.729" end="00:45:24.489" style="s2">worth sustaining and if you ask me</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.859" end="00:45:28.410" style="s2">straight out I would say not in any</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.489" end="00:45:32.009" style="s2">extremely special way like all life</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.410" end="00:45:35.309" style="s2">forms on planet Earth reflect that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.009" end="00:45:37.689" style="s2">transforming dynamic wholeness that were</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.309" end="00:45:41.349" style="s2">participants in and emerging properties</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.689" end="00:45:43.449" style="s2">off back to itself and they reflect the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.349" end="00:45:45.429" style="s2">experience of participation in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.449" end="00:45:49.269" style="s2">wholeness from a particular perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.429" end="00:45:51.160" style="s2">and but I do feel that the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.269" end="00:45:53.709" style="s2">reflective consciousness that we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.160" end="00:45:56.170" style="s2">with the capability of learning from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.709" end="00:45:58.509" style="s2">past and and to some extent possibly</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.170" end="00:46:01.390" style="s2">even applying that learning to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.509" end="00:46:03.160" style="s2">our path into the future there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.390" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">something beautiful about the way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.160" end="00:46:11.469" style="s2">we&#39;ve written poetry and created art to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">express our love for other beings human</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.469" end="00:46:16.929" style="s2">and not non-human there is there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:20.679" style="s2">many examples of human beings constantly</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.929" end="00:46:23.140" style="s2">stepping out of the the sort of mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.679" end="00:46:25.059" style="s2">neo-darwinian story of only doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.140" end="00:46:27.160" style="s2">that is in self-interest but actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.059" end="00:46:30.789" style="s2">risking their own lives to save other</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.160" end="00:46:31.900" style="s2">lives because we are biophilic by nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.789" end="00:46:34.990" style="s2">we we we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.900" end="00:46:37.990" style="s2">have a tendency to to love life and feel</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:44.500" style="s2">consciousness this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.829" end="00:46:48.059" style="s2">interesting but for me part of why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.500" end="00:46:50.559" style="s2">worth sustaining is that humanity is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.059" end="00:46:53.589" style="s2">way that the universe is beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.559" end="00:46:58.119" style="s2">know itself through us as and we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.589" end="00:47:01.740" style="s2">part of that universe and that in itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.119" end="00:47:04.450" style="s2">to to not kill that story in its</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.740" end="00:47:06.849" style="s2">immature juvenile stage where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.450" end="00:47:13.260" style="s2">still apt as a species and to actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.849" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">make that jump in our awareness of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.260" end="00:47:18.430" style="s2">participatory mystique and magic that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:20.410" style="s2">we&#39;re part of to really become conscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.430" end="00:47:23.079" style="s2">participants in that process and try to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.410" end="00:47:25.559" style="s2">be of healing and regenerative influence</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.079" end="00:47:29.289" style="s2">on it and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.559" end="00:47:32.829" style="s2">sticking around for a few more millennia</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.289" end="00:47:35.349" style="s2">or even millions of years to see where</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.829" end="00:47:39.279" style="s2">that would take us if if we managed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.349" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">mature enough to not come to a immature</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.279" end="00:47:46.900" style="s2">early end well that&#39;s an interesting why</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:50.650" style="s2">and I can respect it but I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.900" end="00:47:53.309" style="s2">at the gut level it doesn&#39;t feel like it</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.650" end="00:47:55.569" style="s2">might may be a sufficiently strong</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.650" end="00:48:06.970" style="s2">metaphysics peddled so I got my own I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.930" end="00:48:09.809" style="s2">love to hear your reaction to it my why</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.970" end="00:48:12.430" style="s2">why humanity may be of the utmost</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.809" end="00:48:15.299" style="s2">importance is when we look out into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.430" end="00:48:19.029" style="s2">universe as far as we know this</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.299" end="00:48:21.130" style="s2">unbelievably huge universe of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.029" end="00:48:24.970" style="s2">billion galaxies each with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.130" end="00:48:29.170" style="s2">billion stars is entirely dead there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.970" end="00:48:33.160" style="s2">no sign so far of any life anywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.170" end="00:48:36.670" style="s2">this amazing universe of ours so I put</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.160" end="00:48:39.670" style="s2">forth the why that humanity&#39;s mission is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.670" end="00:48:42.190" style="s2">to bring the universe to life and it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.670" end="00:48:44.380" style="s2">within our ability to do so now first we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.190" end="00:48:45.550" style="s2">have to stabilize our earth and so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.380" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">have a hundred-year mission</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.550" end="00:48:50.140" style="s2">to stabilize our earth home but then I</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:53.500" style="s2">would suggest that we do that for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.140" end="00:48:56.560" style="s2">purpose of then reaching back out again</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.500" end="00:48:59.080" style="s2">to bring the universe to life assuming</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.560" end="00:48:59.830" style="s2">that we are the only advanced life in</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.080" end="00:49:02.020" style="s2">the universe</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:09.310" style="s2">paradox and the Fermi paradox asks if</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.240" end="00:49:11.470" style="s2">there are all these intelligent beings</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.690" end="00:49:46.900" style="s2">shoulders if we think about it this way</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.580" end="00:49:50.050" style="s2">that our mission is to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.900" end="00:49:52.840" style="s2">universe to life is immense if we screw</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.050" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">it up it may be 5 billion years before</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.840" end="00:49:56.110" style="s2">somebody has a shot at it again may</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:58.570" style="s2">never happen again it may have been that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.110" end="00:50:00.580" style="s2">the peculiarities of our particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.570" end="00:50:02.050" style="s2">trajectory of life got us to this point</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.580" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">and nobody else has ever been there or</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.050" end="00:50:06.280" style="s2">may ever be there again and if we blow</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:09.340" style="s2">it we have blown something way bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.280" end="00:50:11.890" style="s2">than just enjoying our consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.340" end="00:50:13.870" style="s2">whatever on the other hand the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.890" end="00:50:15.940" style="s2">answer to the Fermi paradox is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.870" end="00:50:18.700" style="s2">there are other advanced civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.940" end="00:50:20.200" style="s2">out there and we don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.700" end="00:50:22.570" style="s2">that question yet though even though we</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.200" end="00:50:27.070" style="s2">see nothing so far to indicate that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.570" end="00:50:29.980" style="s2">the case then we pivot on our goal pivot</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.070" end="00:50:32.860" style="s2">on our Y and say that our role is to fit</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.980" end="00:50:35.140" style="s2">into intergalactic civilization to learn</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.860" end="00:50:37.510" style="s2">and to add that intergalactic</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.140" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">civilization in the way that&#39;s uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.510" end="00:50:45.240" style="s2">human yeah and again you put it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:49.480" style="s2">beautifully in response to mine I I</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.240" end="00:50:52.030" style="s2">respect that Y as well my response would</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.480" end="00:50:54.100" style="s2">be two things come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.030" end="00:50:57.070" style="s2">there&#39;s wonderful little coven and hops</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.070" end="00:51:02.410" style="s2">front of a bunch of open tins and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.430" end="00:51:04.360" style="s2">litter in front of a bunch of tree</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.410" end="00:51:06.270" style="s2">trunks where obviously somebody is</p>

<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:13.540" style="s2">convincing evidence for the existence of</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.940" end="00:51:23.230" style="s2">oh that that is just how they do things</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.010" end="00:51:24.790" style="s2">right we&#39;re still in in cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.230" end="00:51:27.010" style="s2">quarantine because we&#39;re not mature</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.010" end="00:51:31.180" style="s2">way of framing it but also Kurt</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.990" end="00:51:33.370" style="s2">Vonnegut&#39;s lugia of years sort of we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.370" end="00:51:36.430" style="s2">developed that level of self reflective</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.930" end="00:51:39.240" style="s2">consciousness and now we take it out to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.430" end="00:51:42.940" style="s2">the will reminded me of Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.240" end="00:51:45.100" style="s2">statement next time no brain we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.940" end="00:51:46.120" style="s2">quite know yet whether our intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.100" end="00:51:49.990" style="s2">is a maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.120" end="00:51:54.550" style="s2">or an adaptive trait the judges judges</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.990" end="00:51:57.700" style="s2">are still out and and if I look at those</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.550" end="00:52:00.460" style="s2">figures that you just named of billions</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.700" end="00:52:02.890" style="s2">of galaxies and billions of stars and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.460" end="00:52:05.830" style="s2">who knows how many planets revolving</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.890" end="00:52:08.260" style="s2">around those star systems the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.830" end="00:52:11.110" style="s2">that we&#39;re completely alone to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.260" end="00:52:13.090" style="s2">is is quite low I know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.110" end="00:52:15.610" style="s2">sort of sweet spot where our planet is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.090" end="00:52:19.060" style="s2">in our solar system for certain life</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.610" end="00:52:21.070" style="s2">forms to evolve but III mean I again I</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.060" end="00:52:23.500" style="s2">sit with more questions than answers but</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.070" end="00:52:25.720" style="s2">one question that I definitely sit with</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.500" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">is this idea that there&#39;s dead matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.720" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">out there and then at some point out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:33.970" style="s2">this dead matter even on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:36.190" style="s2">boom life emerged Oh wonderful and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.970" end="00:52:38.710" style="s2">that life complexified and evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.190" end="00:52:40.870" style="s2">then Oh consciousness emerged I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.710" end="00:52:42.520" style="s2">that we might be in a tram track of an</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.870" end="00:52:44.920" style="s2">explanatory model that we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.520" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">repeated for too long that is this sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.920" end="00:52:49.270" style="s2">of coming out of dead meta it actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:52.540" style="s2">seems to me more parsimonious to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.270" end="00:52:54.550" style="s2">everything is somewhat conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.540" end="00:52:59.470" style="s2">everything is somewhat alive at</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.550" end="00:53:02.860" style="s2">different levels of complexity then to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.470" end="00:53:05.480" style="s2">say suddenly ex nihilo life appears</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.770" end="00:54:26.300" style="s2">very much worth thinking about before we</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:21.730" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s bill sharps model</p>

<p begin="00:55:24.940" end="00:55:29.470" style="s2">of worked with him in applying it in</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.859" end="00:55:32.350" style="s2">different ways and basically bill was a</p>

<p begin="00:55:47.080" end="00:55:50.560" style="s2">different voices that are always in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.850" end="00:55:53.290" style="s2">room when we look at the future and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.560" end="00:55:56.440" style="s2">there&#39;s always that perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.290" end="00:55:59.650" style="s2">kind of manager type who&#39;s responsible</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.440" end="00:56:02.230" style="s2">for keeping system a in place and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.650" end="00:56:04.119" style="s2">functioning and that&#39;s a valuable role</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.230" end="00:56:06.190" style="s2">to some extent because it&#39;s the person</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.119" end="00:56:07.660" style="s2">who cares about people being in jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.190" end="00:56:09.130" style="s2">kept children being in school and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.660" end="00:56:10.630" style="s2">lights staying on and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.130" end="00:56:14.530" style="s2">stuff and water coming out of the faucet</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.630" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the the visionary type</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.530" end="00:56:19.150" style="s2">which is the third horizon perspective</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:21.100" style="s2">that is saying no no no we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.150" end="00:56:23.020" style="s2">fundamentally redesign our economic</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.100" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">system and we need a shift in</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:29.950" style="s2">and then very often you find that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.820" end="00:56:32.230" style="s2">arguments get polarized between these</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.950" end="00:56:34.270" style="s2">the visionary and the kind of pragmatic</p>

<p begin="00:56:36.550" end="00:56:41.410" style="s2">is the entrepreneur innovators</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.440" end="00:56:45.250" style="s2">perspective that that builds on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.410" end="00:56:48.100" style="s2">already feasible today disruptive of</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.250" end="00:56:51.100" style="s2">horizon one and could potentially become</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.100" end="00:56:53.859" style="s2">a bridge to getting to horizon three</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.100" end="00:56:56.800" style="s2">without the sort of collapse and rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.859" end="00:56:59.320" style="s2">scenario this framework really helps us</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.800" end="00:57:01.980" style="s2">to bring these three perspectives into</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.320" end="00:57:05.740" style="s2">the room and talk intelligently about</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.980" end="00:57:09.670" style="s2">how we think the future of transport or</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.740" end="00:57:13.750" style="s2">the future of computing might pan out in</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.670" end="00:57:16.330" style="s2">ways that at the very least make us</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.750" end="00:57:19.030" style="s2">disagree more intelligently at the end</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.330" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">of it and maybe even make us see because</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.030" end="00:57:23.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a kind of open mindset</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:26.740" style="s2">in a closed mindset in each of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.890" end="00:57:28.660" style="s2">three perspectives on the future and by</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.740" end="00:57:32.170" style="s2">working with this three horizon model</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.660" end="00:57:33.819" style="s2">you can really fresh out insights from</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.819" end="00:57:38.829" style="s2">with an open mindset really listening to</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.829" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">three perspectives made and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:45.700" style="s2">building future consciousness together</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:49.450" style="s2">so as we stir our way into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.700" end="00:57:51.460" style="s2">we can respond quicker yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.450" end="00:57:53.980" style="s2">wonderful as I said I was very taken</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.460" end="00:57:55.869" style="s2">with this and so I will try to inject it</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.980" end="00:57:58.150" style="s2">into our game be world now reference</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.869" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">both bill Sharpe and you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.150" end="00:58:03.069" style="s2">interesting I had a personal residence</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:06.130" style="s2">with it which is in the business world</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.069" end="00:58:08.410" style="s2">where I spent 25 years I was clearly a</p>

<p begin="00:58:15.069" end="00:58:20.200" style="s2">it worked it worked great especially as</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:25.809" style="s2">our world was transitioning between say</p>

<p begin="00:58:25.809" end="00:58:32.500" style="s2">find myself since 2012 being kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:58:32.500" end="00:58:37.329" style="s2">I find myself very much of horizon to</p>

<p begin="00:58:37.329" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">there on the extreme of blow it all up</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.490" end="00:58:45.490" style="s2">build it all from scratch but rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:48.130" style="s2">find my game a skills which were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.490" end="00:58:50.290" style="s2">good to probably be most useful in the</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.450" end="00:59:00.309" style="s2">so what can we do to make the plane fly</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.910" end="00:59:03.069" style="s2">better until somebody else figures out</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.309" end="00:59:05.140" style="s2">how to build a rocket ship mm-hmm yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.069" end="00:59:07.809" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s interesting because in</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.140" end="00:59:09.430" style="s2">that horizon to space of that model</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.809" end="00:59:12.369" style="s2">there&#39;s another really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.430" end="00:59:15.400" style="s2">question that this framework opens up</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.369" end="00:59:17.740" style="s2">which is the horizon to space is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.400" end="00:59:20.619" style="s2">kind of what are the practical things we</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.740" end="00:59:23.500" style="s2">can do today to possibly build a</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.619" end="00:59:25.299" style="s2">different future and you can always ask</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.500" end="00:59:27.490" style="s2">a question about a horizon to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.299" end="00:59:30.309" style="s2">proposition which is is it horizon 2</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.490" end="00:59:33.099" style="s2">plus or horizon - - and that jargon</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.309" end="00:59:35.490" style="s2">refers to is it likely to be captured by</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.099" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">the first horizon and therefore actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.490" end="00:59:42.220" style="s2">perpetuates game a for longer or is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:45.730" style="s2">already a stepping-stone innovation that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.220" end="00:59:49.780" style="s2">actually helps us to buy time</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.730" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">to get to game b or the third horizon so</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.780" end="00:59:55.450" style="s2">this this distinguishing but to make it</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.650" end="00:59:57.820" style="s2">give a concrete example for example if</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.450" end="01:00:01.480" style="s2">in the shift towards renewable energies</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.730" end="01:00:32.290" style="s2">shifting into a stepping stone towards</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.040" end="01:00:34.660" style="s2">horizon 3 so it&#39;s it&#39;s one in the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.290" end="01:00:38.320" style="s2">technology depending on what mindset and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.660" end="01:00:41.020" style="s2">what frame its apply it can be horizon 2</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.320" end="01:00:42.490" style="s2">plus or horizon 2 minus I like that a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.020" end="01:00:45.070" style="s2">lot and I do remember it from the book</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.490" end="01:00:46.600" style="s2">and I should have mentioned it in my own</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.070" end="01:00:49.420" style="s2">model of how the world works we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.600" end="01:00:52.510" style="s2">basins of attraction and game a is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.420" end="01:00:54.130" style="s2">game we&#39;ve been in since 1694 at 2</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.510" end="01:00:58.450" style="s2">o&#39;clock in the afternoon on March 15</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.130" end="01:01:00.580" style="s2">right and we are trying it feels like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.450" end="01:01:02.890" style="s2">get out of that basin for good or ill</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.580" end="01:01:06.520" style="s2">and we could end up in some bad basins</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.890" end="01:01:08.110" style="s2">and so I think of 2 pluses as things</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.520" end="01:01:10.360" style="s2">that are climbing the wall</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.110" end="01:01:12.790" style="s2">to get us closer to escape from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.360" end="01:01:14.170" style="s2">current basin that may be a useful way</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.790" end="01:01:15.970" style="s2">to think about that and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.170" end="01:01:19.210" style="s2">really important for those of us who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.970" end="01:01:21.370" style="s2">doing horizon to work to make sure we</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.210" end="01:01:23.740" style="s2">think about your concept of horizon 2</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.370" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">plus I&#39;m gonna inject that also into</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.740" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">game because I think you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:29.560" style="s2">right that that&#39;s hugely important gosh</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:31.420" style="s2">I got so many topics here let&#39;s go on to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.560" end="01:01:33.190" style="s2">another one which is very central to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.420" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">your work and frankly I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.190" end="01:01:37.840" style="s2">understand it as well as I could and</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">that is the distinction between an</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.840" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">abundance and a scarcity way of doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:48.280" style="s2">things you you call our way of our world</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:50.380" style="s2">a scarcity mindset or a scarcity formula</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.280" end="01:01:52.810" style="s2">and that where we need to go to is an</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.380" end="01:01:53.670" style="s2">abundance worldview could you expand on</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.810" end="01:01:57.190" style="s2">those two things</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.670" end="01:01:59.060" style="s2">hang it comes again from where do we put</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.190" end="01:02:03.410" style="s2">the focus of attention</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.060" end="01:02:05.510" style="s2">with regard to what is life like I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.410" end="01:02:08.210" style="s2">we need to hold that bizarre paradox</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.510" end="01:02:10.820" style="s2">that while of course if somebody pinches</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.210" end="01:02:13.730" style="s2">me it hurts me if somebody pinches you I</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.820" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">don&#39;t immediately feel it I can see you</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.730" end="01:02:19.340" style="s2">wince and somehow feel some form of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:23.750" style="s2">empathy with with that but ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.340" end="01:02:25.880" style="s2">life is a planetary process and it that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.750" end="01:02:28.610" style="s2">planetary process like as Janine Benyus</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.880" end="01:02:30.380" style="s2">is beautifully put it from biomimicry</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.610" end="01:02:32.930" style="s2">life creates conditions conducive to</p>

<p begin="01:02:32.930" end="01:02:38.540" style="s2">process is abundance generating it</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.110" end="01:02:41.900" style="s2">actually has over time increased the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.540" end="01:02:46.760" style="s2">amount of diversity and biomass on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.900" end="01:02:49.460" style="s2">planet and has made it possible to for</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.760" end="01:02:51.590" style="s2">more diverse life-forms to evolve but in</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.460" end="01:02:53.800" style="s2">that if you if we like one way of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.590" end="01:02:55.970" style="s2">framing what evolution does is</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.800" end="01:02:58.730" style="s2">diversification and subsequent</p>

<p begin="01:03:00.680" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">and if you go through the history of the</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:13.160" style="s2">reintegration of generated diversity</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.070" end="01:03:16.700" style="s2">tends to be first and foremost through</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.160" end="01:03:20.510" style="s2">novel forms of cooperation and whether</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.700" end="01:03:23.000" style="s2">it&#39;s two non nucleated cells forming</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.510" end="01:03:26.990" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of in the symbiosis theory</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.000" end="01:03:29.690" style="s2">like forming a more complex cell but the</p>

<p begin="01:03:31.310" end="01:03:33.620" style="s2">creating a whole that is more than the</p>

<p begin="01:03:33.620" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">same with the step to multicellular</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.440" end="01:03:41.320" style="s2">organisms to the step to more complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:43.880" style="s2">life-forms that didn&#39;t even have social</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.320" end="01:03:46.790" style="s2">organizations and each of these steps</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.880" end="01:03:51.020" style="s2">the most important innovation of life</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.790" end="01:03:54.020" style="s2">has been a novel form of cooperation in</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.020" end="01:03:56.900" style="s2">sharing the abundance and so it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.020" end="01:03:59.840" style="s2">focus that is too much on that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.900" end="01:04:02.690" style="s2">individualist species nationalist</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.840" end="01:04:05.720" style="s2">America first and all that stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.690" end="01:04:08.010" style="s2">just short-sighted and we&#39;re all on</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.720" end="01:04:10.890" style="s2">living spaceship earth</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.010" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">if the planetary life-support system</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.890" end="01:04:15.480" style="s2">gives we&#39;ve all had it no matter whether</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:18.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the kind of money that some of</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.750" end="01:04:25.940" style="s2">and you know must have but fat chance</p>

<p begin="01:04:31.890" end="01:04:36.690" style="s2">functional biosphere so what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.130" end="01:04:39.359" style="s2">about with the shift from scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:41.790" style="s2">mindset to abundance mindset is very</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.359" end="01:04:43.740" style="s2">much linked to the shift from the story</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.790" end="01:04:46.560" style="s2">of separation to the story of interbeing</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.740" end="01:04:49.080" style="s2">it is a understanding that the most</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.560" end="01:04:51.390" style="s2">enlightened way I can work for my</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.080" end="01:04:55.500" style="s2">self-interest is to actually optimize</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.390" end="01:04:57.240" style="s2">the whole system for everyone and since</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.500" end="01:05:03.930" style="s2">I&#39;m part of that that will come back to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.240" end="01:05:07.410" style="s2">me at the same time I mean yes we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.930" end="01:05:10.650" style="s2">abundance at the ecosystem level and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.410" end="01:05:12.030" style="s2">is a very interesting fact that once we</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.650" end="01:05:14.040" style="s2">had life it has been gradually</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.030" end="01:05:15.750" style="s2">increasing its complexity and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.040" end="01:05:18.060" style="s2">lot of argument amongst the complexity</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.750" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">folks whether that&#39;s necessary or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.060" end="01:05:22.109" style="s2">just something that happened and I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:24.320" style="s2">not qualified to have an opinion there</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.109" end="01:05:26.460" style="s2">well at least not qualified to have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.320" end="01:05:28.710" style="s2">well-founded opinion I have an opinion</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.460" end="01:05:30.510" style="s2">which is yes there is a force that seems</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.710" end="01:05:32.760" style="s2">to be pushing us towards more complexity</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.510" end="01:05:36.780" style="s2">what that is I don&#39;t know on the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.760" end="01:05:39.720" style="s2">hand in terms of actually evolving or</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.780" end="01:05:42.270" style="s2">growing a social operating system the</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.720" end="01:05:44.550" style="s2">actual quality of life of the typical</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.270" end="01:05:47.190" style="s2">human also has to be taken into</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.550" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">consideration you know if a human has to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.190" end="01:05:50.910" style="s2">go back to what has been the history of</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:53.160" style="s2">humans since the invention of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.910" end="01:05:55.470" style="s2">agriculture which is back-breaking work</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.160" end="01:05:58.109" style="s2">living on the edge of starvation and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.470" end="01:06:00.600" style="s2">have 50% of your kids die before they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.109" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">5 years old that&#39;s not gonna seem like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.600" end="01:06:05.160" style="s2">good trade from where we&#39;re at even in</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:06.630" style="s2">the less developed countries today so it</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.160" end="01:06:08.820" style="s2">seems to me that if we&#39;re really gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.630" end="01:06:10.530" style="s2">be selling an idea of abundance we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.820" end="01:06:13.470" style="s2">to be thinking carefully it was some</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.530" end="01:06:15.930" style="s2">precision about what actual quality of</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.470" end="01:06:17.609" style="s2">life can we deliver to 10 billion humans</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.930" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">and I do think we have to think about</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.609" end="01:06:21.140" style="s2">all 10 billion of them at some point</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:23.190" style="s2">they&#39;re all going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.140" end="01:06:26.039" style="s2">approximately the same quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.190" end="01:06:28.680" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a really hard part of</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.039" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">this problem how do we build to a level</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.680" end="01:06:33.720" style="s2">frankly probably build down from the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:36.119" style="s2">Western table consumption but build up</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.720" end="01:06:37.740" style="s2">from the very poor country levels of</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.740" end="01:06:42.450" style="s2">that all 10 billion would agree is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.960" end="01:06:43.859" style="s2">decent quality of life for Humanity and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.450" end="01:06:45.539" style="s2">that may not be easy</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.859" end="01:06:47.819" style="s2">abundance at the level of actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.539" end="01:06:50.099" style="s2">delivering the goods is hard work I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.819" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">as I said I was a business guy for 25</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.099" end="01:06:53.700" style="s2">years held frankly for 40 years when go</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:55.279" style="s2">back to when I was a kid I had little</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.449" end="01:08:28.710" style="s2">idea that agriculture that I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.609" end="01:08:31.830" style="s2">where I think that the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.710" end="01:08:33.929" style="s2">both/and between some patterns from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.830" end="01:08:34.390" style="s2">past and some technological innovation</p>

<p begin="01:08:37.690" end="01:08:42.940" style="s2">wisely we could create a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.660" end="01:08:45.790" style="s2">abundance with a lot less work than was</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.940" end="01:08:48.130" style="s2">necessary in those earlier agricultural</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.790" end="01:08:49.810" style="s2">societies and I just recently learned</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.130" end="01:08:52.750" style="s2">from from a friend something that was</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.810" end="01:08:56.080" style="s2">very interesting that if you if you look</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.750" end="01:08:59.290" style="s2">at the history of the Roman Empire the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.080" end="01:09:02.440" style="s2">first place that the Romans went out to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.290" end="01:09:05.770" style="s2">invade was the Iberian Peninsula Spain</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.440" end="01:09:08.980" style="s2">where I live and it was also the last of</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.770" end="01:09:12.760" style="s2">the places that they actually colonized</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.980" end="01:09:14.890" style="s2">into the Roman Empire so for a very very</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.760" end="01:09:17.530" style="s2">long time the tribes on the Iberian</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.890" end="01:09:21.580" style="s2">Peninsula resisted the Roman invasion</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.530" end="01:09:24.190" style="s2">and one of the reasons that they so</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.580" end="01:09:27.340" style="s2">strongly resisted is that the that Rome</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.190" end="01:09:30.580" style="s2">was bringing a wheat based or grain</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.340" end="01:09:32.680" style="s2">based agricultural system into a culture</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.580" end="01:09:34.330" style="s2">that was actually a tree culture it was</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.680" end="01:09:36.250" style="s2">an acorn culture they made their bread</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.330" end="01:09:39.480" style="s2">and their basic foodstuffs from</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.250" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">collecting acorns and managing large</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.480" end="01:09:44.860" style="s2">open acorn forests and the animals</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:47.530" style="s2">living within them and so they actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.860" end="01:09:50.410" style="s2">just like many Native American tribes in</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.530" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">North America didn&#39;t have this what you</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.410" end="01:09:56.350" style="s2">were just painting this back-breaking</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:10:00.160" style="s2">hard slobbery off of work they they</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.350" end="01:10:01.990" style="s2">managed to meet basic needs in three or</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.160" end="01:10:05.260" style="s2">four months of work and that the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.990" end="01:10:07.900" style="s2">the time they engaged in whatever their</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.260" end="01:10:09.850" style="s2">fancy as in some cases was going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.900" end="01:10:11.440" style="s2">territorial warfare with each other in</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.850" end="01:10:15.190" style="s2">other cases it was it was creating</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:19.000" style="s2">culture and and general merrymaking so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.190" end="01:10:21.700" style="s2">I think we we can create a wise blend of</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.000" end="01:10:24.460" style="s2">appropriate technology in place with</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.700" end="01:10:26.260" style="s2">sensitivity to the local ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.460" end="01:10:30.070" style="s2">the local culture in such a way that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.260" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">can actually create well-being and</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.070" end="01:10:36.360" style="s2">meaningful existence within shared</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:38.440" style="s2">abundance for all of humanity but not</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.360" end="01:10:40.360" style="s2">necessarily in the way we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.440" end="01:10:42.730" style="s2">right now we&#39;re being happy means also</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.360" end="01:10:44.200" style="s2">having vastly expensive status status</p>

<p begin="01:10:46.590" end="01:10:51.870" style="s2">yeah we call the hedonistic treadmill</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.620" end="01:10:53.280" style="s2">right that&#39;s one of the root problem get</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.870" end="01:10:54.600" style="s2">that on that quickly what I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.280" end="01:10:55.830" style="s2">actually just interject something that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.600" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">happened to know from my reading in</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.830" end="01:11:00.740" style="s2">history is that Ben Franklin one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:02.940" style="s2">most astute founding fathers of America</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.740" end="01:11:06.420" style="s2">commented on the fact that to his</p>

<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:13.770" style="s2">as he know not a single Indian had ever</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.670" end="01:11:17.040" style="s2">voluntarily come to live with the white</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.770" end="01:11:19.020" style="s2">man yeah that&#39;s an interesting yen and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.040" end="01:11:21.150" style="s2">got shouldn&#39;t II know a lot of examples</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.020" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">of first and I don&#39;t know any examples</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.150" end="01:11:27.150" style="s2">of the form of unless they&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:11:41.220" end="01:11:45.690" style="s2">find in your book I looked I even did a</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.220" end="01:16:51.390" style="s2">to hear your view is that money what is</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.350" end="01:16:54.000" style="s2">money money is a social signalling</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.390" end="01:16:57.000" style="s2">system for coordinating production</p>

<p begin="01:17:21.060" end="01:17:26.159" style="s2">captured our system and is making all of</p>

<p begin="01:17:29.459" end="01:17:33.749" style="s2">of money on money return and what can</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.499" end="01:17:35.610" style="s2">the single dimension of money do as you</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.749" end="01:17:37.769" style="s2">pointed out others have pointed out it</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.610" end="01:17:39.659" style="s2">doesn&#39;t speak at all to externalities</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.769" end="01:17:41.669" style="s2">like depletion of these things we talked</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.659" end="01:17:43.320" style="s2">about the very beginning the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.669" end="01:17:45.329" style="s2">functions I by the way like your term</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.320" end="01:17:48.809" style="s2">ecosystem functions rather than eco</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.329" end="01:17:50.669" style="s2">system services and so when I come</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.809" end="01:17:52.889" style="s2">around to it is we need some forms of</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.669" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">social signaling because making thing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.889" end="01:17:58.679" style="s2">is hard the temptation not to save is</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:18:03.239" style="s2">great and we need to appropriately count</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.679" end="01:18:04.469" style="s2">and score our non-renewable resources so</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.239" end="01:18:06.539" style="s2">we need something that does that but</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.469" end="01:18:07.979" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not as simple-minded in</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.539" end="01:18:12.989" style="s2">single dimensional is what we currently</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.979" end="01:18:14.760" style="s2">call money yeah I learned a lot from the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.989" end="01:18:17.820" style="s2">work of Bell maleate ah who died a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.760" end="01:18:20.809" style="s2">couple of years ago sadly and he spent a</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.820" end="01:18:23.699" style="s2">large part of his life working on</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.809" end="01:18:26.969" style="s2">complementary currency systems and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.699" end="01:18:28.769" style="s2">was a very big proponent of that one of</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.969" end="01:18:31.169" style="s2">the problems is that we we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.769" end="01:18:34.260" style="s2">enough different types of money that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.169" end="01:18:36.479" style="s2">need much more diversity in these</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.260" end="01:18:38.550" style="s2">systems that can help us to either</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.479" end="01:18:41.280" style="s2">circulate things more at the local and</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.550" end="01:18:43.409" style="s2">by regional economy scale but then also</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.280" end="01:18:46.829" style="s2">enable where needed international</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.409" end="01:18:49.679" style="s2">exchange so I would agree that that were</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.829" end="01:18:52.769" style="s2">most likely gonna have to have some form</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.679" end="01:18:54.719" style="s2">of record-keeping in the form of money</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.769" end="01:18:56.189" style="s2">or something similar like that but I</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:57.959" style="s2">know that there&#39;s a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.189" end="01:18:59.489" style="s2">once people go down that rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.959" end="01:19:01.979" style="s2">they get extremely passionate about</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.489" end="01:19:03.840" style="s2">their points of view and and I quite</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.979" end="01:19:06.510" style="s2">often like with the social media work I</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.840" end="01:19:08.369" style="s2">do I get one of these people kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.510" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">latching on to me and just don&#39;t you see</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.369" end="01:19:13.079" style="s2">you have to look at it this way and this</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:15.389" style="s2">is the only solution and I yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.079" end="01:19:17.999" style="s2">haven&#39;t had time to really drill into</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.389" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">all the proposals that exists therefore</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.999" end="01:19:21.630" style="s2">money less world but I&#39;m certainly</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:23.070" style="s2">finding it a little bit dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.630" end="01:19:25.050" style="s2">this whole proliferation of</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.070" end="01:19:26.909" style="s2">cryptocurrencies and the vast data</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.050" end="01:19:29.999" style="s2">footprint and energy footprint they then</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.909" end="01:19:32.610" style="s2">create and while they&#39;re good ones and</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.999" end="01:19:34.860" style="s2">not so good ones and I only have 1/2</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.610" end="01:19:37.409" style="s2">knowledge of which ones that use less</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.860" end="01:19:39.050" style="s2">energy and which ones use more I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.409" end="01:19:41.809" style="s2">we&#39;re still experimenting with</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.050" end="01:19:43.909" style="s2">what alternatives we have to the current</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.809" end="01:19:46.489" style="s2">money system and yes I completely agree</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.909" end="01:19:49.340" style="s2">that this this idea that paying interest</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.489" end="01:19:52.480" style="s2">and even differential entrance between</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.340" end="01:19:57.139" style="s2">loans and deposits means that there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.480" end="01:19:59.270" style="s2">this redistribution process that shovels</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.139" end="01:20:02.389" style="s2">money from the bottom of the pyramid to</p>

<p begin="01:20:02.389" end="01:20:07.219" style="s2">of the pyramid has been going on since</p>

<p begin="01:20:07.219" end="01:20:14.119" style="s2">in the 1600 and that is structurally</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.030" end="01:20:17.510" style="s2">dysfunctional we did we need to redesign</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.119" end="01:20:21.170" style="s2">the way money functions in a way that it</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.510" end="01:20:23.719" style="s2">actually incentivizes us to be</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.310" end="01:24:19.900" style="s2">think thanks for for corroborating that</p>

<p begin="01:24:19.900" end="01:24:24.190" style="s2">because I have the same feeling yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.180" end="01:24:25.990" style="s2">fact I do do the occasional deep dive</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.190" end="01:24:28.570" style="s2">into something and as I mentioned on</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.990" end="01:24:30.760" style="s2">this show before late last year I taught</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.570" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">myself rust which is the computer</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.760" end="01:24:35.860" style="s2">programming language that&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.040" end="01:24:38.440" style="s2">understand and use to operate in holo</p>

<p begin="01:24:38.440" end="01:24:43.750" style="s2">that I could actually dabble in a whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.180" end="01:24:47.500" style="s2">a chain this year and and while I&#39;m 100%</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.750" end="01:24:50.050" style="s2">with you on their their philosophy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.500" end="01:24:52.390" style="s2">the best I&#39;ve ever seen I do have some</p>

<p begin="01:24:52.390" end="01:24:57.640" style="s2">technical details and the only way to</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.000" end="01:24:59.410" style="s2">find out if I if my just sort of sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.640" end="01:25:01.000" style="s2">is right or wrong is actually just jump</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.410" end="01:25:03.040" style="s2">in and do it so I&#39;m gonna hack together</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.000" end="01:25:05.680" style="s2">some whole chain stuff probably by mid</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.040" end="01:25:08.020" style="s2">year and then I&#39;ll have a deeper view I</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.680" end="01:25:09.340" style="s2">hope it&#39;s good I hope it&#39;s good or could</p>

<p begin="01:25:11.230" end="01:25:15.040" style="s2">and give them your feedback I think they</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.030" end="01:25:16.890" style="s2">would love it yeah in fact I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.040" end="01:25:19.060" style="s2">get this brought guy on my podcast</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.890" end="01:25:20.860" style="s2">alright now this is one I&#39;m sure my</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.060" end="01:25:23.380" style="s2">regular listeners have been waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.860" end="01:25:25.720" style="s2">let&#39;s turn to something that I am sort</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.380" end="01:25:30.250" style="s2">of well known for which is my skepticism</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.720" end="01:25:32.230" style="s2">about the word spirituality in fact my</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.250" end="01:25:33.700" style="s2">listeners know that I usually call it</p>

<p begin="01:25:33.700" end="01:25:37.330" style="s2">we could go on endlessly on this topic</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.560" end="01:25:39.880" style="s2">but there was a lot more of that than I</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.330" end="01:25:42.940" style="s2">was expecting in your book and I must</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.880" end="01:25:47.620" style="s2">confess it makes me uneasy when I see</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.940" end="01:25:50.630" style="s2">that much about spirituality but before</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.620" end="01:25:53.270" style="s2">I push back why don&#39;t you make your case</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.630" end="01:25:54.949" style="s2">well again to that I mentioned it</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.270" end="01:25:58.099" style="s2">earlier briefly that conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.949" end="01:26:00.050" style="s2">David or in 2006 he said something</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.099" end="01:26:03.050" style="s2">really interesting back then to that</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.050" end="01:26:05.270" style="s2">question where he also said we need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.050" end="01:26:07.099" style="s2">figure out why we&#39;re worth sustaining</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.270" end="01:26:09.790" style="s2">and he said that you can kind of make</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.099" end="01:26:12.739" style="s2">like he said it&#39;s not a question of</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.790" end="01:26:14.329" style="s2">whether we are spiritual beings or not</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.739" end="01:26:18.579" style="s2">it is whether we&#39;re authentically</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.329" end="01:26:21.110" style="s2">spiritual in the sense that you can make</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.579" end="01:26:23.329" style="s2">soccer your religion you can make</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.500" end="01:26:34.610" style="s2">deeper search for meaning is at the root</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.940" end="01:26:37.610" style="s2">of what it means to be human if you look</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.610" end="01:26:41.000" style="s2">at the very first cave paintings that</p>

<p begin="01:26:51.860" end="01:26:58.159" style="s2">don&#39;t think we will ever get away from</p>

<p begin="01:26:58.159" end="01:27:05.960" style="s2">or another and science only offers a</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.050" end="01:27:08.780" style="s2">very useful but a limited answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.960" end="01:27:12.320" style="s2">and another way of framing it is one of</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.780" end="01:27:16.190" style="s2">my mentors Satish Kumar who found her to</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.320" end="01:27:18.710" style="s2">Maha College and he said that you can</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.190" end="01:27:22.190" style="s2">take two pathways into this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.710" end="01:27:24.409" style="s2">either you take the pathway of ecology</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.190" end="01:27:27.530" style="s2">and if you really understand the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.409" end="01:27:31.099" style="s2">complexity and the the interconnections</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.530" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">and the patterns of which in which the</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.099" end="01:27:37.159" style="s2">whole and apart relate through an</p>

<p begin="01:27:37.159" end="01:27:41.150" style="s2">an understanding of the larger cycles</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.110" end="01:27:45.710" style="s2">that were part of them even beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.150" end="01:27:48.590" style="s2">the planetary limits the that they were</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.710" end="01:27:51.409" style="s2">literally made out of Stardust and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.590" end="01:27:53.540" style="s2">think that&#39;s a deeply spiritual insight</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.409" end="01:27:55.670" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s what what what Thomas</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.540" end="01:27:57.920" style="s2">berry explored with with how can we</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.670" end="01:27:59.869" style="s2">retell the universe story using science</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.920" end="01:28:02.750" style="s2">in a way that we re enchant the universe</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.869" end="01:28:03.980" style="s2">and we don&#39;t stick with this this dogma</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.750" end="01:28:07.580" style="s2">of the rational</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.980" end="01:28:09.770" style="s2">scientists that of that did matter and</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.580" end="01:28:11.720" style="s2">in life and consciousness evolving out</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.770" end="01:28:15.500" style="s2">of it and that we already addressed</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.720" end="01:28:18.080" style="s2">briefly so I for me spirituality I agree</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.500" end="01:28:21.620" style="s2">that it it it can get really woolly and</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.080" end="01:28:24.220" style="s2">fuzzy and can be an S word that makes</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.620" end="01:28:29.000" style="s2">things complicated but the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.220" end="01:28:31.489" style="s2">quest for meaning for exploring our role</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.000" end="01:28:32.060" style="s2">and relationship right relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.489" end="01:28:35.870" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.060" end="01:28:39.230" style="s2">and to the larger being that were taking</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.870" end="01:28:42.380" style="s2">experience in is critical to leading a</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.230" end="01:28:44.090" style="s2">meaningful life I believe and we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.380" end="01:28:48.170" style="s2">call it spirituality if that makes it</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.090" end="01:28:51.680" style="s2">easier people know I&#39;ve had debates I</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.170" end="01:28:53.600" style="s2">even had my producer on the show Jared</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.680" end="01:28:55.370" style="s2">Jaynes we had a great episode not long</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.600" end="01:28:58.130" style="s2">ago about spirituality is a strong</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.370" end="01:28:59.960" style="s2">spirituality guy he produces and edits</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.130" end="01:29:01.970" style="s2">all my podcasts and he and I had a good</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.960" end="01:29:04.610" style="s2">argument about it was kind of fun but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.970" end="01:29:06.440" style="s2">guess where I come out on it is you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.610" end="01:29:08.810" style="s2">put my cards on the table I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.440" end="01:29:10.880" style="s2">scientific realist in fact I go so far</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.810" end="01:29:13.190" style="s2">as to say I am a naive realist</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.880" end="01:29:14.930" style="s2">I believe the universe is there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.190" end="01:29:16.550" style="s2">more or less though certainly we have</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.930" end="01:29:19.370" style="s2">lots of errors in our science and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.550" end="01:29:22.430" style="s2">highly incomplete and it&#39;s not enchanted</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.370" end="01:29:24.860" style="s2">there is no fancy not supernatural stuff</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.430" end="01:29:26.300" style="s2">at least not within our universe you</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.860" end="01:29:28.550" style="s2">know the bigger question why is there</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.300" end="01:29:31.280" style="s2">something other than nothing that one</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.550" end="01:29:33.800" style="s2">haven&#39;t not a clue nor does science it</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.280" end="01:29:36.860" style="s2">may someday but this is where I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.800" end="01:29:38.870" style="s2">this not enchantment scientific realist</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.860" end="01:29:41.300" style="s2">perspectives fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.870" end="01:29:43.160" style="s2">we&#39;re okay with the fact that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.300" end="01:29:45.560" style="s2">know why the universe exists if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.160" end="01:29:47.150" style="s2">any point at all and we&#39;re okay with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.560" end="01:29:49.280" style="s2">fact that we can&#39;t explain a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.150" end="01:29:51.200" style="s2">things even some things that are seem</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.280" end="01:29:53.780" style="s2">fairly straightforward like dark matter</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.200" end="01:29:56.330" style="s2">dark energy we don&#39;t feel like we have</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.780" end="01:29:58.100" style="s2">to have this totalizing system right</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.330" end="01:30:00.320" style="s2">this tendency that people want to go to</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.100" end="01:30:02.210" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a cosmic consciousness of</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.320" end="01:30:03.410" style="s2">which we&#39;re all apart maybe there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.210" end="01:30:05.239" style="s2">maybe there isn&#39;t there&#39;s no damn</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.410" end="01:30:08.000" style="s2">evidence that we are at least no</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.239" end="01:30:10.940" style="s2">objective reproducible evidence yes we</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.000" end="01:30:13.160" style="s2">can have spiritual subjective feelings</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.940" end="01:30:15.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s true and again as I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.160" end="01:30:17.750" style="s2">many times before you know I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.380" end="01:30:21.200" style="s2">psychedelics including very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.750" end="01:30:25.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve done egodeath levels of LSD I can</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.200" end="01:30:26.900" style="s2">easily put myself in a non ego state but</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.430" end="01:30:29.690" style="s2">I can also interpret those things</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.900" end="01:30:31.610" style="s2">through cognitive science as essentially</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.690" end="01:30:33.680" style="s2">the confabulate er that part of our</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.610" end="01:30:36.110" style="s2">brain that tries to spin a story to make</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.680" end="01:30:38.390" style="s2">some sense out of our perceptions being</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.110" end="01:30:40.970" style="s2">applied to a non standard set of</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.390" end="01:30:43.490" style="s2">networks and rhythms in our brain and no</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.970" end="01:30:45.650" style="s2">more than that though also no less and</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.490" end="01:30:48.650" style="s2">so that&#39;s where I come out on</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.650" end="01:30:51.380" style="s2">spirituality and why it bothers me is</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.650" end="01:30:53.600" style="s2">that people get so sucked into it and</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.380" end="01:30:55.760" style="s2">spend so much of their life energy</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.600" end="01:30:57.800" style="s2">Dibble babbling around with their</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.760" end="01:30:59.840" style="s2">interior states when they should be</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.800" end="01:31:01.580" style="s2">going out to work goddamn it and solving</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.840" end="01:31:04.370" style="s2">all these problems we know we have in</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.580" end="01:31:06.680" style="s2">fact I recently stumbled upon a term</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.370" end="01:31:09.310" style="s2">which I&#39;d never heard before maybe two</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.680" end="01:31:11.450" style="s2">months ago called spiritual bypass</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.310" end="01:31:13.610" style="s2">apparently it means when people get so</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.450" end="01:31:15.590" style="s2">obsessed with the spirituality stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.610" end="01:31:16.040" style="s2">that they think that&#39;s the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.590" end="01:31:19.900" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.040" end="01:31:24.050" style="s2">when probably it isn&#39;t well I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.900" end="01:31:26.930" style="s2">been there done that just walked the</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.050" end="01:31:28.910" style="s2">spiral a couple of times on all that</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.930" end="01:31:32.630" style="s2">like I&#39;ve spent my time sitting on a</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.910" end="01:31:35.210" style="s2">cushion and meditating and I&#39;ve had long</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.630" end="01:31:36.860" style="s2">lots of arguments with people who will</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.210" end="01:31:38.390" style="s2">get so obsessed with this they say</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.860" end="01:31:40.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the only thing you can do you can</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.390" end="01:31:43.000" style="s2">own like the best way you can contribute</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.520" end="01:31:45.020" style="s2">to saving the future of humanity is</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.000" end="01:31:46.910" style="s2">working on yourself and sitting on a</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.020" end="01:31:49.150" style="s2">sofa I&#39;ve also done some of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.910" end="01:31:51.440" style="s2">explorations you just alluded to with</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.150" end="01:31:54.710" style="s2">psycho after they suffer the substances</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.440" end="01:31:58.150" style="s2">that have given me very inside full</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.710" end="01:32:02.150" style="s2">experiences of my deeper connection with</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.150" end="01:32:06.650" style="s2">life and the what what senses are</p>

<p begin="01:32:06.650" end="01:32:13.180" style="s2">feel that even within like if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.220" end="01:32:16.100" style="s2">take sort of a matter on a Varela</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.180" end="01:32:17.870" style="s2">Santiago theory of cognition type</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.100" end="01:32:20.210" style="s2">approach we just need that</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.870" end="01:32:22.130" style="s2">epistemological pluralism and and part</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.210" end="01:32:24.230" style="s2">of that is also that like you can take</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.130" end="01:32:26.620" style="s2">the science lens and that explains</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.230" end="01:32:29.480" style="s2">things in one way and you can take a</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.620" end="01:32:30.440" style="s2">another lens where you feel a deep</p>

<p begin="01:32:30.440" end="01:32:37.640" style="s2">with a living conscious universe and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.120" end="01:32:40.180" style="s2">don&#39;t think you need to necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.640" end="01:32:44.540" style="s2">justify that within the parameters of</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.180" end="01:32:47.150" style="s2">the scientific story if it&#39;s a fully</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.540" end="01:32:49.340" style="s2">embodied experience that that is</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.150" end="01:32:52.910" style="s2">meaningful to you that helps you</p>

<p begin="01:33:04.430" end="01:33:08.660" style="s2">don&#39;t really care you know we&#39;ll back</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.680" end="01:33:10.070" style="s2">off a little bit in the game be world we</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.660" end="01:33:12.050" style="s2">have a concept called psycho</p>

<p begin="01:33:20.630" end="01:33:25.010" style="s2">are all over the continuum but I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.130" end="01:33:28.130" style="s2">the consensus view is whatever works for</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.010" end="01:33:31.010" style="s2">you to be a better player of game be use</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.130" end="01:33:32.690" style="s2">it but be aware of the dangers and</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.010" end="01:33:35.239" style="s2">whether they&#39;re drug addiction or</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.690" end="01:33:36.890" style="s2">spiritual bypass or being becoming a</p>

<p begin="01:33:44.810" end="01:33:48.830" style="s2">better and that&#39;s where I finally now</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.600" end="01:33:50.420" style="s2">let me just pick you up a month one</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.830" end="01:33:53.300" style="s2">thing that you said earlier that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.420" end="01:33:54.980" style="s2">this and again I&#39;m sitting with a</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.300" end="01:33:59.150" style="s2">question I&#39;m not not trying to lecture</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.980" end="01:34:03.080" style="s2">anybody here it&#39;s the framing of theory</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.150" end="01:34:05.210" style="s2">and practice or even spirituality and</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.080" end="01:34:07.790" style="s2">practice like you said like don&#39;t sit on</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.210" end="01:34:09.739" style="s2">the cushion and and and go into that in</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.790" end="01:34:14.630" style="s2">a journey and go out there in the world</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.739" end="01:34:16.969" style="s2">and do something and well if even using</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.630" end="01:34:18.500" style="s2">a Sun at a scientific entry point here</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.969" end="01:34:21.190" style="s2">if everything is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.500" end="01:34:24.620" style="s2">interconnected through non-local</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.190" end="01:34:28.340" style="s2">connections and then every state change</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.620" end="01:34:34.280" style="s2">in me is also a state change in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.340" end="01:34:36.110" style="s2">known universe and therefore we in this</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.280" end="01:34:39.140" style="s2">conversation that we are having right</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.110" end="01:34:41.060" style="s2">now this conversation has causal agency</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.140" end="01:34:43.880" style="s2">in and of itself whether somebody</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.060" end="01:34:46.040" style="s2">listens to it or not right now in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.880" end="01:34:49.489" style="s2">because your universe and I&#39;m universe</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.040" end="01:34:52.969" style="s2">and therefore we need to pay more</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.489" end="01:34:54.770" style="s2">attention to the power of the word and</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.969" end="01:34:58.070" style="s2">the power of thought and the power of</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.770" end="01:35:00.590" style="s2">our state of being so this dualism</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.070" end="01:35:02.750" style="s2">between being and doing like actually is</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.590" end="01:35:04.940" style="s2">maybe a false dualism or the dualism</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.750" end="01:35:08.090" style="s2">between theory and practice if we if we</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.940" end="01:35:10.850" style="s2">find new organizing ideas new frameworks</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.090" end="01:35:13.179" style="s2">that help us understand this</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.850" end="01:35:17.870" style="s2">participation in complexity then we</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.179" end="01:35:20.480" style="s2">already shift the very thing we are part</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.870" end="01:35:20.989" style="s2">of like it&#39;s like in Medrano and very</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.480" end="01:35:23.889" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.989" end="01:35:27.620" style="s2">terms is we are bringing forth a world</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.889" end="01:35:30.440" style="s2">together and taking the rationalist</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.620" end="01:35:35.150" style="s2">scientific frame brings forth one one</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.440" end="01:35:37.250" style="s2">world and taking a indigenous wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.150" end="01:35:40.429" style="s2">frame brings forth another world and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.250" end="01:35:42.620" style="s2">think both of them have something to</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.429" end="01:35:45.110" style="s2">learn from each other yeah I would agree</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.620" end="01:35:47.239" style="s2">well not as Polly as I&#39;ve gotten deeper</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.110" end="01:35:50.090" style="s2">into this world I am more tolerant and</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.239" end="01:35:53.300" style="s2">understand why it helps people to use</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.090" end="01:35:56.210" style="s2">these subjective tools but I just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.300" end="01:35:58.699" style="s2">always careful to say subjectively and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.210" end="01:36:01.850" style="s2">think you said fully embodied people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.699" end="01:36:04.480" style="s2">subjective sense is there&#39;s no one can</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.850" end="01:36:07.340" style="s2">ever no one should ever second-guess</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.480" end="01:36:10.310" style="s2">someones subjective experience right</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.340" end="01:36:12.679" style="s2">where I get my back up a little bit is</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.310" end="01:36:15.350" style="s2">when they then start making claims about</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.679" end="01:36:18.560" style="s2">the world that are objectively</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.350" end="01:36:20.480" style="s2">verifiable or not and you&#39;ve heard these</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.560" end="01:36:23.150" style="s2">woowoo people says sleeping under a pier</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.480" end="01:36:25.159" style="s2">mineral cure diabetes or something right</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.150" end="01:36:26.960" style="s2">actually no a hippie chick that tried</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.159" end="01:36:30.739" style="s2">that guess what she went she went blind</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.960" end="01:36:32.750" style="s2">right so when one wants to say that one</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.739" end="01:36:35.060" style="s2">has a subjective life and it&#39;s more real</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.750" end="01:36:36.949" style="s2">than anything else to us right and this</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.060" end="01:36:38.300" style="s2">is something we&#39;re Hansie fry enact I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.949" end="01:36:41.659" style="s2">really gotten a lot out of his books</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.300" end="01:36:44.179" style="s2">makes the point again and again that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.659" end="01:36:46.219" style="s2">know our subjective well-being is more</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.179" end="01:36:48.760" style="s2">real to us than anything else and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.219" end="01:36:51.920" style="s2">well and good but then don&#39;t feel the</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.760" end="01:36:54.850" style="s2">need to then go from that to claims</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.920" end="01:36:57.290" style="s2">about objective reality which can be</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.850" end="01:36:57.710" style="s2">verified because I like to point out to</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.290" end="01:36:59.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.710" end="01:37:02.360" style="s2">in the contest between metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.480" end="01:37:04.730" style="s2">speculation and objective reality the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.360" end="01:37:08.510" style="s2">meta physicians have always had it wrong</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.730" end="01:37:10.700" style="s2">Thor does not cause thunder no the Sun</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.510" end="01:37:13.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go around the earth you know no</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.700" end="01:37:16.070" style="s2">the earth isn&#39;t 6,000 years old anytime</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.700" end="01:37:18.860" style="s2">the two have come together objective</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.070" end="01:37:20.570" style="s2">measurements of reality have always with</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.860" end="01:37:23.000" style="s2">one or two minor exceptions that you can</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.570" end="01:37:26.480" style="s2">put down to chance defeated metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.000" end="01:37:29.420" style="s2">speculation so my view is enjoy one</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.480" end="01:37:31.090" style="s2">subjective fully embodied being but then</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.420" end="01:37:33.080" style="s2">don&#39;t leap from there to making</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.090" end="01:37:34.190" style="s2">metaphysical speculations about the</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.080" end="01:37:37.280" style="s2">physical world</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.190" end="01:37:38.900" style="s2">mmm an interesting thing coming back to</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.280" end="01:37:40.640" style="s2">bran guru and Bryan always pointed out</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.900" end="01:37:43.280" style="s2">that science isn&#39;t about objectivity</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.640" end="01:37:46.700" style="s2">it&#39;s about into subjective consensus</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.280" end="01:37:48.680" style="s2">making and that it&#39;s basically a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.700" end="01:37:52.390" style="s2">of people are agreeing to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.680" end="01:37:56.320" style="s2">methodology a certain epistemology and</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.390" end="01:37:59.090" style="s2">then working within that to reproduce</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.320" end="01:38:01.100" style="s2">certain outcomes to certain experiments</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.090" end="01:38:03.160" style="s2">and and that&#39;s verifiable and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.100" end="01:38:07.870" style="s2">what I think you&#39;re referring to as</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.160" end="01:38:12.190" style="s2">objective but that there is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.870" end="01:38:15.969" style="s2">participatory agency of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.190" end="01:38:19.670" style="s2">everything that we bring forth that</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.969" end="01:38:22.760" style="s2">perception isn&#39;t a process of opening</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.670" end="01:38:24.920" style="s2">the eyes and the world just comes in and</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.760" end="01:38:27.320" style="s2">the worlds out there but it is every act</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.920" end="01:38:29.870" style="s2">of perception has an act of conception</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.320" end="01:38:33.050" style="s2">in it and if we pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.870" end="01:38:36.260" style="s2">seer the role of the seer in the way we</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.050" end="01:38:38.960" style="s2">access reality then we can allow for</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.260" end="01:38:42.260" style="s2">that epistemological pluralism a little</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.960" end="01:38:45.860" style="s2">bit more by saying okay maybe there are</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.260" end="01:38:47.810" style="s2">other ways of generating insight and and</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.860" end="01:38:51.400" style="s2">I quite like that framing that own</p>

<p begin="01:39:05.840" end="01:39:09.590" style="s2">there&#39;s the the kind of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.489" end="01:39:11.059" style="s2">separation from that that gives us all</p>

<p begin="01:39:13.989" end="01:39:19.489" style="s2">part of this kind of evolutionary leap</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.760" end="01:39:21.610" style="s2">that that we need to make that that rite</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.489" end="01:39:25.400" style="s2">of passage into appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.610" end="01:39:27.730" style="s2">participation is to come to final</p>

<p begin="01:39:35.270" end="01:39:38.150" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s good that we have some</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.530" end="01:39:40.370" style="s2">diversity and you know again one of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.150" end="01:39:43.130" style="s2">game be things that we talk about a fair</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.370" end="01:39:45.020" style="s2">amount is coherent pluralism we need to</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.130" end="01:39:48.050" style="s2">agree to some things and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.020" end="01:39:49.610" style="s2">agree to disagree about other things and</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.050" end="01:39:51.739" style="s2">I suspect this is going to be the one of</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.610" end="01:39:53.750" style="s2">the ones that you and I are right this</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.739" end="01:39:55.280" style="s2">conversations been good I can see more</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.750" end="01:39:57.290" style="s2">overlap but I think that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.280" end="01:39:59.030" style="s2">fight we will just have some things we</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.290" end="01:40:00.980" style="s2">disagree about here and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.030" end="01:40:02.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing I love love the</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.980" end="01:40:07.040" style="s2">spirit you take it and I think if we all</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.540" end="01:40:09.230" style="s2">could take our disagreements a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.040" end="01:40:11.660" style="s2">in that spirit we would so so much more</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.230" end="01:40:13.340" style="s2">easily learn from each other because I</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.660" end="01:40:15.200" style="s2">mean you&#39;re making me think and reflect</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.340" end="01:40:18.020" style="s2">with with you perspective and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.200" end="01:40:20.300" style="s2">just me voicing a different one here</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.020" end="01:40:23.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like this will work in me for for a</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.300" end="01:40:25.100" style="s2">while that&#39;s I heard you yeah not same</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.450" end="01:40:27.350" style="s2">with the same with you and also same</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.100" end="01:40:29.330" style="s2">with Hansie yeah both of you have said</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.350" end="01:40:30.950" style="s2">alright you know I think I&#39;m a smart guy</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.330" end="01:40:31.489" style="s2">but you know these guys are smart guys</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.950" end="01:40:33.110" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.489" end="01:40:35.719" style="s2">well let me think about this right</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.110" end="01:40:36.650" style="s2">alright last topic unfortunately I think</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.719" end="01:40:40.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to skip over</p>

<p begin="01:40:40.280" end="01:40:42.830" style="s2">back again just talking about</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.210" end="01:40:44.150" style="s2">consciousness yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.830" end="01:40:46.700" style="s2">another conversation on consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.150" end="01:40:49.070" style="s2">sometimes without a doubt the last one I</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.700" end="01:40:50.450" style="s2">this is something that is very near and</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.070" end="01:40:53.570" style="s2">dear to my heart because I actually made</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.450" end="01:40:56.660" style="s2">a mistake here in the early one point oh</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.570" end="01:40:58.760" style="s2">version of game be back in 2013 where</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.660" end="01:41:01.160" style="s2">there was a dichotomy in the community</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.760" end="01:41:04.130" style="s2">between people need to change or evolve</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.160" end="01:41:07.430" style="s2">their consciousness first versus we need</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.130" end="01:41:10.489" style="s2">to build institutions first and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.430" end="01:41:12.920" style="s2">lines got drawn very firmly and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.489" end="01:41:14.540" style="s2">factions went to war and that was one of</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.920" end="01:41:19.370" style="s2">a couple of reasons why the original</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.540" end="01:41:20.810" style="s2">game be 1.0 exploded into dust at the</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.370" end="01:41:23.000" style="s2">end of 2013</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.810" end="01:41:25.910" style="s2">fortunately we were smart we said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.000" end="01:41:27.590" style="s2">gonna go into spore mode here everyone</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.910" end="01:41:29.210" style="s2">just take whatever they&#39;re at with game</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.590" end="01:41:31.640" style="s2">B go out in the world and do your thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.210" end="01:41:35.540" style="s2">maybe someday the spores will regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.640" end="01:41:37.640" style="s2">and by odd chance in the spring of 2019</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.540" end="01:41:40.700" style="s2">that some of those spores started to</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.640" end="01:41:42.260" style="s2">sprout again but since that time you can</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.700" end="01:41:43.310" style="s2">probably guess which side I was on and</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.260" end="01:41:47.390" style="s2">now and I was definitely an</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.310" end="01:41:48.920" style="s2">institution&#39;s first person and I screw</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.390" end="01:41:51.969" style="s2">all that people changing them</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.920" end="01:41:55.040" style="s2"> all that bunch of sissy right</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.969" end="01:41:58.280" style="s2">now I realize I was wrong but they were</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.040" end="01:42:01.219" style="s2">wrong too and in reality it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.280" end="01:42:02.449" style="s2">coevolution between the two how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.219" end="01:42:05.239" style="s2">seeing it I think more and more people</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.449" end="01:42:08.320" style="s2">and in our world are seeing it which is</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.239" end="01:42:11.179" style="s2">that there are a few people who can</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.320" end="01:42:13.340" style="s2">change themselves despite the</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.179" end="01:42:15.920" style="s2">institution&#39;s they&#39;re embedded in but</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.340" end="01:42:18.140" style="s2">those few people are small one or two</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.920" end="01:42:21.080" style="s2">percent maybe the classic early adopters</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.140" end="01:42:24.739" style="s2">are maniac innovators in the technology</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.080" end="01:42:27.650" style="s2">space or consumer product space but most</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.739" end="01:42:29.719" style="s2">humans really aren&#39;t able to make much</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.650" end="01:42:33.230" style="s2">of a deep change in themselves unless</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.719" end="01:42:35.870" style="s2">they&#39;re reinforced by appropriate social</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.230" end="01:42:39.620" style="s2">signals so the job is for these early</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.870" end="01:42:41.570" style="s2">people to change themselves enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.620" end="01:42:45.469" style="s2">able to build some institutions that</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.570" end="01:42:49.130" style="s2">work for them but then emanate signals</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.469" end="01:42:51.140" style="s2">such that they start to enable other</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.130" end="01:42:52.880" style="s2">people to change you know this is kind</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.140" end="01:42:55.280" style="s2">of abstract but you know say somebody</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.880" end="01:42:58.130" style="s2">who is living a middle-class suburban</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.280" end="01:43:01.310" style="s2">life and their ambition in life is to</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.130" end="01:43:03.710" style="s2">trade up from you know see a Mercedes</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.310" end="01:43:05.690" style="s2">c-class store Mercedes e-class right</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.710" end="01:43:07.910" style="s2">they&#39;re getting that signal that</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.690" end="01:43:10.820" style="s2">organizes their life there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.910" end="01:43:12.830" style="s2">alternative today and Western society or</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.820" end="01:43:15.469" style="s2">at least they&#39;re very fringy expose</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.830" end="01:43:19.480" style="s2">instead we have a set of signals around</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.469" end="01:43:21.920" style="s2">conviviality around spirituality around</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.480" end="01:43:24.320" style="s2">experiencing nature and really being one</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.920" end="01:43:27.679" style="s2">with it and those are real signals that</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.320" end="01:43:29.870" style="s2">actually provide meaning to people it is</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.679" end="01:43:32.719" style="s2">possible to seduce a greater proportion</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.870" end="01:43:34.790" style="s2">than one or two percent away from the</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.719" end="01:43:37.010" style="s2">game a institutions maybe we get to five</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.790" end="01:43:39.110" style="s2">or seven percent and then those five or</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.010" end="01:43:40.969" style="s2">seven percent but of course this is not</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.110" end="01:43:43.400" style="s2">step function this is all continuous</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.969" end="01:43:46.460" style="s2">develop new institutions that work for</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.400" end="01:43:49.699" style="s2">them which then seduce the next ring of</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.460" end="01:43:51.469" style="s2">people until we get to maybe 15% and</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.699" end="01:43:54.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reasons to believe from</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.469" end="01:43:57.050" style="s2">systems modeling that once you get 15%</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.199" end="01:43:59.980" style="s2">of people who&#39;ve abandoned the legacy</p>

<p begin="01:44:06.600" end="01:44:10.830" style="s2">people first versus institutions first</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.670" end="01:44:12.050" style="s2">thing which is neither they got a</p>

<p begin="01:44:12.050" end="01:44:18.000" style="s2">sounds like a wonderful both and</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.150" end="01:44:21.690" style="s2">insulate because I would I would agree</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.000" end="01:44:24.360" style="s2">and as you were saying that what words</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.690" end="01:44:27.960" style="s2">came to my mind was what is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.360" end="01:44:30.840" style="s2">appropriate scale of organization and</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.960" end="01:44:35.820" style="s2">one thing that I&#39;ve been working with a</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.840" end="01:44:39.870" style="s2">lot and my explorations of all of this</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.820" end="01:44:41.490" style="s2">is this idea of scale linking design and</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.870" end="01:44:45.060" style="s2">the scales of design from kind of</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.490" end="01:44:46.890" style="s2">products to the material science what do</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.060" end="01:44:50.000" style="s2">we make stuff out of and what energy do</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.890" end="01:44:52.070" style="s2">we use but then on to products and and</p>

<p begin="01:45:14.790" end="01:45:19.080" style="s2">at the straight lines of many of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.520" end="01:45:21.690" style="s2">countries borders you can very clearly</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.080" end="01:45:25.710" style="s2">see how they were drawn by the rulers of</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.690" end="01:45:28.350" style="s2">some normally a colonial power and if we</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.710" end="01:45:32.190" style="s2">want to rematch the human presence on</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.350" end="01:45:34.800" style="s2">earth to the biophysical reality of life</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.190" end="01:45:37.740" style="s2">as a planetary process then we need to</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.800" end="01:45:39.630" style="s2">somehow stop taking these relatively</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.740" end="01:45:42.150" style="s2">artificial socially constructed</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.630" end="01:45:45.600" style="s2">boundaries these borders less seriously</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.150" end="01:45:48.060" style="s2">and understand our common family being</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.600" end="01:45:50.700" style="s2">part of the human species and the wider</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.060" end="01:45:54.330" style="s2">community of life being primary and that</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.700" end="01:45:56.760" style="s2">the patterns of rematching might just be</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.330" end="01:45:59.760" style="s2">more biophysical patterns like a</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.760" end="01:46:02.580" style="s2">watershed like a bio region and that at</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.760" end="01:46:04.980" style="s2">that scale we can more easily both</p>

<p begin="01:46:23.210" end="01:46:28.700" style="s2">that and lots of people have had this</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.150" end="01:46:30.620" style="s2">intuition a long time ago you can start</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.700" end="01:46:32.690" style="s2">with people like Patrick Geddes at the</p>

<p begin="01:46:59.120" end="01:47:03.980" style="s2">the locus of focus for this work is at</p>
