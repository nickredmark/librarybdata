<p begin="00:00:04.350" end="00:00:09.540" style="s2">think is a relatively way new way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.270" end="00:00:11.400" style="s2">looking at your experience but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.540" end="00:00:14.910" style="s2">even more broadly than that a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.400" end="00:00:19.500" style="s2">looking at reality itself you all come</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.910" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">my two University I suppose to make your</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.500" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">conceptions of reality more</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:25.260" style="s2">sophisticated and you want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">because you have to live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.260" end="00:00:30.830" style="s2">and the more sophisticated your</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:34.110" style="s2">conceptions the less likely you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.830" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">encounter tragic or harmful</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.110" end="00:00:39.750" style="s2">circumstances that you will be unable to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">deal with it really matters if you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.750" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">what you&#39;re thinking and you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:49.010" style="s2">think over the last twenty years I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">say there&#39;s been a revolution in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.010" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">psychology and the revolution has</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:56.010" style="s2">involved the transformation in the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">that we look at the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.010" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">what I want to talk to you about today I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">entitled this talk reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">sacred it&#39;s a strange title for a talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">to modern people because we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:07.950" style="s2">understand what the sacred means unless</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">we live within a worldview that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.950" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">essentially I wouldn&#39;t say archaic but</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">at least traditional for modern free</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">thinking fundamentally liberal people</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">the idea the sacred is anachronistic or</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">if not anachronism comprehensible so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">want to start with a story from the Old</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:29.400" style="s2">Testament there&#39;s a scene in the Old</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">Testament when the ancient Hebrews are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.400" end="00:01:34.490" style="s2">moving the Ark of the Covenant and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:37.079" style="s2">Ark of the Covenant is a device that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.490" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">manufactured in order to contain the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.079" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">Word of God and there was a rule among</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:43.409" style="s2">the ancient Hebrews which was you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">not to touch the Ark of the Covenant no</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.409" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">matter what and there&#39;s a story in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">Old Testament where the bearers of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">Ark of the Covenant they used to carry</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">it the bearers of the Ark of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">Covenant trip and a man reaches out to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">steady it and when he touches it God</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">strikes him dead and modern people look</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">at a story like that and the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">they think is that seems a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">harsh on the part of God given that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.210" style="s2">man was attempting to do something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:15.640" style="s2">he believed was good</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.210" end="00:02:18.580" style="s2">but what the story is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.640" end="00:02:20.200" style="s2">indicate in my opinion is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.580" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">certain things that you touch at your</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.200" end="00:02:26.260" style="s2">peril regardless of your intentions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:28.810" style="s2">those things that you touch at your</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.260" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">peril regardless of your intentions most</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.810" end="00:02:34.630" style="s2">cultures regard as sacred as untouchable</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:36.700" style="s2">I want to make a case for you today that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.630" end="00:02:38.530" style="s2">those things exist and also why they</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.700" end="00:02:41.110" style="s2">exist and why it&#39;s necessary for you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.530" end="00:02:44.020" style="s2">know that they exist I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.110" end="00:02:45.790" style="s2">that if you&#39;re properly educated in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.020" end="00:02:47.590" style="s2">university especially with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.790" end="00:02:49.960" style="s2">the humanities which are in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.590" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">conceptual trouble at the moment what</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.960" end="00:02:53.140" style="s2">you are what essentially happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:55.750" style="s2">is that you&#39;re introduced in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.140" end="00:02:57.790" style="s2">relatively secular way to the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.750" end="00:03:00.250" style="s2">the sacred you&#39;re here in the university</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.790" end="00:03:04.120" style="s2">to learn about the eternal values of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.250" end="00:03:06.160" style="s2">humankind and I think that people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.120" end="00:03:08.170" style="s2">tell you that those values do not exist</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.160" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">or that they&#39;re endlessly debatable do</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.170" end="00:03:14.260" style="s2">you an unbelievable disservice now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:18.130" style="s2">gonna tell you first how you think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.260" end="00:03:19.450" style="s2">the world I think so this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.130" end="00:03:22.510" style="s2">Newtonian view of the world its</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.450" end="00:03:24.580" style="s2">Newtonian and deterministic and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.510" end="00:03:26.350" style="s2">worldview that dominated psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.580" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">economics and anthropology and political</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.350" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">science you name it for probably 400</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:36.010" style="s2">years but it&#39;s coming to a crashing halt</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">in the last 50 years and the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.010" end="00:03:41.080" style="s2">of that consequences of that have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:42.820" style="s2">manifested in a number of domains the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.080" end="00:03:46.390" style="s2">old world presuppositions are something</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.820" end="00:03:49.180" style="s2">like this the world is made out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.390" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">objects when you look at the world you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.180" end="00:03:53.470" style="s2">see the objects there they are in front</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:56.770" style="s2">of you as a consequence of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.470" end="00:03:59.140" style="s2">objects you think about what to do and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.770" end="00:04:02.740" style="s2">after you think about what to do in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.140" end="00:04:04.900" style="s2">presence of the objects you act now that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.740" end="00:04:05.440" style="s2">seems self-evident because when you look</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:08.380" style="s2">at the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:11.320" style="s2">they&#39;re the objects are and it appears</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.380" end="00:04:14.650" style="s2">to you that you see them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.320" end="00:04:19.540" style="s2">think about them and then you act but</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.650" end="00:04:23.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a real problem with that first</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.540" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">problem is use half your brain to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">literally human visual cortex</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:30.770" style="s2">very large part of your brain and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">reason that the visual cortex is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.770" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">large is that seeing is as far as we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:38.900" style="s2">tell actually impossible now the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:40.939" style="s2">that seeing perception is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.900" end="00:04:43.849" style="s2">wasn&#39;t discovered by psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.939" end="00:04:45.500" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t discovered by philosophers it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.849" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">was discovered by people who working who</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.500" end="00:04:48.949" style="s2">were working on artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:51.469" style="s2">and trying to make artificially</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.949" end="00:04:52.729" style="s2">intelligent machines the presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.469" end="00:04:55.219" style="s2">of the people who were making</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.729" end="00:04:57.050" style="s2">intelligent machines was the hard part</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.219" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">of interacting with the world is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.050" end="00:05:01.580" style="s2">figuring out what to do once you see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:03.319" style="s2">objects but it turned out that making</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.580" end="00:05:06.050" style="s2">machines that could see objects was</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.319" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">impossible and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.050" end="00:05:10.250" style="s2">that boundaries between objects are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:12.229" style="s2">obvious they&#39;re not obvious at all in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.250" end="00:05:14.030" style="s2">fact it&#39;s very difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.229" end="00:05:18.050" style="s2">how it is that we separate things up at</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.030" end="00:05:20.900" style="s2">all now let me give you an example and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.050" end="00:05:22.190" style="s2">so if you think about yourself when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.900" end="00:05:23.719" style="s2">look in the mirror you see yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.190" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">an object you see your eyes you see your</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.719" end="00:05:27.979" style="s2">nose you see your face you see your body</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:30.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s pretty much what you see when</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.979" end="00:05:31.879" style="s2">you look at other people but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.199" end="00:05:35.000" style="s2">all there is to you in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.879" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">hardly any of what there is to you so</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.000" end="00:05:39.830" style="s2">you could say for example you exist at</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:41.330" style="s2">the level of the quantum particle you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.830" end="00:05:43.250" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive that in fact people</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.330" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that until 75 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.250" end="00:05:48.349" style="s2">above that level you exist at an atomic</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:50.659" style="s2">level and then a molecular level and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.349" end="00:05:52.430" style="s2">then you exist at the level of complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.659" end="00:05:56.270" style="s2">organs and then the interactions between</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.430" end="00:05:58.250" style="s2">those organs and then you and then your</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.270" end="00:06:01.490" style="s2">family and then the groups that your</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:03.650" style="s2">family belong to and then the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.490" end="00:06:06.139" style="s2">that the groups of your are that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.650" end="00:06:06.409" style="s2">all your groups belong to and on and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.139" end="00:06:09.169" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.409" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">so on and so forth until what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.169" end="00:06:15.229" style="s2">you are can expand to encompass</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:17.479" style="s2">virtually anything now when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.229" end="00:06:18.770" style="s2">yourself you don&#39;t see that you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.479" end="00:06:20.060" style="s2">yourself at a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.770" end="00:06:21.589" style="s2">resolution when you look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.060" end="00:06:23.539" style="s2">you see yourself at a certain level of</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.539" end="00:06:28.909" style="s2">are equally real and equally relevant</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.849" end="00:06:30.469" style="s2">and we in fact have very little idea how</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.909" end="00:06:34.849" style="s2">it is that you&#39;re only able to see what</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.950" end="00:06:53.630" style="s2">about 40 years ago and the philosopher</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.810" end="00:07:05.600" style="s2">problem emerges to cause all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.910" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">trouble for people so for example when</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.600" end="00:07:09.860" style="s2">Henry Ford invented the automobile</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:11.450" style="s2">well at least invented the modern</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.860" end="00:07:13.400" style="s2">procedure of building the automobile</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.450" end="00:07:14.630" style="s2">what Ford presumed was that he was</p>

<p begin="00:07:19.300" end="00:07:25.790" style="s2">there were other unintended consequences</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.340" end="00:07:27.200" style="s2">of Ford&#39;s discovery so for example Ford</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.790" end="00:07:29.540" style="s2">happened to be a great supporter of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.200" end="00:07:31.430" style="s2">fascism and the reason that he was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.540" end="00:07:33.560" style="s2">supporter of fascism bit was because he</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.430" end="00:07:36.230" style="s2">regarded the fashion fascist political</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.560" end="00:07:37.820" style="s2">structure as a logical extension of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.230" end="00:07:40.760" style="s2">efficient methods that he&#39;d used to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.820" end="00:07:42.770" style="s2">assemble vehicles so his mode of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.760" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2">production was instantly manifested in a</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:52.700" style="s2">2009 a hundred years after the invention</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.660" end="00:07:54.860" style="s2">of the automobile we&#39;ve discovered some</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.700" end="00:07:56.570" style="s2">other things that the car was other than</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.570" end="00:08:00.500" style="s2">point B so for example it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.970" end="00:08:01.340" style="s2">the automobile and the internal</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.770" end="00:08:19.820" style="s2">was far more than what people thought it</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.410" end="00:08:37.160" style="s2">than you see the most ancient ideas we</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:08:57.439" style="s2">so if you think about things in their</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.439" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">think of things in their infinite number</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:06.019" style="s2">about that as one pole of reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.499" end="00:09:07.670" style="s2">it appears classically that people have</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.019" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">regarded their encounters with the</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">of Muhammad right the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.949" end="00:09:25.189" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to make an image and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:28.730" style="s2">among the ancient Hebrews the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.189" end="00:09:30.619" style="s2">very similar the Taoist say that you</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">means is that the absolute is always</p>

<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.829" style="s2">talking about it representing it making</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.790" end="00:09:47.209" style="s2">statues of it or idolizing it you lose</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.209" end="00:09:51.619" style="s2">because you&#39;ve turned it into something</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.889" end="00:09:53.149" style="s2">that&#39;s understandable in concrete part</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.559" end="00:10:11.209" style="s2">and you should keep firmly in mind that</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.209" end="00:10:15.079" style="s2">God in the modern world they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.949" end="00:10:17.059" style="s2">think about something that&#39;s more that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.079" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">more has more of the characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.059" end="00:10:20.600" style="s2">a being and I suppose that&#39;s where most</p>

<p begin="00:10:20.600" end="00:10:24.019" style="s2">comes in but the idea that there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.019" end="00:10:28.759" style="s2">perceptual capacity seems to me to be</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.759" end="00:10:33.350" style="s2">given what we know now about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.949" end="00:10:35.209" style="s2">of perception that the phenomena always</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.350" end="00:10:38.290" style="s2">transcends the manner in which you frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.209" end="00:10:40.970" style="s2">it we&#39;ve also come to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.290" end="00:10:42.889" style="s2">not only does reality have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.970" end="00:10:46.189" style="s2">levels of existence but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.889" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">perceive it you have to stand inside</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.189" end="00:10:51.319" style="s2">multiple frames this is a picture of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:55.220" style="s2">French city</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.319" end="00:10:57.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a walled city now the walls are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.220" end="00:10:59.329" style="s2">there to keep the people in and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.709" end="00:11:01.669" style="s2">walls are there to keep what isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.329" end="00:11:04.939" style="s2">the walls out and so you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.669" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">that as a protective structure now I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.939" end="00:11:08.540" style="s2">want to tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">is that you still inhabit a walled city</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.540" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">and exactly what that means so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:17.330" style="s2">example you think about this room tent</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:19.610" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.330" end="00:11:21.860" style="s2">this room allows you to see what it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.610" end="00:11:24.050" style="s2">that you see now when you&#39;re interacting</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.709" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">the computer and you find that as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.360" end="00:11:35.630" style="s2">general rule very annoying because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:38.029" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand the computer</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.630" end="00:11:40.209" style="s2">very well and you don&#39;t actually see how</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.029" end="00:11:42.290" style="s2">complex it is until it stops working</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.209" end="00:11:44.390" style="s2">most of the time when you&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.290" end="00:11:46.520" style="s2">with the world you&#39;re doing things with</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.520" end="00:11:50.660" style="s2">a way that produces some consequence</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.589" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">that you want and that means in part</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.660" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">that your perceptions are always framed</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:56.089" style="s2">by what you want and that&#39;s actually one</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.260" end="00:12:06.380" style="s2">applying a frame like that to the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.970" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">in order to simplify it enough so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.380" end="00:12:10.010" style="s2">you can understand it and you&#39;re aided</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:11.450" style="s2">in this process by all sorts of</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.450" end="00:12:15.020" style="s2">because when you look at the world you</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.250" end="00:12:16.610" style="s2">think well there are the objects but</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.020" end="00:12:19.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a thousand things going on</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.610" end="00:12:23.150" style="s2">before you make that judgment so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.490" end="00:12:25.820" style="s2">look at this room when you walk in here</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.710" end="00:15:08.440" style="s2">I would say that chaos is all those</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.080" end="00:24:49.610" style="s2">individuals from a psychological or</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.150" end="00:24:51.560" style="s2">mythological perspective knows that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.610" end="00:24:54.260" style="s2">limited and knows that he&#39;s doomed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.560" end="00:24:55.730" style="s2">both suffering and death in the Garden</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.260" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">of Gethsemane the night before his</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.730" end="00:24:59.780" style="s2">crucifixion he has an argument with God</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:01.940" style="s2">and the argument basically is do I</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.780" end="00:25:04.010" style="s2">actually have to do this and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.940" end="00:25:09.350" style="s2">is twofold well no actually you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.010" end="00:25:10.970" style="s2">have to accept your suffering but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.350" end="00:25:12.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have to voluntarily accept your</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.970" end="00:25:13.010" style="s2">suffering but there are consequences if</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.500" end="00:25:15.410" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:17.240" style="s2">now the Christian story is predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.410" end="00:25:18.430" style="s2">the idea that if you voluntarily accept</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.240" end="00:25:21.880" style="s2">your suffering you can simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.430" end="00:25:23.810" style="s2">transcend it it&#39;s a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.880" end="00:25:27.170" style="s2">philosophy and it&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.810" end="00:25:29.780" style="s2">we have very good support for from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.170" end="00:25:31.850" style="s2">psychological perspective so for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.780" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">if I&#39;m treating someone who has an</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.190" end="00:25:57.410" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid of and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.200" end="00:25:58.700" style="s2">physiologically if I force you to accept</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.700" end="00:26:02.660" style="s2">will go into emergency preparation mode</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.760" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">people have evolved two modes for</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:28.910" style="s2">voluntary approach and the other is</p>

<p begin="00:26:28.910" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">this representation you can see that</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.400" end="00:26:49.460" style="s2">like this that they don&#39;t notice I went</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.060" end="00:26:51.080" style="s2">to a museum in New York and there were a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.460" end="00:26:52.430" style="s2">very large number of paintings there</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.080" end="00:26:54.650" style="s2">from the late Renaissance and they were</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.430" end="00:27:08.090" style="s2">valuable paintings you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.200" end="00:27:10.370" style="s2">painted by Michelangelo or Leonardo da</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.090" end="00:27:11.720" style="s2">Vinci and each of them was probably</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.860" end="00:29:10.010" style="s2">interesting so you see the castle in the</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.600" end="00:29:24.050" style="s2">modern young people are often very</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:29.240" style="s2">because they see the fact that the world</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.160" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">to believe in them themselves it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.260" end="00:29:44.540" style="s2">easy for young people to look at the</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.540" end="00:29:48.770" style="s2">breaks but the truth of the matter is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:50.390" style="s2">that throughout human history tradition</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.770" end="00:29:52.220" style="s2">has always been anachronistic and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.390" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">out-of-date and what you see in images</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.220" end="00:29:56.330" style="s2">of st. George and the dragon is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:58.010" style="s2">Dragons always breach the walls which</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.330" end="00:30:01.100" style="s2">means that tradition is always under</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.010" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">attack from chaos well of course it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.100" end="00:30:04.850" style="s2">because the future is different than the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.530" style="s2">past but that doesn&#39;t mean that the past</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.850" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">should be abandoned because if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.530" end="00:30:11.060" style="s2">abandon the past and you knock down all</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.129" end="00:32:07.580" style="s2">note it&#39;s a medieval whale and of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.200" end="00:32:09.799" style="s2">medieval people didn&#39;t really know what</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:55.129" style="s2">better than no relationship at all and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.419" end="00:32:56.830" style="s2">then the person that you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.129" end="00:32:57.820" style="s2">relationship betrayed you and they</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.899" end="00:33:02.740" style="s2">anyways maybe they did that because</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.740" end="00:33:04.990" style="s2">did that because you&#39;re a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.789" end="00:33:08.830" style="s2">easy to get along with and as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.990" end="00:33:10.179" style="s2">consequence I&#39;d and so when they first</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.830" end="00:33:12.370" style="s2">leave you it&#39;s a catastrophe because</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.179" end="00:33:13.960" style="s2">your world falls apart but when your</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.370" end="00:33:16.510" style="s2">world falls apart you&#39;re somewhere new</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.960" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">as possible to learn something new in</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.510" end="00:33:19.149" style="s2">that place so you might learn for</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:20.590" style="s2">example that you should be a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.149" end="00:33:22.179" style="s2">sharper the next time that you go out</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.590" end="00:33:24.760" style="s2">with someone or you should be a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.179" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">bit more careful about picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.760" end="00:33:27.909" style="s2">clues that your partner&#39;s bored with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:30.279" style="s2">or that maybe you should stop</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.279" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">your life would be a lot more positive</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:37.899" style="s2">and stop thinking that you have the</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.899" end="00:33:42.279" style="s2">after redemption in the least and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.809" end="00:33:44.380" style="s2">that means now and then is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.279" end="00:33:46.029" style="s2">fall into the belly of a whale and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.380" end="00:33:48.549" style="s2">you&#39;re swallowed up by something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.029" end="00:33:50.769" style="s2">lurks underneath that you can come out</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.549" end="00:33:53.860" style="s2">the other side transformed and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.769" end="00:33:55.450" style="s2">actually how people learn every time you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.860" end="00:33:57.730" style="s2">learn something you learn because</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.450" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">something you did didn&#39;t work and that</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:05.800" style="s2">the case why bother with it and people</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.339" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">do ask that question and they ask it in</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.800" end="00:35:09.069" style="s2">ways that result in their own</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.780" end="00:35:14.590" style="s2">so for example people who become</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.180" end="00:42:25.269" style="s2">might think well perhaps there should be</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.269" end="00:42:41.890" style="s2">that claim in reality and I would say in</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.029" end="00:42:44.259" style="s2">a sense that&#39;s your existential destiny</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.990" end="00:44:35.420" style="s2">everything is in harmony and that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.210" end="00:44:48.970" style="s2">the first thing I would say is that if</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.069" end="00:44:50.500" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.970" end="00:44:51.490" style="s2">depressed and they&#39;re really depressed</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.500" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">you should try giving them</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.490" end="00:44:56.859" style="s2">antidepressants because if they die you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:45:00.369" style="s2">can&#39;t help them okay so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.859" end="00:45:03.039" style="s2">suffering you are obligated in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.369" end="00:45:05.289" style="s2">to hold on to whatever rope someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.039" end="00:45:06.760" style="s2">throws you and one of the things I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.289" end="00:45:08.230" style="s2">with my clients all the time especially</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.760" end="00:45:10.029" style="s2">if they&#39;re really in trouble is to tell</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.230" end="00:45:11.770" style="s2">them look I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.029" end="00:45:13.900" style="s2">gonna have helped you but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.770" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">arbitrarily throw out any possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.900" end="00:45:17.980" style="s2">because you might not have that luxury</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.079" end="00:45:19.329" style="s2">antidepressants help a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.980" end="00:45:20.020" style="s2">there are technical reasons why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.329" end="00:45:23.349" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.020" end="00:45:25.089" style="s2">so that&#39;s a simple answer it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.349" end="00:45:27.400" style="s2">relevant to what I already described</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.089" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">except that if you&#39;re offered a gift by</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.400" end="00:45:33.640" style="s2">your society and it works try it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:39.010" style="s2">care what your presuppositions are apart</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.640" end="00:45:40.990" style="s2">from that lots of the lots of time lots</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.010" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">of the time you see people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.990" end="00:45:44.349" style="s2">suffering with depression for example</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:46.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a multitude of reasons but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.349" end="00:45:48.609" style="s2">take one common reason you can think</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.779" end="00:45:51.160" style="s2">about it as associated with the story of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.609" end="00:45:52.990" style="s2">Peter Pan a Peter Pan is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.160" end="00:45:55.210" style="s2">won&#39;t grow up right now the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.990" end="00:45:57.039" style="s2">Peter Pan is he gets to be king but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.210" end="00:45:57.670" style="s2">king of neverland neverland doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.039" end="00:46:00.250" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.670" end="00:46:02.680" style="s2">so being king of nothing isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.250" end="00:46:04.089" style="s2">helpful well one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.680" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">often see with people who suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.089" end="00:46:07.660" style="s2">depression and and I&#39;m not making a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:09.190" style="s2">blanket statement about the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.660" end="00:46:11.500" style="s2">depression because there&#39;s lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.190" end="00:46:12.760" style="s2">is that people who don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.500" end="00:46:15.430" style="s2">order in their life tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.760" end="00:46:17.470" style="s2">overwhelmed so for example if someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.430" end="00:46:19.000" style="s2">comes in to me and sees to see me and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.470" end="00:46:21.390" style="s2">they say they&#39;re depressed I always ask</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.000" end="00:46:25.329" style="s2">them a very standard set of questions I</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.390" end="00:46:26.950" style="s2">do have a job if you don&#39;t have a job</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.329" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">you&#39;re really in trouble in our society</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.950" end="00:46:30.250" style="s2">first of all you your biological rhythms</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:31.420" style="s2">tend to go off the rails right away</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.250" end="00:46:32.680" style="s2">because there&#39;s no reason to go to bed</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.420" end="00:46:34.750" style="s2">at any particular time and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.680" end="00:46:37.270" style="s2">reason to get up and for many people if</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.750" end="00:46:38.980" style="s2">they don&#39;t get up at the same time they</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.270" end="00:46:40.390" style="s2">follow up the functioning of their</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.980" end="00:46:41.559" style="s2">circadian rhythms and that&#39;s enough to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.390" end="00:46:43.089" style="s2">make them depressed right off the bat</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.559" end="00:46:45.220" style="s2">especially if they start napping during</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.089" end="00:46:47.079" style="s2">the afternoon they don&#39;t also don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.220" end="00:46:49.289" style="s2">a purpose people aren&#39;t good without a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.079" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">purpose and this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.289" end="00:46:54.039" style="s2">hypothesizing we absolutely understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:57.069" style="s2">the circuitry that underlies positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.039" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">emotion we know how it works almost all</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.069" end="00:47:00.080" style="s2">the positive emotion that any of you are</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:01.790" style="s2">likely to experience in your life</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.080" end="00:47:04.070" style="s2">will not be a consequence of attaining</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.790" end="00:47:06.290" style="s2">things it will be a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.070" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">seeing that things are working as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.290" end="00:47:10.010" style="s2">proceed towards a goal you value that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:11.300" style="s2">completely different and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.010" end="00:47:13.100" style="s2">know this because people are often</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.300" end="00:47:15.560" style="s2">stunned for example they finish their</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.100" end="00:47:17.030" style="s2">PhD thesis and their presupposition is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.560" end="00:47:19.070" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to be elated for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.030" end="00:47:21.080" style="s2">month and often instead they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.070" end="00:47:22.310" style="s2">depressed and they think what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.080" end="00:47:24.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on this for seven</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.310" end="00:47:26.930" style="s2">years and I handed it in and what do I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.920" end="00:47:28.610" style="s2">do now and that&#39;s what depresses them</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.930" end="00:47:30.140" style="s2">right it&#39;s the what do I do now well</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.610" end="00:47:31.940" style="s2">they&#39;re fine if they enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.140" end="00:47:33.830" style="s2">pursuing the thing as long as it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.940" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2">working out they get a lot of enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.830" end="00:47:36.920" style="s2">and excitement over that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:39.140" style="s2">how our nervous systems work most of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.920" end="00:47:41.210" style="s2">your positive emotion is dual pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.140" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">emotion if you take drugs like cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.210" end="00:47:44.810" style="s2">or amphetamine the reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.130" style="s2">enjoyable is because they turn on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.810" end="00:47:48.140" style="s2">systems that help you pursue goals</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.130" end="00:47:50.150" style="s2">that&#39;s why people like them so if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.140" end="00:47:51.260" style="s2">don&#39;t have a job you got no structure</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.150" end="00:47:54.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.260" end="00:47:56.030" style="s2">plus you tend not to have a point so</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.080" end="00:47:57.110" style="s2">you&#39;re overwhelmed by chaotic lack of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.030" end="00:47:58.490" style="s2">structure and you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.110" end="00:48:00.920" style="s2">positive emotion well you have any</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.700" end="00:48:41.840" style="s2">intimate relationship put together some</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.770" end="00:48:43.520" style="s2">of the foundational items that that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.840" end="00:48:46.580" style="s2">like pillars that your life rests on</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:48.260" style="s2">well that&#39;s the practical thing to do so</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.580" end="00:48:50.890" style="s2">that&#39;s one example with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.260" end="00:48:50.890" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.270" style="s2">well the thing is you don&#39;t just launch</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.560" end="00:48:59.160" style="s2">it on them you know you you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.270" end="00:49:00.630" style="s2">negotiate with the person and you also</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.160" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">got to teach them to negotiate with</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.630" end="00:49:04.830" style="s2">themselves and this is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:06.840" style="s2">very useful to know you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.830" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">Eren eyes yourself into doing things but</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.840" end="00:49:10.080" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t recommend it what I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:11.880" style="s2">recommend instead is that you ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.080" end="00:49:13.320" style="s2">yourself what you&#39;re willing to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.880" end="00:49:15.600" style="s2">a really effective technique it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.320" end="00:49:16.530" style="s2">meditative technique so for example you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.600" end="00:49:18.330" style="s2">can get up in the morning and you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.530" end="00:49:19.950" style="s2">think well you know I&#39;d like to have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.330" end="00:49:21.630" style="s2">good day today so I&#39;d like to go to bed</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.950" end="00:49:23.190" style="s2">tonight without feeling guilty because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.630" end="00:49:24.540" style="s2">you know didn&#39;t do some things I said I</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.190" end="00:49:26.310" style="s2">was gonna do and I you know I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.540" end="00:49:27.870" style="s2">have kind of an interesting day so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.310" end="00:49:29.730" style="s2">got to fulfill my responsibilities and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.870" end="00:49:32.520" style="s2">want to you know enjoy the day then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.730" end="00:49:33.810" style="s2">can ask yourself well okay what would I</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.520" end="00:49:37.170" style="s2">have to do in order for that to happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.810" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">that I would do and the probability if</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.170" end="00:49:39.690" style="s2">you practice this for three or four days</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:40.890" style="s2">is your brain will just tell you it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.690" end="00:49:42.300" style="s2">say well you know there&#39;s that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.890" end="00:49:43.620" style="s2">homework that you haven&#39;t done for like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.300" end="00:49:44.820" style="s2">three weeks you should knock that sucker</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.620" end="00:49:45.930" style="s2">off because it would only take you ten</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.820" end="00:49:47.790" style="s2">minutes and you&#39;ve been avoiding it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.930" end="00:49:50.190" style="s2">torturing yourself to death for you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.790" end="00:49:51.480" style="s2">like like 72 hours straight and if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.190" end="00:49:53.370" style="s2">do that here&#39;s a little interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.480" end="00:49:54.750" style="s2">thing you can do and you know maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.370" end="00:49:57.900" style="s2">is a little obligations you should clean</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.750" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">up and so what what you do in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.900" end="00:50:01.500" style="s2">situation like that is you teach the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:02.970" style="s2">person to negotiate with themself say</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.500" end="00:50:05.070" style="s2">well let&#39;s figure out what your aims are</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.970" end="00:50:06.270" style="s2">you got to have some aims whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.070" end="00:50:07.740" style="s2">are and they might say well I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.270" end="00:50:09.720" style="s2">depressed I don&#39;t have any aims and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.740" end="00:50:11.790" style="s2">I say well pick the least objectionable</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.720" end="00:50:13.260" style="s2">of the aims and act it out for a while</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.790" end="00:50:15.480" style="s2">and see what happens because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.260" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">your emotions your emotional systems are</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.480" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">so fouled up that you have to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:21.570" style="s2">you have to act the thing out before you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:23.100" style="s2">can start to believe it I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.570" end="00:50:25.500" style="s2">always assume they have to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.100" end="00:50:27.540" style="s2">then out but but that&#39;s sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.500" end="00:50:29.250" style="s2">true and lots of times it isn&#39;t so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.540" end="00:50:30.330" style="s2">trick if you&#39;re doing therapeutic work</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.250" end="00:50:31.890" style="s2">with someone and you&#39;re helping them</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.330" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">establish the structure is to find out</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.890" end="00:50:37.470" style="s2">what they&#39;ll do now if they want to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:39.840" style="s2">better which is not a given because</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.470" end="00:50:42.030" style="s2">there are often payoffs for not getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.840" end="00:50:43.890" style="s2">better that&#39;s basically the payoffs of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.030" end="00:50:46.290" style="s2">being a martyr or maybe the payoffs of</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.890" end="00:50:47.790" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re entirely pathological</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.290" end="00:50:50.280" style="s2">family members want you to do because</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.790" end="00:50:51.510" style="s2">they actually want you to fail assuming</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.280" end="00:50:53.790" style="s2">you want to get better there&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.510" end="00:50:55.650" style="s2">something you can figure out that would</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.790" end="00:50:58.830" style="s2">constitute a step towards some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.650" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">concrete goal and my presumption it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.830" end="00:51:04.350" style="s2">behavior of presumptions fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:07.660" style="s2">is that small accruing gains that repeat</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.350" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">are unbelievably powerful so you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.660" end="00:51:10.780" style="s2">this is another thing to know about in</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:12.010" style="s2">your own life it&#39;s something I learned</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.780" end="00:51:13.569" style="s2">in part from reading the writings of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.010" end="00:51:16.359" style="s2">Alexander Solzhenitsyn it was a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.569" end="00:51:17.890" style="s2">Russian philosopher a novelist you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.359" end="00:51:20.410" style="s2">we said you can look at your life and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.890" end="00:51:22.869" style="s2">you can see what isn&#39;t right about it I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.410" end="00:51:24.700" style="s2">mean all you have to do is look and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.869" end="00:51:27.700" style="s2">you can start to fix that and the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.700" end="00:51:30.490" style="s2">you fix it is by noticing what you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.700" end="00:51:31.930" style="s2">in fact fix you know people are often</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.490" end="00:51:33.549" style="s2">trying to fix things they can&#39;t fix</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.930" end="00:51:35.049" style="s2">which I would not recommend because if</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.549" end="00:51:36.940" style="s2">you try to fix something you can&#39;t fix</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.049" end="00:51:38.170" style="s2">you&#39;ll just ruin it like you can find</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.940" end="00:51:40.780" style="s2">all sorts of undergraduates who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.170" end="00:51:42.490" style="s2">perfectly willing to restructure the you</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.780" end="00:51:45.010" style="s2">know the international economic system</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.490" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">who cannot keep their room clean and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.010" end="00:51:48.760" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a gap there you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:51.010" style="s2">which and it&#39;s surprising that people</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.760" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">don&#39;t actually notice so I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.010" end="00:51:54.670" style="s2">you pay attention you can see things</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">that you could fix they yell at you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.670" end="00:51:58.900" style="s2">they really do we even know how that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:00.490" style="s2">happens let me let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.900" end="00:52:03.099" style="s2">example because rooms are full of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.490" end="00:52:04.630" style="s2">stories and the stories have have</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.099" end="00:52:07.329" style="s2">effects on you so here&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.630" end="00:52:08.829" style="s2">experiment so you take two groups</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.329" end="00:52:10.839" style="s2">undergraduates you bring them into your</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.829" end="00:52:13.029" style="s2">lab and you give one group on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.839" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">multiple-choice test that has a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.029" end="00:52:16.420" style="s2">words in it that are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:18.279" style="s2">being old and you give the other group</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.420" end="00:52:19.569" style="s2">the same multiple-choice test except the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.279" end="00:52:21.579" style="s2">words are associated with being young</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.569" end="00:52:22.210" style="s2">this is independent of the content of</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.579" end="00:52:24.910" style="s2">the test</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.210" end="00:52:26.410" style="s2">it&#39;s just descriptions and then you time</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.910" end="00:52:29.140" style="s2">the undergraduates as they walk back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.410" end="00:52:30.579" style="s2">the elevators the ones who read the ones</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.140" end="00:52:31.930" style="s2">who completed the multiple-choice test</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.579" end="00:52:33.819" style="s2">that had more words associated with</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.930" end="00:52:36.099" style="s2">aging walk slower back to the elevators</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.819" end="00:52:37.750" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know that and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.099" end="00:52:39.640" style="s2">know they&#39;re doing it and that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.750" end="00:52:41.740" style="s2">studies been replicated in various forms</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.640" end="00:52:43.180" style="s2">many many times you&#39;re unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.740" end="00:52:44.740" style="s2">sensitive to the story that your</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.180" end="00:52:46.180" style="s2">environments telling you because your</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.740" end="00:52:48.609" style="s2">environment is not made out of objects</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.180" end="00:52:49.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just wrong your environment is</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.609" end="00:52:51.819" style="s2">basically made out of something like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.720" end="00:52:53.559" style="s2">tools and obstacles you&#39;re a tool using</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.819" end="00:52:55.450" style="s2">creature you&#39;re a tool perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.559" end="00:52:56.500" style="s2">creature the things use like if I take</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.450" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">you out of this room and I said well</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.500" end="00:53:00.849" style="s2">what was in the room you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:03.220" style="s2">say you know random patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.849" end="00:53:04.450" style="s2">carpet because they&#39;re they&#39;re real just</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.000" end="00:53:28.060" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve noticed about people</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.590" end="00:53:29.710" style="s2">because I&#39;ve wondered once I started</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.060" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">studying these mythological stories and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.710" end="00:53:36.040" style="s2">I got this idea about the fact that life</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:37.540" style="s2">can be meaningful enough to justify its</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.040" end="00:53:39.580" style="s2">suffering I thought god that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.540" end="00:53:41.470" style="s2">good idea because it&#39;s not optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.580" end="00:53:42.850" style="s2">exactly you know some people tell you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.470" end="00:53:44.920" style="s2">what you can be happy it&#39;s like those</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.850" end="00:53:46.390" style="s2">people are idiots I&#39;m telling you</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.520" end="00:53:51.640" style="s2">you won&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.480" end="00:53:53.530" style="s2">and you&#39;re not happy then and so if life</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.640" end="00:53:56.560" style="s2">is to be happy well in those situations</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.530" end="00:53:58.420" style="s2">what are you doing well I even live but</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.560" end="00:54:00.010" style="s2">light isn&#39;t life isn&#39;t to be happy if</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.010" end="00:54:04.390" style="s2">you should enjoy it you should because</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.750" end="00:54:07.450" style="s2">it&#39;s the grace of God so to speak with</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.390" end="00:54:09.550" style="s2">regards to to meaning I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.450" end="00:54:11.050" style="s2">people know when they&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.550" end="00:54:12.790" style="s2">meaningful they can tell so why the hell</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.050" end="00:54:15.070" style="s2">don&#39;t they do meaningful things all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.790" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">time it seems obvious you could do it I</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.070" end="00:54:18.280" style="s2">mean it&#39;s hard you know because other</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:20.410" style="s2">people want you to do other things and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.280" end="00:54:22.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a struggle but everything&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.410" end="00:54:24.610" style="s2">struggle and then I thought well oh I</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.630" end="00:54:26.170" style="s2">get it I see why it took me about 10</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.610" end="00:54:29.080" style="s2">years to figure this out people have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.170" end="00:54:31.120" style="s2">choice choice number one nothing you do</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.080" end="00:54:33.490" style="s2">means anything well that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.120" end="00:54:35.470" style="s2">drag right meaninglessness of life and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.490" end="00:54:37.600" style="s2">all that existential angst you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.470" end="00:54:39.880" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a pain but the upside of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.600" end="00:54:41.860" style="s2">nothing that you do be mean is</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.880" end="00:54:42.310" style="s2">meaningful is you don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.860" end="00:54:44.140" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.310" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve got no responsibility now you</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.140" end="00:54:46.870" style="s2">have to suffer because things are</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.520" end="00:54:48.940" style="s2">meaningless but that&#39;s a small price to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.870" end="00:54:51.850" style="s2">pay for being able to be completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.940" end="00:54:55.660" style="s2">useless the alternative the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.850" end="00:54:57.790" style="s2">is everything you do matters really if</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.660" end="00:55:00.580" style="s2">you make a mistake it&#39;s a real mistake</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.790" end="00:55:02.530" style="s2">if you betray someone you tilt the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.580" end="00:55:04.900" style="s2">a little more sharply towards evil</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.530" end="00:55:06.940" style="s2">rather than good it matters what you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.900" end="00:55:09.370" style="s2">well if you buy that then you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.940" end="00:55:12.580" style="s2">meaningful life but there&#39;s no mucking</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.370" end="00:55:13.780" style="s2">around it means responsibility it means</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.580" end="00:55:16.030" style="s2">that the decisions you make are</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.780" end="00:55:19.870" style="s2">important it means that when you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.030" end="00:55:22.290" style="s2">something wrong it&#39;s wrong well do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.870" end="00:55:22.290" style="s2">want that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.450" end="00:55:27.330" style="s2">see that&#39;s a very hard question because</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.740" end="00:55:28.620" style="s2">people don&#39;t always mean the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.330" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">when they say their own moral compass</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.620" end="00:55:34.020" style="s2">now so in here here here&#39;s here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:35.580" style="s2">mean by that technically part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.020" end="00:55:36.900" style="s2">the reason that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.580" end="00:55:38.310" style="s2">distinguish between right and wrong is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.900" end="00:55:40.590" style="s2">because you are a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.310" end="00:55:42.900" style="s2">biological organism and then another</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.590" end="00:55:45.240" style="s2">reason is that your head is full of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.900" end="00:55:46.260" style="s2">other people let&#39;s write all the people</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.240" end="00:55:47.580" style="s2">you&#39;ve met all the people that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.260" end="00:55:49.410" style="s2">interacted with they&#39;re all telling you</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.580" end="00:55:52.290" style="s2">a way to behave that&#39;s good in a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.410" end="00:55:54.870" style="s2">that isn&#39;t there are circumstances under</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.290" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">which your conscience should fear the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.870" end="00:55:58.440" style="s2">duty you have to your conscience should</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:03.050" style="s2">override the duty you have to social</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.440" end="00:56:04.890" style="s2">norms but before you break a rule</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.050" end="00:56:06.870" style="s2">because you think you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.890" end="00:56:08.040" style="s2">doing a good thing you bloody well</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.870" end="00:56:10.110" style="s2">better make sure you have your head</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.040" end="00:56:11.820" style="s2">screwed on straight because every time</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.110" end="00:56:15.390" style="s2">you tell yourself a lie and every time</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.820" end="00:56:17.550" style="s2">you act out a falsehood you disturb the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.390" end="00:56:19.890" style="s2">pristine integrity of your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.550" end="00:56:21.060" style="s2">system and the reports it&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.890" end="00:56:23.550" style="s2">about the nature of the world will be</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.060" end="00:56:25.230" style="s2">distorted as a consequence of that so</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.550" end="00:56:26.520" style="s2">yeah you have a moral obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.230" end="00:56:28.830" style="s2">follow the dictates of your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.520" end="00:56:30.510" style="s2">but you also have a moral obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.830" end="00:56:31.800" style="s2">make sure that your life is straight</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.510" end="00:56:33.810" style="s2">enough so that you can rely on your own</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.800" end="00:56:36.080" style="s2">judgment and you can&#39;t separate those</p>
