<p begin="00:00:02.580" end="00:00:05.970" style="s2">to be recording a short introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.110" end="00:00:07.560" style="s2">this episode because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.970" end="00:00:10.050" style="s2">probably the most important episode of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">the portal to date that said under</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.050" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">normal circumstances I probably would</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">have either edited this heavily or not</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">released it at all</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:18.740" style="s2">it starts off quite slow and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">quite awkward before finding its pace</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.740" end="00:00:22.980" style="s2">now what&#39;s going on is that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:26.010" style="s2">interview subject is none other than my</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.980" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">brother Brett Weinstein in Brett&#39;s case</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.010" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">you probably know him if you know him at</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:31.710" style="s2">all as the heroic professor who stood up</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:33.329" style="s2">against what can only be described I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">swear I&#39;m not making this up as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.329" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">Maoist insurrection at an American</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">College in the Pacific Northwest the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:42.750" style="s2">Evergreen State College it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">strange situation because somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.750" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">national media that we would normally</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">have thought would have covered such a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">story for example the media that covered</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:53.129" style="s2">the takeover of straight Hall at Cornell</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:55.620" style="s2">in the 60s that media was almost absent</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.129" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">completely at least they were absent for</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.620" end="00:00:59.670" style="s2">a very long time before they entered</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">late in the game and why is that because</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.670" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">the story ran counter narrative that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">the students at the Evergreen State</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">College who were behaving in a racist</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">fashion were actually students of color</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">and this was an exactly counter</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">narrative story and Bret had it who</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">stood up to this racist insurrection was</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">in fact somebody with a history of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">standing up against racism he had in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">fact been a student at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:26.909" style="s2">Pennsylvania my alma mater an Ivy League</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">school and had had to leave because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.909" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">death threats what he stood up for women</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">of color who were being abused for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">amusement and the sexual amusement of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">white fraternity students so Brett was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">supposed to be familiar to many of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">from that from an old national news</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">story and he was also the hero of a book</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">called the tapers morning bath but</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">somehow the news media who chose not to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">report on the Evergreen story was not</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">very interested either in figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">who Brett was because the stories showed</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">that there was a contradictory problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">with the main narrative in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">that&#39;s quite some sense that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">be recapitulated in this episode there</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">is an official narrative about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">happened in the scientific episode and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">there is a narrative which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">much closer to the truth which I happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.570" style="s2">to be one of a very small number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">witnesses to this alternate story</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.570" end="00:02:18.500" style="s2">now the key question is whether to tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:20.030" style="s2">the story or not and you&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.500" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">that both of us have a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.030" end="00:02:24.050" style="s2">trepidation and energy around the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">question of whether or not to break a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.050" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">long-standing public silence when Brett</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2">found himself as professor in exile</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">along with his wife Heather huiying I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:36.260" style="s2">had thought that the American biology</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">establishment would realize that one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.260" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">their own had been thrown overboard as</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:42.530" style="s2">jetsam and that he would have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:44.870" style="s2">invited to many universities to give</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.530" end="00:02:47.270" style="s2">seminars in biology and it took a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.870" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">for me to understand that because he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.270" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">found at the Evergreen State College the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:54.050" style="s2">people who taught at highly ranked</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:55.910" style="s2">research universities thought that Brett</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.050" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">was something more like a teacher rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.910" end="00:02:59.810" style="s2">than a researcher in fact he had been</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:03.100" style="s2">the top student of one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.810" end="00:03:05.800" style="s2">important evolutionary theorists in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.100" end="00:03:08.780" style="s2">United States Richard Alexander at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.800" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">University of Michigan as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.780" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">student of Bob Trevor&#39;s formerly of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:15.140" style="s2">Harvard arguably one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:19.010" style="s2">living evolutionary theorists I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.140" end="00:03:20.600" style="s2">presently at Rutgers Brett was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.010" end="00:03:23.150" style="s2">who had actually done really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.600" end="00:03:25.640" style="s2">work in his thesis and for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.150" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">the system found it very disturbing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.640" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">consider the full implications of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">work I think in this episode we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">to do something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">I see Brett in two separate ways on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:37.640" style="s2">one hand I view him as a very heroic</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:40.430" style="s2">figure and he&#39;s an absolutely brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.640" end="00:03:42.620" style="s2">person it&#39;s been a pleasure sparring</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.430" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">with him throughout my life however I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.620" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">also his older brother and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.390" end="00:03:50.269" style="s2">hear me it&#39;s sort of my overbearing best</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:52.070" style="s2">browbeating him a bit now the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.269" end="00:03:54.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t to push him down but quite the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.070" end="00:03:56.090" style="s2">contrary I&#39;m rather competitive as</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.410" end="00:03:58.220" style="s2">Brett&#39;s older brother and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.090" end="00:04:00.410" style="s2">to compete with the weakest version of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.220" end="00:04:02.510" style="s2">Brett the professor in exile instead I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.410" end="00:04:04.610" style="s2">want him seated again inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.510" end="00:04:07.489" style="s2">institution where he always belonged and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.610" end="00:04:10.280" style="s2">in order to do that I want him to tell</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.489" end="00:04:11.630" style="s2">the tale not with embellishment but as</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.280" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">it actually happened because I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.630" end="00:04:14.810" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:17.450" style="s2">episodes in modern biology that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.810" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">ever heard so I hope that you like it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.450" end="00:04:21.169" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna put it in front of you as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:22.669" style="s2">experiment and we&#39;re gonna test to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.169" end="00:04:25.039" style="s2">whether or not I&#39;m correct that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.669" end="00:04:25.889" style="s2">portal can be used to augment the usual</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.039" end="00:04:27.629" style="s2">channels</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.889" end="00:04:29.999" style="s2">I believe that a lot of us are sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.629" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">on intellectual gold I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.999" end="00:04:35.069" style="s2">the story that somebody&#39;s work didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.379" style="s2">say the light of day or got attributed</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.069" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">to somebody else is as exotic as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.379" end="00:04:41.189" style="s2">institution&#39;s would have you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:43.469" style="s2">fact I think it&#39;s quite common I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.189" end="00:04:45.509" style="s2">many of us find that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.469" end="00:04:47.249" style="s2">careers inside of science because</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.509" end="00:04:49.590" style="s2">something goes wrong quite early when</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.249" end="00:04:51.629" style="s2">we&#39;re quite vulnerable and my hope is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.590" end="00:04:53.550" style="s2">that some of you listening who I know</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.629" end="00:04:56.069" style="s2">are struggling as graduate students or</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.550" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">as postdocs or as undergraduates will</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.069" end="00:05:00.389" style="s2">listen to this and find some courage to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.240" style="s2">stand up for yourself because quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.389" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">frankly if you choose not to do it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.240" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">order to make nice with your fields the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:09.599" style="s2">chances are you will probably won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">a career in the long term you might as</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.599" end="00:05:13.289" style="s2">well swing for the fences and you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:15.270" style="s2">as well clear your throat and tell your</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.289" end="00:05:17.250" style="s2">story as it actually happened without</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.270" end="00:05:18.930" style="s2">fear I don&#39;t know that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.250" end="00:05:20.729" style="s2">succeed but we&#39;re gonna run an</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.930" end="00:05:22.500" style="s2">experiment and I think both Brett and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.729" end="00:05:24.330" style="s2">are up for it to find out wherever it</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.500" end="00:05:26.939" style="s2">goes the one thing I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.330" end="00:05:29.069" style="s2">if anyone else in the story wants to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.939" end="00:05:31.379" style="s2">tell their version of events it would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.069" end="00:05:33.539" style="s2">an honor to have you on the portal there</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.379" end="00:05:34.949" style="s2">are no bad people in this story in my</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.349" end="00:06:26.099" style="s2">I would imagine a certain fraction of</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.099" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">sort of they randomly call us either</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:35.069" style="s2">which our parents also did while we were</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.000" end="00:06:48.340" style="s2">don&#39;t mind I was trying to think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.310" end="00:06:49.389" style="s2">the fact that we have an opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.389" end="00:06:54.159" style="s2">different because you and I share a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.250" end="00:06:58.659" style="s2">and what I thought is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.159" end="00:07:04.900" style="s2">begin to really focus on areas of your</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.900" end="00:07:08.710" style="s2">than the way in which many people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.460" end="00:07:12.219" style="s2">come to know you so can I ask you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.710" end="00:07:15.069" style="s2">just quickly dispense with in 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.219" end="00:07:18.669" style="s2">how the world has come to recognize you</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.069" end="00:07:20.409" style="s2">if they recognize you at all sure to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.669" end="00:07:24.789" style="s2">extent that I am recognized it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.409" end="00:07:27.310" style="s2">typically as a result of the meltdown at</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.789" end="00:07:28.659" style="s2">Evergreen and my stance its Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.310" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">State called the Evergreen State College</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.659" end="00:07:32.949" style="s2">in Olympia Washington where I taught for</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:36.190" style="s2">14 years along with my wife Heather</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.949" end="00:07:39.990" style="s2">huiying who taught there for 15 years we</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.190" end="00:07:42.969" style="s2">faced a mob of people who accused me of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.990" end="00:07:45.669" style="s2">racism and these were students they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.969" end="00:07:48.159" style="s2">students I had never met and the event</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.669" end="00:07:50.219" style="s2">was so colorful and eventually when the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.159" end="00:07:52.419" style="s2">world caught on to the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.219" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">protesters who became rioters had</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.419" end="00:07:58.210" style="s2">uploaded footage to the net and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:08:01.630" style="s2">whole event could effectively be seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.210" end="00:08:03.909" style="s2">from their perspective it raised</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.630" end="00:08:06.159" style="s2">interest in some other quadrants so for</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.909" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">example I ended up on Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.159" end="00:08:11.349" style="s2">program which was the place I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:13.240" style="s2">most recognized from and you know the my</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.349" end="00:08:16.509" style="s2">first appearance there we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.240" end="00:08:18.580" style="s2">the evergreen situation and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.509" end="00:08:19.719" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the the bulk of how people</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.580" end="00:08:23.050" style="s2">know me all right so you were a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.719" end="00:08:26.169" style="s2">biologist teaching at a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.050" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">obscure college that had previously been</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.169" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">known for social activism and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:34.779" style="s2">love your introduction because when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:38.709" style="s2">say well the students accused me of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.779" end="00:08:40.510" style="s2">racism that leaves sort of a weird</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.709" end="00:08:43.060" style="s2">question like why was he accused of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.510" end="00:08:44.620" style="s2">racism let me solve the puzzle just</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.060" end="00:08:47.079" style="s2">immediately maybe you can&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.620" end="00:08:50.199" style="s2">because that was the closest we&#39;d seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.079" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">to a Maoist takeover inside of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:57.620" style="s2">ever like it was a case of mass insanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.949" end="00:08:59.389" style="s2">and the videos showed it to be mass</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.620" end="00:09:03.139" style="s2">insanity and unless you had been</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.389" end="00:09:05.889" style="s2">indoctrinated to believe that Maoism of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.139" end="00:09:09.379" style="s2">some form Maoist re-education was normal</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.889" end="00:09:11.540" style="s2">the rest of the world said oMG what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.379" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">heck is going on at this completely and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.540" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">say and it wasn&#39;t just like one of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">college craziness pieces this is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:23.689" style="s2">an episode of broad institutional</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:25.459" style="s2">madness that was localized there and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.689" end="00:09:28.309" style="s2">just I want to take it to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.459" end="00:09:30.680" style="s2">self-evident because it is self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.309" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">the video exists and if you took the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.680" end="00:09:36.579" style="s2">people who were trying to pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:40.189" style="s2">you were a racist in their own terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.579" end="00:09:41.990" style="s2">that was sufficient - it was like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.189" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">unreliable narrator they were they were</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.329" end="00:09:52.670" style="s2">of this particular kind of madness well</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a little little more to it in</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.670" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">the sense that they were entirely</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:06.649" style="s2">unprepared for a white guy willing to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:07.879" style="s2">say no I&#39;m simply not a racist and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.649" end="00:10:09.769" style="s2">just didn&#39;t occur to them that that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.879" end="00:10:12.889" style="s2">going to happen and it didn&#39;t occur to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.769" end="00:10:16.129" style="s2">them that my own students weren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.889" end="00:10:17.899" style="s2">to flee to their side at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.129" end="00:10:19.399" style="s2">they leveled their accusation because</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.899" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">those things would have been normal in</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.399" end="00:10:25.610" style="s2">this environment but in my case I grew</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:27.379" style="s2">up in a home there are plenty of flaws</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.610" end="00:10:29.269" style="s2">in that home as you know but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.379" end="00:10:31.610" style="s2">places I don&#39;t think it was flawed was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.269" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">that it was very clear-headed about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.610" end="00:10:41.300" style="s2">issues of inequality race justice and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:43.309" style="s2">I I really have the sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.300" end="00:10:46.329" style="s2">these issues were really not new to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.309" end="00:10:48.740" style="s2">and I had a long history at the college</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.329" end="00:10:50.449" style="s2">lots of students of color you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.740" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">explaining too much I don&#39;t mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.449" end="00:10:57.160" style="s2">rude about it but they were just crazy</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:59.350" style="s2">they were crazy but my point is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.160" end="00:11:02.750" style="s2">accusation is in and of itself so</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.350" end="00:11:05.480" style="s2">powerful in modern circumstances that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.750" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">people the idea of standing</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:13.220" style="s2">the fact is I was not well enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.730" end="00:11:14.810" style="s2">positioned the thing descended into</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.220" end="00:11:17.209" style="s2">madness it descended into literal</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.209" end="00:11:22.339" style="s2">campus the same mob was looking for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.029" end="00:11:24.889" style="s2">searching car-to-car for example was a</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.889" end="00:11:35.060" style="s2">but but what I&#39;m getting at is I checked</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.089" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">with myself and did not feel vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.060" end="00:11:38.149" style="s2">to this accusation I felt most people</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:41.420" style="s2">could not endure it but I was in a</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">had flipped the script and said if you</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.810" end="00:12:31.250" style="s2">I also think that it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.510" end="00:12:34.130" style="s2">to stop giving these people their due</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.250" end="00:12:36.290" style="s2">like it&#39;s really important to exclude</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.010" end="00:12:52.610" style="s2">not to be racist</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.610" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">needs to be thrown in the garbage</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">because it just it&#39;s a suicide idea that</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.010" end="00:13:05.060" style="s2">well you and I are in total agreement</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.420" end="00:13:07.370" style="s2">about the necessity to shut the bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.060" end="00:13:10.699" style="s2">actors rate out of the the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.370" end="00:13:12.589" style="s2">I do have some concern about a large</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.699" end="00:13:14.750" style="s2">number of people who fall into one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.589" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">two camps they&#39;re either confused or</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.750" end="00:13:18.890" style="s2">they suffer from so much cowardice that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:19.350" style="s2">they will sign up for ideas that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.890" end="00:13:21.870" style="s2">ought to know</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:24.840" style="s2">wrong yeah but I think you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.870" end="00:13:29.150" style="s2">getting the message we&#39;ve made a huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.840" end="00:13:31.560" style="s2">mistake and I refuse to spend time</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.150" end="00:13:33.480" style="s2">because these people have decided that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.560" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">this is a tax that we should pay that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.480" end="00:13:38.130" style="s2">they have a serious point it&#39;s a non</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:40.430" style="s2">serious point it&#39;s a terrifying moronic</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.130" end="00:13:43.290" style="s2">non serious point that you can redefine</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.430" end="00:13:45.480" style="s2">racism to be anti racism and anti racism</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.290" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">to be racism nobody knows this better</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.480" end="00:13:54.780" style="s2">than me great okay are we done we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:56.460" style="s2">good with that aside my concern you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.780" end="00:13:58.890" style="s2">that I play this game which is called</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.460" end="00:14:01.200" style="s2">what is the least interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.890" end="00:14:03.330" style="s2">interesting thing about X where I take a</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.350" end="00:14:12.990" style="s2">Dolly Parton is that she&#39;s busty the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.580" end="00:14:15.840" style="s2">most interesting things is she&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.140" end="00:14:22.710" style="s2">point is we get hung up on some stupid</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.850" end="00:14:26.370" style="s2">superficial characteristic and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.710" end="00:14:28.110" style="s2">see the actual interest or Majesty in a</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.790" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">lot of curiosity about what our</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.410" end="00:14:58.020" style="s2">relationship is like and what our</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:00.180" style="s2">discussion sounds like and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.020" end="00:15:02.760" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of memory of that what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.180" end="00:15:04.590" style="s2">like to do is to try to be the foil for</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.760" end="00:15:06.450" style="s2">you that I don&#39;t think anybody else can</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.590" end="00:15:08.280" style="s2">be because I&#39;ve actually I was tracking</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:10.280" style="s2">this story very early and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.280" end="00:15:12.810" style="s2">when I originally tried to get you help</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.280" end="00:15:14.700" style="s2">and allies I think almost the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.810" end="00:15:16.830" style="s2">person who could get what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.700" end="00:15:19.050" style="s2">at Evergreen State was our mutual friend</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.830" end="00:15:21.330" style="s2">sam harris who was willing to amplify</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.050" end="00:15:24.150" style="s2">and retweet this because it was so</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.330" end="00:15:25.800" style="s2">confusing that most of the rest that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.150" end="00:15:27.300" style="s2">we&#39;ll just never seen these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.800" end="00:15:30.270" style="s2">arguments i mean now it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.300" end="00:15:31.800" style="s2">common for people to be aware of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.270" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">problems but when it started happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.800" end="00:15:36.120" style="s2">we didn&#39;t even have any frame</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:39.209" style="s2">for how to think about these yeah and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.120" end="00:15:41.130" style="s2">fact Sam I remember even the content of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.209" end="00:15:44.100" style="s2">his tweet where he entered this</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.130" end="00:15:46.680" style="s2">discussion where he suggested that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:50.430" style="s2">was necessary was ad programming for</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.680" end="00:15:53.850" style="s2">these people and from living inside of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.430" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">this very confusing scenario to hear a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.850" end="00:15:59.010" style="s2">message of reason from the outside that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:16:01.769" style="s2">it was visible how insane this was meant</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.010" end="00:16:03.149" style="s2">a lot to me really it changed things it</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.769" end="00:16:06.510" style="s2">was like a reality check</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.149" end="00:16:08.190" style="s2">Sam is Sam&#39;s a real hero in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.510" end="00:16:10.829" style="s2">it&#39;s just amazing that he got it there</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.190" end="00:16:14.370" style="s2">early and he got there correct and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.829" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">know more power to him yeah okay I as</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.370" end="00:16:21.449" style="s2">you know I was not happy about you being</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:24.570" style="s2">at Evergreen State College long before</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.449" end="00:16:27.899" style="s2">this problem was occurring I viewed you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.570" end="00:16:31.170" style="s2">as sort of retreating into this very</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.899" end="00:16:33.149" style="s2">obscure College and using the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.170" end="00:16:35.750" style="s2">undergraduates as if they were graduate</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.149" end="00:16:39.569" style="s2">students teaching very advanced concepts</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.750" end="00:16:42.360" style="s2">and running kind of a weird Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.569" end="00:16:46.050" style="s2">style program with very adventurous</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.360" end="00:16:49.800" style="s2">material with no recognition that this</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.050" end="00:16:53.339" style="s2">kind of unusual educational environment</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.800" end="00:16:56.610" style="s2">was even occurring fair unfair well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.339" end="00:16:59.339" style="s2">mostly fair it was not really an</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.610" end="00:17:01.829" style="s2">appropriate place I don&#39;t regret it I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.339" end="00:17:04.169" style="s2">think for the last year or two Heather</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.829" end="00:17:05.819" style="s2">and I were living on borrowed time if</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.169" end="00:17:10.140" style="s2">this could have come for us in a worse</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.819" end="00:17:15.209" style="s2">way and it could have come for us at any</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.140" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">moment but the the thing about the job I</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.209" end="00:17:21.569" style="s2">had was that it was the upside of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.819" style="s2">crazy experiment in education the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.569" end="00:17:26.309" style="s2">founders of the college had broken every</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.819" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">rule of a Normal University and half of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.309" end="00:17:30.150" style="s2">what they did in breaking it was crazy</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:33.090" style="s2">and half of what they did was brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.150" end="00:17:35.910" style="s2">nobody ever bothered to separate the two</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.090" end="00:17:39.690" style="s2">from the prototype and you know fixed</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.910" end="00:17:41.370" style="s2">the broken part didn&#39;t happen but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.690" end="00:17:43.020" style="s2">administrators had no power and very</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.370" end="00:17:45.179" style="s2">little knowledge about what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.020" end="00:17:47.480" style="s2">in the classroom which meant that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.179" end="00:17:50.600" style="s2">could create a learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:52.820" style="s2">environment that worked both from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.600" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">point of view of students and worked</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.820" end="00:17:57.559" style="s2">from the point of view of me in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:17:59.540" style="s2">objectives to keep advancing a research</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.559" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">program that frankly I would have had no</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.540" end="00:18:04.820" style="s2">way to keep on at a normal college I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.750" end="00:18:06.200" style="s2">would have been so burdened by teaching</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.820" end="00:18:10.100" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t have combined the two</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.200" end="00:18:11.390" style="s2">things so anyway I do think one has to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.100" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">figure out how to make their way in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.390" end="00:18:14.450" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:16.100" style="s2">financially one has to figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.450" end="00:18:18.530" style="s2">to raise their kids and from many</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.100" end="00:18:20.870" style="s2">perspectives as much of a mismatch as</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.530" end="00:18:23.960" style="s2">evergreen was for me in some ways in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.870" end="00:18:26.290" style="s2">some other ways it was not a bad place</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.960" end="00:18:30.049" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.290" end="00:18:31.340" style="s2">part it gave me I was anonymous from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.049" end="00:18:35.270" style="s2">point of the world and I could make</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.340" end="00:18:39.890" style="s2">progress on biology so I have fewer</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.270" end="00:18:42.290" style="s2">regrets than I might okay this is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.890" end="00:18:45.620" style="s2">uncomfortable but it is also the real</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.290" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">substance of our relationship I always</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.620" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">resented the fact that you really</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">excelled at and enjoyed teaching as much</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">as you did and you saw this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:01.460" style="s2">a place to play with ideas to teach</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:04.610" style="s2">students to have a pleasant and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.460" end="00:19:07.040" style="s2">enjoyable life healthy as it was in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.040" end="00:19:11.870" style="s2">and I still see these characteristics it</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.280" end="00:19:14.390" style="s2">you what it drives me nuts because</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.870" end="00:19:18.770" style="s2">you&#39;re your own worst enemy in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.390" end="00:19:21.169" style="s2">to me what you really are to me is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.770" end="00:19:25.309" style="s2">unbelievable thinker and researcher and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.169" end="00:19:30.440" style="s2">beneath this kind of very nice friendly</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.309" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">pedagogue is a thinker that the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.440" end="00:19:36.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know and I watched recently your</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.710" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">interactions with Richard Dawkins and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.950" end="00:19:42.890" style="s2">was absolutely infuriating I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:45.620" style="s2">very clear saying well Brett is a real</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:47.720" style="s2">hero so far as free speech and standing</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.620" end="00:19:50.630" style="s2">up for free inquiry goes but he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.720" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">confused well no I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.630" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">that&#39;s right I think that you guys had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:56.510" style="s2">really substantive interaction about</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:19:58.460" style="s2">biology which I wish he would spend more</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.510" end="00:20:00.039" style="s2">time on because he&#39;s phenomenal at it</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.460" end="00:20:02.049" style="s2">when he&#39;s focused on it</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.039" end="00:20:03.549" style="s2">and you&#39;re phenomenal and that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.049" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">supposed to be a really different</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.549" end="00:20:08.649" style="s2">conversation but because we got to know</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:10.659" style="s2">you the wrong way in my opinion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.649" end="00:20:13.869" style="s2">always the guy who is strong enough to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.659" end="00:20:16.869" style="s2">stand up to students at an obscure place</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.869" end="00:20:19.479" style="s2">and this completely masks who you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.869" end="00:20:21.700" style="s2">always been and you&#39;re not willing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.479" end="00:20:24.100" style="s2">take up the yoke which is the more</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.700" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">important role for you well I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.100" end="00:20:28.539" style="s2">that I&#39;m not willing I think you and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:30.489" style="s2">have a different approach to this and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.539" end="00:20:33.159" style="s2">may be you know birth order stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.489" end="00:20:35.979" style="s2">whatever but you know and I also I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.159" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">the benefit of you in the world doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.979" end="00:20:41.889" style="s2">what you do which I do wonder sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:45.820" style="s2">what would have happened to me at</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.889" end="00:20:48.009" style="s2">Evergreen had I only had my own tools at</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.820" end="00:20:50.769" style="s2">my disposal it&#39;s quite possible I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.009" end="00:20:54.039" style="s2">have been effectively snuffed out in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.769" end="00:20:56.830" style="s2">private and I don&#39;t know what I would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.039" end="00:20:59.169" style="s2">doing at the moment as it happens the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.830" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">evergreen story turned into rocket fuel</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.169" end="00:21:04.179" style="s2">that propelled me into a strata where</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:05.950" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of interesting things to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.179" end="00:21:08.649" style="s2">that may not be exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.950" end="00:21:10.690" style="s2">talking about but they they make sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.649" end="00:21:12.789" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.690" end="00:21:14.379" style="s2">I&#39;m trying yeah I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.789" end="00:21:16.450" style="s2">understand what it is that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.379" end="00:21:17.619" style="s2">do here I believe that your</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.450" end="00:21:21.639" style="s2">miscategorized</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.619" end="00:21:25.119" style="s2">and you&#39;re really not grasping that this</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.639" end="00:21:27.809" style="s2">is my opportunity no I am I am grasping</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.119" end="00:21:32.649" style="s2">what what I think distinguishes us is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.809" end="00:21:35.799" style="s2">that we have very different styles with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.649" end="00:21:40.479" style="s2">respect to approaching things I for</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.799" end="00:21:45.700" style="s2">example take a certain perverse pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.479" end="00:21:48.029" style="s2">in watching Dawkins slowly move in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.700" end="00:21:50.739" style="s2">direction which I believe is happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.029" end="00:21:52.119" style="s2">now I would like him to move faster he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.739" end="00:21:53.769" style="s2">not a young man and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.119" end="00:21:55.659" style="s2">actually quite important that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.769" end="00:21:58.840" style="s2">recognized where the errors in his own</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.659" end="00:22:01.330" style="s2">thinking are and to be honest I believe</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.840" end="00:22:04.179" style="s2">I know where at least several major ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.330" end="00:22:06.129" style="s2">live and I know what he would see if he</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.179" end="00:22:08.200" style="s2">could be brought to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.129" end="00:22:10.509" style="s2">nature of those errors and to confront</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:12.129" style="s2">the frankly the portal that opens if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.509" end="00:22:13.210" style="s2">walk through a slightly different door</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.129" end="00:22:17.470" style="s2">than he&#39;s been walking through</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.210" end="00:22:20.370" style="s2">but you know it didn&#39;t work in one</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.470" end="00:22:25.930" style="s2">evening I always wondered if it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.370" end="00:22:29.020" style="s2">but there is still the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.930" end="00:22:31.090" style="s2">he will have the Epiphany that I hope he</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.020" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">will have I I really don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.090" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">even where we are in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:39.220" style="s2">ok ok you&#39;re not getting it you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">found at Evergreen State College that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.220" end="00:22:45.040" style="s2">a communication to the world that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:49.060" style="s2">weren&#39;t very good and every time I try</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.040" end="00:22:52.360" style="s2">to say this is completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.060" end="00:22:54.490" style="s2">you miss you don&#39;t catch the ball that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.360" end="00:22:55.960" style="s2">being thrown to you which is you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.490" end="00:22:58.570" style="s2">understanding what you&#39;re up against he</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.960" end="00:23:00.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take you seriously because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.570" end="00:23:02.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have a list of publications that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.490" end="00:23:04.600" style="s2">speaks to who it is that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.860" end="00:23:07.720" style="s2">are or what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.600" end="00:23:09.910" style="s2">or where you&#39;ve been and as a result you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.720" end="00:23:12.070" style="s2">continue to be the good guy who&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.910" end="00:23:14.200" style="s2">well-spoken very thoughtful it says very</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.070" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">interesting things and constantly gives</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.200" end="00:23:21.180" style="s2">away power to other people mmm I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">think so there&#39;s a question about how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.180" end="00:23:27.000" style="s2">confront the opportunities that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.440" end="00:23:32.890" style="s2">got the hand you&#39;ve been dealt and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.000" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">think you and I share a certain delight</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.890" end="00:23:37.780" style="s2">when we do our homework and we discover</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.750" style="s2">something interesting and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.780" end="00:23:42.550" style="s2">nobody else gets it hmm that would feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.750" end="00:23:43.900" style="s2">bad to most people because they would</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.550" end="00:23:46.120" style="s2">feel like what am I doing wrong why does</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.900" end="00:23:50.410" style="s2">nobody else understand this point to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.120" end="00:23:53.470" style="s2">and me that feels good it is to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.410" end="00:23:56.020" style="s2">that you have achieved something you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:57.880" style="s2">have discovered something and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.020" end="00:23:59.710" style="s2">nobody else can even recognize it gives</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.880" end="00:24:02.830" style="s2">you some sort of sense of how far ahead</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.710" end="00:24:06.370" style="s2">you might be the question is what to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.830" end="00:24:12.790" style="s2">with those things and there I think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.370" end="00:24:17.770" style="s2">question is if I went through something</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.790" end="00:24:23.110" style="s2">with I said something intemperate to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.770" end="00:24:26.050" style="s2">New Atheists and suddenly Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.110" end="00:24:33.350" style="s2">Jerry Coyne</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.050" end="00:24:36.650" style="s2">Michael Shermer Richard Dawkins and Neil</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.350" end="00:24:38.630" style="s2">Shubin came at me all at once not on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.650" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">topic that I had caused a fence on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.630" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">totally different topic they had picked</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:46.100" style="s2">something off my youtube channel Jerry</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:48.200" style="s2">Coyne had claimed to have debunked it he</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.100" end="00:24:51.470" style="s2">was wrong but nonetheless it provided</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.200" end="00:24:56.540" style="s2">fodder for them to attack their point</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:59.510" style="s2">was that I didn&#39;t understand natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.540" end="00:25:00.860" style="s2">selection and that to the extent I might</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.510" end="00:25:02.930" style="s2">believe I knew something that other</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.860" end="00:25:05.690" style="s2">people didn&#39;t know the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.930" end="00:25:08.840" style="s2">was to submit it to a journal and go</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.690" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">through peer review I pointed out to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.840" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">them that peer review was not Richard</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:15.980" style="s2">Dawkins style and that he in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.440" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">advanced the ball for the field</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.980" end="00:25:23.180" style="s2">substantially but has barely published a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:27.020" style="s2">paper that backed them off that course</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.180" end="00:25:28.580" style="s2">and their tune changed too well how</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.020" end="00:25:32.390" style="s2">about a book then that&#39;s what Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.580" end="00:25:35.060" style="s2">did and to me that&#39;s a win the idea I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.390" end="00:25:38.570" style="s2">not against peer review I want peers to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.060" end="00:25:41.480" style="s2">review my work but I don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.570" end="00:25:44.600" style="s2">snuffed out in private and so to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.480" end="00:25:47.180" style="s2">extent that that little battle was a the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.600" end="00:25:48.890" style="s2">result of them under estimating me and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.180" end="00:25:50.990" style="s2">not knowing that something was going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.890" end="00:25:52.670" style="s2">come back that was cogent and responsive</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.990" end="00:25:54.980" style="s2">to the world as it actually is and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.670" end="00:25:56.660" style="s2">having them back off their position and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.980" end="00:26:00.050" style="s2">say yes actually a book would be a fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.660" end="00:26:02.540" style="s2">thing that was positive movement from my</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.050" end="00:26:06.830" style="s2">perspective they underestimated me and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.540" end="00:26:09.320" style="s2">they had to back down so I can&#39;t regret</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:10.790" style="s2">that too much to me on a different time</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.320" end="00:26:12.830" style="s2">scale I believe I&#39;m making progress</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.790" end="00:26:15.290" style="s2">toward a goal that you and I agree is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.830" end="00:26:17.540" style="s2">the right one but I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.290" end="00:26:21.740" style="s2">coming at it guns blazing is the way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.540" end="00:26:24.500" style="s2">go well I&#39;m happy to stop the interview</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.740" end="00:26:27.280" style="s2">right here and right now because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:30.950" style="s2">adorable and it&#39;s sweet and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.280" end="00:26:33.860" style="s2">incredibly patient and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.950" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">beautiful sentiment but I also feel like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.860" end="00:26:38.520" style="s2">I sat through all of the wars and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">battles to get your ideas into the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.520" end="00:26:45.270" style="s2">and I&#39;m not funding that program does it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:47.790" style="s2">sound to you like I&#39;m surrendering no it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.270" end="00:26:50.160" style="s2">sounds to me like you&#39;re boring me like</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.370" end="00:31:42.570" style="s2">was almost always respectful silence</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.830" end="00:32:38.270" style="s2">years did I tell you you got to get out</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.330" end="00:32:42.179" style="s2">of that place well look first of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.270" end="00:32:45.540" style="s2">dick was very clear with me about the</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.150" end="00:37:05.530" style="s2">may be right okay I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.140" end="00:37:09.069" style="s2">the subjects that you&#39;re most associated</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.530" end="00:37:11.560" style="s2">with starting with your thesis and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.069" end="00:37:13.270" style="s2">want to get into the science of it using</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.270" end="00:37:19.420" style="s2">behind they get left behind okay okay</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.420" end="00:37:24.730" style="s2">evolutionary theory because it it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.420" end="00:37:27.400" style="s2">hard to use evolutionary theory to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.730" end="00:37:30.010" style="s2">predictions that can be verified in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.400" end="00:37:32.829" style="s2">world it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of like this loose</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.010" end="00:37:34.420" style="s2">amorphous collection of techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.829" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">viewpoints and people sometimes think</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.420" end="00:37:38.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not even a theory because it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:40.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be predictive and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.230" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">there are a few predictions so am i</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.180" end="00:37:43.869" style="s2">right Darwin started this game off by</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:45.700" style="s2">predicting that there would be a moth</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.869" end="00:37:47.410" style="s2">with a really long tongue</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.700" end="00:37:50.080" style="s2">because there was a flower that had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.410" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">really long distance to go before you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.080" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">could get the nectar out of ya he had</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2">been sent an orchid by Bateson maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:38:02.350" style="s2">with a foot long corolla tube and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.500" end="00:38:03.820" style="s2">reasoned very straightforwardly that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.350" end="00:38:05.260" style="s2">would make no sense for this plant to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.820" end="00:38:06.970" style="s2">have invested in this very long</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.260" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">structure if there were not a tongue</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.970" end="00:38:11.590" style="s2">that could reach down to gather the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:13.660" style="s2">nectar and I believe he did not live to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.590" end="00:38:16.450" style="s2">see the discovery of that animal I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.660" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">know that but he he was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.450" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">correct there is a moth that has this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:22.840" style="s2">beautifully long tongue it&#39;s a spin Jude</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:27.070" style="s2">hawk moth one of these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.840" end="00:38:29.500" style="s2">hummingbird esque moths and anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.070" end="00:38:31.090" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the major predictions</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.500" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">demonstrations that evolution color</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.090" end="00:38:35.590" style="s2">theory actually can be used to predict</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:38.650" style="s2">phenomena that you haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.590" end="00:38:41.080" style="s2">observe okay and you know Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.650" end="00:38:43.750" style="s2">famously couldn&#39;t for example like I</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.080" end="00:38:46.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know how much I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.750" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">this in the open but my favorite Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.300" end="00:38:50.440" style="s2">book is the one he wrote after Origin of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:51.820" style="s2">Species which is on the various</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.440" end="00:38:53.170" style="s2">contrivances by which British and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.820" end="00:38:55.690" style="s2">foreign orchids are fertilized by</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.170" end="00:38:57.250" style="s2">insects it makes absolutely no sense is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.690" end="00:38:59.170" style="s2">it title because I think that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.250" end="00:39:01.000" style="s2">so funny about it and but because</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.170" end="00:39:02.710" style="s2">orchids are so highly speciated turned</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.000" end="00:39:05.350" style="s2">out to be the perfect place to explore</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.710" end="00:39:07.540" style="s2">the consequences of evolution and he</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.350" end="00:39:10.870" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure out my favorite I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.540" end="00:39:11.380" style="s2">whether it&#39;s clade or group it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.870" end="00:39:14.590" style="s2">safe</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.380" end="00:39:16.390" style="s2">yeah clade of orchids the ophrys system</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.590" end="00:39:19.750" style="s2">which is just unbelievable because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.390" end="00:39:22.090" style="s2">mimics the pollinators the female of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.750" end="00:39:25.150" style="s2">pollinator species using pheromone</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.090" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">pheromones and some sort of replica good</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.150" end="00:39:29.110" style="s2">enough to fool males into copulating</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:32.410" style="s2">with the lower petal of an orchid it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.110" end="00:39:35.170" style="s2">sturdy replica of the female yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.410" end="00:39:37.120" style="s2">smells like her and it just so happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.170" end="00:39:40.180" style="s2">that when the male lands on it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.120" end="00:39:43.270" style="s2">copulate he gets these pollen packets</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.180" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">glued to him and then he screws up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.270" end="00:39:47.140" style="s2">makes the same mistake at another flower</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:48.670" style="s2">and he may he may or may not put it this</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:51.070" style="s2">but only the ones that screw up twice</p>

<p begin="00:39:51.070" end="00:39:54.940" style="s2">it gets glued to him is that it has</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.900" end="00:39:57.130" style="s2">worked enough times for this strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.940" end="00:39:59.230" style="s2">have been so beautifully refined right</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.130" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">so Darwin saw that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.230" end="00:40:02.619" style="s2">there was this mimicry going RB couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:04.990" style="s2">put it together you split the pages and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.619" end="00:40:06.850" style="s2">pages not getting it so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.990" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">very funny so he predicts some things</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.850" end="00:40:12.250" style="s2">but he can&#39;t predict something else in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:14.680" style="s2">very closely related system okay fast</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.250" end="00:40:16.660" style="s2">forward Dick Alexander comes out with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.680" end="00:40:18.580" style="s2">crazy prediction which I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.660" end="00:40:21.369" style="s2">fully I mean it&#39;s just amazing that he</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.580" end="00:40:23.770" style="s2">made it where he says I bet that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.369" end="00:40:26.830" style="s2">will find the kind of behavior we</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.770" end="00:40:28.660" style="s2">associate with wasps and bees which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.830" end="00:40:33.820" style="s2">in this clay called hymenopteran dance</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.660" end="00:40:36.430" style="s2">of you social breeding patterns in an</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.820" end="00:40:40.210" style="s2">organization but in mammals that will</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.430" end="00:40:41.950" style="s2">live underground so I think the way this</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.210" end="00:40:44.410" style="s2">story actually worked he didn&#39;t say you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.950" end="00:40:46.570" style="s2">will find or you could find what he said</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.410" end="00:40:50.530" style="s2">is in principle there&#39;s no reason that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.570" end="00:40:52.750" style="s2">you social animal has to be an insect</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.530" end="00:40:55.450" style="s2">that in fact you could get such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.750" end="00:40:57.460" style="s2">in a mammal and then he predicted I</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.450" end="00:41:00.369" style="s2">forget how many characteristics there</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.460" end="00:41:02.650" style="s2">were but he named some there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.369" end="00:41:05.470" style="s2">funny about the system of ants bees</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.650" end="00:41:07.960" style="s2">wasps which is that they&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.470" end="00:41:09.880" style="s2">very strange haplotype loyd chromosomal</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.960" end="00:41:11.080" style="s2">characteristic do you want to say a word</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.880" end="00:41:14.380" style="s2">about that because that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.080" end="00:41:17.350" style="s2">prediction more sure so it has long been</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.380" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">understood that the Hymenoptera behaved</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.350" end="00:41:22.060" style="s2">in this incredibly cooperative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:24.250" style="s2">in which effectively all of the workers</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.060" end="00:41:25.930" style="s2">of the colony forego reproduction in</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.480" end="00:41:35.890" style="s2">discovered that actually their genetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.550" end="00:41:39.940" style="s2">system is unlike our genetic system and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.890" end="00:41:41.350" style="s2">that males have basically half a full</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.940" end="00:41:43.270" style="s2">complement of genes they have enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.350" end="00:41:46.300" style="s2">genes to function but they have half the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.270" end="00:41:48.340" style="s2">female complement of genes and for</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.300" end="00:41:51.090" style="s2">reasons that are mathematically slightly</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.340" end="00:41:55.980" style="s2">complicated and require a chalkboard the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.090" end="00:41:59.109" style="s2">females are more closely related to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.980" end="00:42:00.730" style="s2">daughters produced by their mother than</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.109" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">they would be to their own offspring</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.730" end="00:42:04.060" style="s2">they&#39;re three-quarters relatives to her</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:08.619" style="s2">offspring in there they would be 50%</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.060" end="00:42:11.800" style="s2">relatives to their own house so they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.619" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">actually evolutionarily favored by very</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.800" end="00:42:14.380" style="s2">standard</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:16.119" style="s2">mechanisms once you understand the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.380" end="00:42:18.549" style="s2">genetics underlying the thing they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.119" end="00:42:20.769" style="s2">favored to engage in behavior where they</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.549" end="00:42:22.930" style="s2">forego reproducing and once you</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.769" end="00:42:25.990" style="s2">understand the chromosomal difference of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.930" end="00:42:28.059" style="s2">this system it is far less surprising</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.990" end="00:42:31.359" style="s2">that it would behave as a loosely</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.059" end="00:42:34.660" style="s2">coupled in some way don&#39;t over don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:36.339" style="s2">overreact Hut unified organism which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.660" end="00:42:37.869" style="s2">distributed that there is a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.339" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">and there are ways in which the hive</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.869" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">behaves as a super organism and there</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:44.230" style="s2">are ways in which it does not</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:46.900" style="s2">yeah well all I want to say is I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.230" end="00:42:48.700" style="s2">sure how clear we have the story with</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.900" end="00:42:51.190" style="s2">respect to what precedes what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.700" end="00:42:53.049" style="s2">completely plausible that the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.190" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">precedes the evolution of the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.049" end="00:42:56.559" style="s2">system right and I actually frankly just</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:42:58.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know where that research stands at</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.559" end="00:43:01.269" style="s2">the moment we have found many other</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.660" end="00:43:03.700" style="s2">insect systems that have various</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.269" end="00:43:06.279" style="s2">versions of this interestingly though</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.700" end="00:43:07.900" style="s2">the termites are not hymenopteran right</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.279" end="00:43:09.700" style="s2">and the termites engage in this behavior</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.900" end="00:43:11.230" style="s2">and they rights are you social but</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.700" end="00:43:13.900" style="s2">they&#39;re not a political they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.230" end="00:43:16.390" style="s2">socially behave very much like ants okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.900" end="00:43:18.700" style="s2">but they don&#39;t have the strange genetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.390" end="00:43:20.170" style="s2">system proving that the the behavior can</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.700" end="00:43:21.460" style="s2">involve even in the absence of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.170" end="00:43:22.869" style="s2">genetic system well the reason I bring</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.460" end="00:43:24.759" style="s2">this up is that if you if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.869" end="00:43:27.670" style="s2">for example Prince Peter Kropotkin the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.759" end="00:43:30.279" style="s2">great anarchist theorist he was obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.670" end="00:43:33.369" style="s2">by finding analogues in nature of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.279" end="00:43:34.660" style="s2">preferred human structures and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.369" end="00:43:36.609" style="s2">very simple to say why can&#39;t we work</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.660" end="00:43:38.829" style="s2">together the way an ant colony all works</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.609" end="00:43:40.059" style="s2">together and then there&#39;s a counter to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.829" end="00:43:42.130" style="s2">that which is well they have different</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.059" end="00:43:44.289" style="s2">chromosomal structures and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.130" end="00:43:46.299" style="s2">well but yes but that&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.289" end="00:43:48.670" style="s2">cheap way of achieving eusociality there</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.299" end="00:43:53.259" style="s2">are other ways of it so we threw this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.670" end="00:43:55.630" style="s2">crazy kind of investigation we get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.259" end="00:43:58.359" style="s2">Dick Alexander who and I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.630" end="00:44:00.700" style="s2">quite quite correct says there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.359" end="00:44:04.619" style="s2">nothing prohibiting us from finding a</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.700" end="00:44:09.700" style="s2">mammalian species that exhibits ant and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.619" end="00:44:10.869" style="s2">wasp like behavior and it would have it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.700" end="00:44:12.569" style="s2">would be likely to have these</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.869" end="00:44:16.299" style="s2">characteristics it would live</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.569" end="00:44:18.579" style="s2">underground and uh yeah underground</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.299" end="00:44:21.190" style="s2">I believe eating tubers was was ah it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.579" end="00:44:23.049" style="s2">was a crazy list raising and you know my</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.190" end="00:44:24.369" style="s2">understanding from from dick dick is now</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.049" end="00:44:26.360" style="s2">unfortunately dead he died a couple</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.369" end="00:44:28.890" style="s2">years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.360" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">my understanding from him was that he</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:33.870" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually expect to find such an</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:35.610" style="s2">animal he was speaking very absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.870" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">just completely theoretically and at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.610" end="00:44:39.540" style="s2">point that he unleashed this idea it may</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">even have been in a talk rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.540" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">paper the information made it back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:49.260" style="s2">him actually what about naked mole-rats</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:52.320" style="s2">they match your characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.260" end="00:44:54.780" style="s2">study reveals then that actually they</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.320" end="00:44:57.590" style="s2">are you social they behave very much</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.780" end="00:44:59.970" style="s2">like ants bees wasps termites etc and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.590" end="00:45:03.240" style="s2">just like one of the great moments in</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.970" end="00:45:04.740" style="s2">modern science I really think it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.240" end="00:45:08.120" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly the moment that people</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.740" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">who know who Dick Alexander was</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.120" end="00:45:12.990" style="s2">reference as sort of the high-water mark</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:14.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s comprehensible you</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.990" end="00:45:15.900" style="s2">know did a lot of things he was very</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.460" end="00:45:18.860" style="s2">interested in people and other things</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.900" end="00:45:22.080" style="s2">but this particular demonstration was so</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.860" end="00:45:24.300" style="s2">it would be impossible to have predicted</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.080" end="00:45:26.310" style="s2">such a thing and have gotten lucky he</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.300" end="00:45:28.230" style="s2">had to have understood some things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.310" end="00:45:30.120" style="s2">were extremely deep in order for that to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.230" end="00:45:33.810" style="s2">have worked out and so yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.120" end="00:45:35.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know of another example in in in</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.810" end="00:45:39.390" style="s2">evolutionary theory of a prediction that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.940" end="00:45:46.680" style="s2">clean of something that obscure I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.390" end="00:45:52.410" style="s2">one oh yeah yeah I once heard a story</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.680" end="00:45:56.660" style="s2">about a a graduate student who predicted</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.410" end="00:46:01.500" style="s2">that the breeding protocols of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.660" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">laboratory rodents would compromise the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.500" end="00:46:07.380" style="s2">laboratory system in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:10.080" style="s2">relationship to so-called wild-type</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.380" end="00:46:15.750" style="s2">versions of the same species so you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.080" end="00:46:17.250" style="s2">the bred rodents and you have the wild</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.750" end="00:46:20.370" style="s2">rodents and that they would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.250" end="00:46:24.930" style="s2">distinguished by virtue of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.370" end="00:46:26.430" style="s2">the non-coding nucleotide sequence at</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.930" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">the end of the chromosome known as</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.430" end="00:46:29.730" style="s2">telomeres would be wildly different in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:32.040" style="s2">length</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.730" end="00:46:37.130" style="s2">if the prediction were true from pure</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.040" end="00:46:39.290" style="s2">evolutionary theory Wow yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.130" end="00:46:41.270" style="s2">yeah that story it didn&#39;t happen exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.290" end="00:46:44.090" style="s2">the way you said it but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.270" end="00:46:45.500" style="s2">been a lot of years and take well</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.090" end="00:46:47.930" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get back there yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.500" end="00:46:52.310" style="s2">it&#39;s you you did that yeah I did that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.930" end="00:46:55.670" style="s2">and that story unfortunately has not</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:46:58.820" style="s2">really been told and it is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.670" end="00:47:00.500" style="s2">your central origin story as a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.820" end="00:47:02.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty good one and it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.500" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">changed the way I saw myself in a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.630" end="00:47:09.320" style="s2">that has been very productive okay I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:11.590" style="s2">want you to talk to me about that story</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.320" end="00:47:16.510" style="s2">and I will because I lived it with you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.590" end="00:47:19.640" style="s2">um I know that it happened and I know</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.510" end="00:47:21.470" style="s2">that it got buried and I know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.640" end="00:47:24.020" style="s2">part of what I&#39;m calling the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.470" end="00:47:25.910" style="s2">idea suppression complex because quite</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.020" end="00:47:27.890" style="s2">frankly you were not the only person who</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.910" end="00:47:30.050" style="s2">was a part of the story and the story</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.890" end="00:47:32.660" style="s2">had to die because it said something</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.050" end="00:47:34.550" style="s2">which is that the power of your theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.660" end="00:47:40.120" style="s2">was sufficient to predict from first</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.550" end="00:47:44.600" style="s2">principles a manifestly observed and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.120" end="00:47:47.530" style="s2">surprising result with in molecular</p>

<p begin="00:47:47.530" end="00:47:53.660" style="s2">yep all right I&#39;ll try to do a short</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.510" end="00:47:57.170" style="s2">version of it you know this is long-form</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.660" end="00:47:59.240" style="s2">podcasting and you tell however long the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.170" end="00:48:02.330" style="s2">story is I guarantee you when people</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.240" end="00:48:05.330" style="s2">finally figure out that it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.330" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">the rodents that we&#39;ve used to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.330" end="00:48:10.900" style="s2">drugs on let&#39;s say might be compromised</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:15.610" style="s2">and compromised in a way that would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.900" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">potentially extra permitting of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.610" end="00:48:20.660" style="s2">potential toxins in the form of</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.660" end="00:48:22.580" style="s2">to be fascinating it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.890" end="00:48:24.200" style="s2">repaid</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.580" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s going to repay the study that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.200" end="00:48:30.560" style="s2">will take to understand the story the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:33.140" style="s2">floor is yours alright so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.560" end="00:48:35.720" style="s2">set the stage a little bit evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.140" end="00:48:39.020" style="s2">biology whoo but do me a favor yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.720" end="00:48:42.770" style="s2">you can get into a very patient careful</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.020" end="00:48:45.350" style="s2">pedagogical mode this is an exciting</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.770" end="00:48:46.430" style="s2">story tell it the way it actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.350" end="00:48:49.220" style="s2">going to tell it the way it actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.430" end="00:48:51.690" style="s2">occurred and I&#39;m gonna be careful I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.220" end="00:48:54.249" style="s2">gonna try not to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.690" end="00:48:55.869" style="s2">there are parts of it that were for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.249" end="00:48:58.299" style="s2">very long time kind of emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.869" end="00:49:02.650" style="s2">fraught but anyway I think I think I</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.299" end="00:49:04.769" style="s2">remember it well enough to do a sparse</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.650" end="00:49:07.569" style="s2">but complete version okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.769" end="00:49:12.420" style="s2">evolutionary biology has long been</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.569" end="00:49:15.730" style="s2">biased in the direction of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.420" end="00:49:17.230" style="s2">rather than thinking about mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.730" end="00:49:19.380" style="s2">that is to say we deal in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.230" end="00:49:21.910" style="s2">phenomenology of things we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.380" end="00:49:23.529" style="s2">gross patterns that we see in nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.910" end="00:49:26.049" style="s2">rather than talking about the fine</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.529" end="00:49:27.999" style="s2">detail of what drives them that has been</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.049" end="00:49:30.039" style="s2">changing in recent decades but it has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.999" end="00:49:33.339" style="s2">long history and it comes from a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.039" end="00:49:35.049" style="s2">mundane place that mundane place is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.339" end="00:49:37.450" style="s2">we just haven&#39;t had the tools to look</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.049" end="00:49:39.640" style="s2">for example inside of cells and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.450" end="00:49:41.769" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to read genomes you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.640" end="00:49:43.779" style="s2">know we could have been able to read a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.769" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">gene here and there at great expense but</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.779" end="00:49:48.130" style="s2">the ability to peer into genomes is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:49.720" style="s2">pretty new the ability to peer into</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.130" end="00:49:51.940" style="s2">these molecular pathways is pretty new</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.720" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">so anyway there&#39;s a historical bias in</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.940" end="00:49:56.200" style="s2">evolutionary biology against mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:59.289" style="s2">and in the direction of phenomenology I</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.200" end="00:50:02.230" style="s2">have never been particularly fond of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.289" end="00:50:03.819" style="s2">that bias I have always been interested</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.230" end="00:50:05.650" style="s2">in mechanism I&#39;m interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.819" end="00:50:06.910" style="s2">phenomenology too but I&#39;ve always kept</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.650" end="00:50:09.970" style="s2">my foot in the door with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.910" end="00:50:12.579" style="s2">mechanism and as an as a undergraduate I</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.970" end="00:50:14.259" style="s2">took lots of mechanism classes I took a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.579" end="00:50:16.150" style="s2">development class at the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.259" end="00:50:18.970" style="s2">developmental biology was in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.150" end="00:50:23.170" style="s2">a bit stuck it is now unstuck in a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.970" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">dramatic way but anyway I took a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.170" end="00:50:28.420" style="s2">developmental biology class I took some</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:30.220" style="s2">immunology or immuno biology and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.420" end="00:50:32.710" style="s2">I was armed with these things in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.220" end="00:50:34.329" style="s2">environment in evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.710" end="00:50:36.549" style="s2">where most people were not most people</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.329" end="00:50:39.190" style="s2">were in the phenomenology and one day I</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.549" end="00:50:40.630" style="s2">happened to be in a seminar dick</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.190" end="00:50:42.249" style="s2">Alexander was running a seminar for</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.630" end="00:50:44.289" style="s2">graduate students and a student was</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.249" end="00:50:47.650" style="s2">there who was very out of place he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.289" end="00:50:49.749" style="s2">studying cancer and he on a lark decided</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.650" end="00:50:52.119" style="s2">to take an evolution seminar that looked</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.749" end="00:50:53.349" style="s2">good to him in the catalogue and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.119" end="00:50:56.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t right for him and he gave a talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.349" end="00:50:58.660" style="s2">at some point and his talk was on his</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.200" end="00:50:59.769" style="s2">work with cancer and frankly because all</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.660" end="00:51:01.539" style="s2">the other people in the room were</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.769" end="00:51:03.340" style="s2">evolutionarily oriented nobody was</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.539" end="00:51:06.370" style="s2">really tracking what he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.340" end="00:51:09.370" style="s2">but what he said struck me like a bolt</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.370" end="00:51:12.610" style="s2">of lightning he said that in the realm</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.370" end="00:51:15.430" style="s2">of cancer research people were looking</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.610" end="00:51:19.080" style="s2">at telomeres which are these repetitive</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.430" end="00:51:23.230" style="s2">sequences at the ends of chromosomes and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.080" end="00:51:24.760" style="s2">they were toying with the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.230" end="00:51:29.230" style="s2">that the fact that these telomeres</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.760" end="00:51:32.860" style="s2">shorten every time a cell divides that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.230" end="00:51:36.250" style="s2">that is providing a resistance to tumor</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.860" end="00:51:38.410" style="s2">formation very straightforward counter</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.250" end="00:51:41.110" style="s2">counts down and that would prevent so</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.410" end="00:51:44.860" style="s2">let&#39;s just for the audience that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.110" end="00:51:49.140" style="s2">needs a tiny refresher we are taught in</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.860" end="00:51:53.710" style="s2">general that DNA is a string of letters</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.140" end="00:51:58.770" style="s2">called nucleotides AC T and G and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.710" end="00:52:03.160" style="s2">in general three of those that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.770" end="00:52:06.340" style="s2">adjacent to each other form words called</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.160" end="00:52:08.770" style="s2">codons and for every word there is an</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.340" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">amino acid or an instruction to stop</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.770" end="00:52:12.730" style="s2">coding for amino acids so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:14.680" style="s2">instruction tape that tells us how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.730" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">string together amino acids into</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.680" end="00:52:19.900" style="s2">proteins to make machines a molecular</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">machines this is some weird different</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.900" end="00:52:26.770" style="s2">thing where the region of DNA could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:30.760" style="s2">interpreted as coding for a protein but</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.770" end="00:52:33.940" style="s2">in fact might be instead just counting</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.760" end="00:52:35.980" style="s2">how many nucleotides are at the end so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.940" end="00:52:38.650" style="s2">it comes across as a counter it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.980" end="00:52:41.020" style="s2">little better it was known not to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.650" end="00:52:43.390" style="s2">coding sequence it wasn&#39;t a you see case</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.020" end="00:52:44.980" style="s2">so what you had is a bunch of DNA at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.390" end="00:52:47.110" style="s2">ends of chromosomes that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.980" end="00:52:49.150" style="s2">repetitive and the length of the number</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.110" end="00:52:51.910" style="s2">of repeats varies and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.150" end="00:52:53.620" style="s2">repeats correlates with basically how</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.910" end="00:52:56.770" style="s2">many times the cell can divide before it</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.620" end="00:52:59.710" style="s2">refuses this being interpreted as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.770" end="00:53:01.630" style="s2">cancer prevention thing made perfect</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.710" end="00:53:03.640" style="s2">sense but the reason it struck me like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.630" end="00:53:05.140" style="s2">bolt of lightning was that I was well</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.640" end="00:53:06.850" style="s2">aware of the existence of tumors and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.140" end="00:53:09.100" style="s2">their implication in something entirely</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.850" end="00:53:11.320" style="s2">different what they had been implicated</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.100" end="00:53:13.390" style="s2">in as far as I was aware was something</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.320" end="00:53:15.430" style="s2">called hayflick limits which were the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.390" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">tendency of perfectly healthy happy</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.430" end="00:53:19.690" style="s2">cells to grow and grow and grow and</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:21.579" style="s2">in a petri dish until they hit some</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.690" end="00:53:24.820" style="s2">number of divisions and then to stop</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.579" end="00:53:27.550" style="s2">without apparent dysfunction so so this</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.820" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">was the theory of Leonard hayflick yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.550" end="00:53:33.970" style="s2">it was the discovery of Leonard hayflick</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:36.670" style="s2">who basically overturned the prior</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.970" end="00:53:38.050" style="s2">wisdom about cells which was that they</p>

<p begin="00:53:38.050" end="00:53:41.380" style="s2">kept feeding him and making an</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.849" end="00:53:44.410" style="s2">environment that was conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.380" end="00:53:47.109" style="s2">division so I don&#39;t exactly know why</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.410" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">that result had been misunderstood at</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.109" end="00:53:51.130" style="s2">first maybe somebody had a cancerous</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:54.490" style="s2">cell line and so they got the wrong idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.130" end="00:53:56.320" style="s2">and it just spread but hayflick checked</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.490" end="00:53:57.609" style="s2">it and it turned out to be false turned</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.320" end="00:53:59.470" style="s2">out there was a number of cell divisions</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.609" end="00:54:02.920" style="s2">that healthy cells would go through and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.470" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">then they&#39;d stop the mechanism was not</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.920" end="00:54:08.050" style="s2">obvious to a flick but later it became</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.570" style="s2">clearer and clearer that the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.050" end="00:54:12.760" style="s2">was these sequences at the ends of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.570" end="00:54:17.079" style="s2">chromosomes which shorten each time the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.760" end="00:54:19.720" style="s2">cell divides and the implication was</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.079" end="00:54:21.849" style="s2">that potentially this was a cause of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.720" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">what we call senescence well in common</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.849" end="00:54:26.140" style="s2">parlance would often be called aging the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:28.869" style="s2">tendency to grow feeble and inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.140" end="00:54:30.849" style="s2">with age if your cells are each in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.869" end="00:54:32.440" style="s2">cell line and that line has a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.849" end="00:54:35.290" style="s2">number of times that it can replace</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.440" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">itself before it has to stop then some</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.290" end="00:54:41.290" style="s2">point your repair program starts to fail</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:44.589" style="s2">and that repair program failing across</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.290" end="00:54:47.500" style="s2">the body looks like what you would</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.589" end="00:54:49.060" style="s2">expect aging aging follows the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.500" end="00:54:50.650" style="s2">you would expect if cell lines one by</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.060" end="00:54:52.780" style="s2">one stopped being able to replace</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.650" end="00:54:56.710" style="s2">themselves so we know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.780" end="00:54:57.910" style="s2">special sort of I don&#39;t want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.710" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">cell line because you can keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.910" end="00:55:03.700" style="s2">correcting me for every tiny mistake I</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2">make in speech but if we divide our our</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.700" end="00:55:09.190" style="s2">body into two kinds of cells soma and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.250" end="00:55:10.420" style="s2">germ we&#39;re germ lines are that which has</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.190" end="00:55:14.020" style="s2">a hope of immortality through</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.420" end="00:55:19.480" style="s2">reproduction then it&#39;s the somatic cells</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.020" end="00:55:24.220" style="s2">that have finite limits on their ability</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.480" end="00:55:26.770" style="s2">to undergo mitosis and cellular repair</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.220" end="00:55:28.750" style="s2">and and whatnot and the germline can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.770" end="00:55:30.670" style="s2">because if it did you your lineage would</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.750" end="00:55:32.320" style="s2">go extinct as a result of small</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.670" end="00:55:34.600" style="s2">smaller than the small addendum so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.320" end="00:55:38.320" style="s2">the soma the parts of your body that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.600" end="00:55:40.930" style="s2">don&#39;t go on to produce babies that have</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.320" end="00:55:42.340" style="s2">this effect the reason it&#39;s struck me</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.930" end="00:55:44.860" style="s2">like a bolt of lightning was that I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.340" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">aware of another very elegant piece of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.860" end="00:55:49.420" style="s2">research done by a guy named George</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:50.950" style="s2">Williams George Williams had finally one</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.420" end="00:55:52.390" style="s2">of the greatest of modern one</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.950" end="00:55:55.480" style="s2">illusionary one of the greatest modern</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.390" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">evolutionary biologists I actually knew</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.480" end="00:56:00.850" style="s2">him a bit too he is also now gone</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:03.670" style="s2">unfortunately but George Williams had</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.850" end="00:56:06.820" style="s2">laid out in a beautifully elegant paper</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.670" end="00:56:09.430" style="s2">the evolutionary theory of senescence it</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.820" end="00:56:16.150" style="s2">is an absolutely elegant argument that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.430" end="00:56:17.260" style="s2">says that in a lifetime there are well</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.150" end="00:56:23.430" style="s2">let&#39;s start somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.260" end="00:56:27.430" style="s2">a creature is built of parts and traits</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.430" end="00:56:29.710" style="s2">it has a relatively small genome and a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.430" end="00:56:31.090" style="s2">relatively high complexity at the time</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.710" end="00:56:34.300" style="s2">it was thought there might be a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.090" end="00:56:37.060" style="s2">thousand genes or something and you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.300" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">maybe 30 trillion cells with a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.060" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">complexity in order to get that small</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:46.800" style="s2">number of genes to dictate how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:50.760" style="s2">produce a creature that complex the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.800" end="00:56:54.700" style="s2">genes are doing multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.760" end="00:56:56.620" style="s2">Williams point was when a gene has</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.700" end="00:57:01.120" style="s2">multiple effects what we call a playa</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.620" end="00:57:04.870" style="s2">trophy those effects may be good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.120" end="00:57:06.430" style="s2">if effects are good early in life by</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.870" end="00:57:09.190" style="s2">good we mean contributing to fitness</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:12.370" style="s2">fitness enhancing rates at some cost</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.190" end="00:57:14.350" style="s2">late in life then they will tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.370" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">accumulated by selection and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.350" end="00:57:18.580" style="s2">for that is because well there are two</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.690" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">ways to think of it really if a trait</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.580" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">occurs if a negative trait occurs very</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:25.600" style="s2">late in life then a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:27.400" style="s2">individuals who have the gene for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.600" end="00:57:29.590" style="s2">trait will not live long enough to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.400" end="00:57:31.540" style="s2">experience the harm so if it came bound</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.590" end="00:57:33.100" style="s2">to a positive thing early in life and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.540" end="00:57:35.550" style="s2">you&#39;re dead before the late-life harm</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.100" end="00:57:38.800" style="s2">accrues you got away with it right so</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.550" end="00:57:40.690" style="s2">Williams point was he was building on</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.800" end="00:57:43.600" style="s2">earlier work of Medawar but let&#39;s skip</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.690" end="00:57:47.230" style="s2">that for the moment his point was</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.600" end="00:57:49.720" style="s2">because of trade offs you will have lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.230" end="00:57:52.510" style="s2">of traits that are good and bad late</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.720" end="00:57:54.040" style="s2">selection sees the early traits much</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.510" end="00:57:56.230" style="s2">more clearly than it sees the late</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.040" end="00:57:57.970" style="s2">traits and it prioritizes them because</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.230" end="00:57:59.380" style="s2">of the discounting that arises because</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.970" end="00:58:01.540" style="s2">so many individuals aren&#39;t around to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.380" end="00:58:03.220" style="s2">experience the late life harm and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.540" end="00:58:04.930" style="s2">they are around to experience the late</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.220" end="00:58:07.240" style="s2">life harm a lot of their reproduction is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.930" end="00:58:09.460" style="s2">behind them anyway so they count less</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.240" end="00:58:13.120" style="s2">selection counts more early in life and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.460" end="00:58:15.190" style="s2">this timer starts at the moment of first</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.120" end="00:58:19.390" style="s2">reproduction the usual moment of first</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.190" end="00:58:22.320" style="s2">viability for your species so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.390" end="00:58:26.170" style="s2">beautiful hypothesis and it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.320" end="00:58:28.750" style="s2">beautifully articulated with many</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.170" end="00:58:31.240" style="s2">predictions which is the way really good</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.750" end="00:58:33.490" style="s2">work is done and we knew at the point</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.240" end="00:58:35.980" style="s2">that I was entering graduate school we</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.490" end="00:58:38.140" style="s2">knew that the the the hypothesis was</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.980" end="00:58:39.880" style="s2">right it was a theory and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.140" end="00:58:42.100" style="s2">that we knew it was really bothers is is</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.880" end="00:58:44.230" style="s2">the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.100" end="00:58:45.670" style="s2">antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis for</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.230" end="00:58:49.180" style="s2">senescence we knew that it was right</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.670" end="00:58:50.980" style="s2">because it predicted so many phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.180" end="00:58:52.330" style="s2">in nature that we could readily go out</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.980" end="00:58:54.370" style="s2">and measure and this is again where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.330" end="00:58:56.740" style="s2">phenomenology versus mechanism comes in</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.370" end="00:58:59.620" style="s2">okay we know that creatures that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.740" end="00:59:02.190" style="s2">poisonous or have a shell that protects</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.620" end="00:59:04.360" style="s2">them or can fly away from danger are</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.190" end="00:59:06.970" style="s2">disproportionately long-lived</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.360" end="00:59:09.190" style="s2">for their size small creatures tend to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.970" end="00:59:11.530" style="s2">live shorter lives them than large</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.190" end="00:59:13.300" style="s2">creatures but if you can fly then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.530" end="00:59:15.790" style="s2">off the line of the other creatures of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.300" end="00:59:18.700" style="s2">your size so for example they&#39;re small</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.790" end="00:59:21.750" style="s2">bats who have been recovered after 30</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.700" end="00:59:24.040" style="s2">years in the wild so creatures that have</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.750" end="00:59:26.020" style="s2">special protections have</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.040" end="00:59:30.610" style="s2">disproportionate longevity this matches</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.020" end="00:59:32.260" style="s2">Williams hypothesis because it is their</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.610" end="00:59:34.420" style="s2">ability to fly away from danger that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.260" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">makes the likelihood of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.420" end="00:59:39.340" style="s2">experiencing late life costs go up so</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.640" end="00:59:41.500" style="s2">selection sees their late life more</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.340" end="00:59:43.480" style="s2">easily than it sees a small creature I</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.500" end="00:59:44.350" style="s2">just want to say something yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.480" end="00:59:46.330" style="s2">a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.350" end="00:59:49.390" style="s2">it&#39;s an unusual podcast and we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.330" end="00:59:52.090" style="s2">science and I&#39;m thrilled but you we</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.390" end="00:59:54.010" style="s2">always have our colleagues in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.090" end="00:59:55.450" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking to a general audience</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.010" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">and the colleagues are always in a</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:01.100" style="s2">forgot about this you didn&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.710" end="01:00:02.420" style="s2">that I&#39;m even interjecting little bits</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.100" end="01:00:04.700" style="s2">because I want to make sure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.420" end="01:00:05.900" style="s2">immunized from all the bullshit um that</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.700" end="01:00:07.970" style="s2">the a cadet so I just want to make a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.900" end="01:00:09.470" style="s2">general statement which is we can come</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.970" end="01:00:11.390" style="s2">back and get into any level of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.470" end="01:00:13.640" style="s2">specificity that somebody wants to if</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.390" end="01:00:15.290" style="s2">they want to take you down I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.640" end="01:00:18.260" style="s2">what I&#39;d love to do is to tell the story</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.290" end="01:00:19.940" style="s2">with enough punch that people understand</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.260" end="01:00:23.770" style="s2">what happened we&#39;re about to jump into</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.940" end="01:00:26.660" style="s2">the let&#39;s do the meat of the matter the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.770" end="01:00:30.440" style="s2">theory of antagonistic pleiotropy was</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.660" end="01:00:32.869" style="s2">well established but in four decades of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.440" end="01:00:35.210" style="s2">research on the genome nobody had found</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.869" end="01:00:37.280" style="s2">a gene that matched it so we knew that</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.210" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">this explanation was right but we</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.280" end="01:00:42.440" style="s2">couldn&#39;t find the genes that caused it</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:44.150" style="s2">the mechanism was missing so anyway need</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.440" end="01:00:49.250" style="s2">to be a gene it has to be protein coding</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.150" end="01:00:51.500" style="s2">yeah anyway I knew this a sort of me I</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.250" end="01:00:54.109" style="s2">was well familiar with Williams paper at</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.500" end="01:00:58.310" style="s2">the point that I saw this talk on cancer</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.109" end="01:01:01.700" style="s2">and I knew already about the question of</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.310" end="01:01:03.560" style="s2">senescence everything came together this</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.700" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">was obviously the answer where the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.560" end="01:01:07.220" style="s2">missing quiet ropey was well the missing</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:09.560" style="s2">pleiotropy had to do with a telomere</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.220" end="01:01:12.109" style="s2">which wasn&#39;t exactly a gene it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.560" end="01:01:14.150" style="s2">genetic it was DNA but it wasn&#39;t a gene</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.109" end="01:01:16.430" style="s2">but it was perfectly capable of</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.150" end="01:01:18.770" style="s2">producing exactly the effects that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.430" end="01:01:20.690" style="s2">see in senescence across the body tissue</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.770" end="01:01:24.500" style="s2">account or not a protein could be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.690" end="01:01:27.350" style="s2">answer now I saw this instantly at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.500" end="01:01:29.540" style="s2">point I heard this talk I raised my hand</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.350" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">and I tried to articulate what was so</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.540" end="01:01:33.590" style="s2">obvious in that moment and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:35.300" style="s2">compel a single person in the room</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.590" end="01:01:37.609" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t even understand what I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.300" end="01:01:39.200" style="s2">trying to say and that is bizarre it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.609" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">bizarre meaning dick was in the room and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.200" end="01:01:46.250" style="s2">you know dick was very broad-minded and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:47.750" style="s2">I just couldn&#39;t make it clear ok let me</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.250" end="01:01:49.880" style="s2">just interject something you can correct</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.750" end="01:01:54.070" style="s2">me if I&#39;m wrong but my impression of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.880" end="01:01:58.250" style="s2">is that it was a very simple idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.070" end="01:02:00.800" style="s2">attended to by an outrageous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.250" end="01:02:04.369" style="s2">irrelevant complexity that had to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.800" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">very carefully pried off of the central</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.369" end="01:02:10.370" style="s2">idea yeah I think I think that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.280" end="01:02:12.200" style="s2">well said so anyway I left the room</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.370" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">feeling like I had just glimpsed</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.200" end="01:02:16.730" style="s2">something so important you know I</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:19.760" style="s2">wondered could it be right and I started</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.730" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">to just do the first bit of library</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">research to figure out whether somebody</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:26.660" style="s2">else knew what I knew or so I&#39;m named</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">sure that you fully said it I want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.660" end="01:02:29.990" style="s2">make sure that I mean been clear on it</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:32.120" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna I think I&#39;m right but it</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.990" end="01:02:38.060" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.120" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">saying is what if the hayflick limit is</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.060" end="01:02:44.170" style="s2">a protection against dying from</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:46.910" style="s2">immortality at a psychological level</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.170" end="01:02:48.320" style="s2">that is some cell gets a dream of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.910" end="01:02:49.820" style="s2">immortality that it shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.320" end="01:02:52.310" style="s2">because let&#39;s say it&#39;s a somatic cell</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.820" end="01:02:54.080" style="s2">and it says okay I just want to keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.310" end="01:02:55.970" style="s2">dividing and dividing dividing nature</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.080" end="01:02:58.220" style="s2">knows how to do this and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.970" end="01:03:01.070" style="s2">immortality which sounds good at first</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.220" end="01:03:03.050" style="s2">is actually called cancer yeah and so in</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.070" end="01:03:05.150" style="s2">computer science we would say okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.050" end="01:03:08.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve introduced a recursion limit into</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.150" end="01:03:09.740" style="s2">a while loop or a for loop to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.120" end="01:03:13.070" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have a resource leak</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.740" end="01:03:15.290" style="s2">which is what a tumor is yeah so let me</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.070" end="01:03:17.050" style="s2">say it this way if you have a damage to</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.290" end="01:03:20.030" style="s2">a tissue cut on your arm or something</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.050" end="01:03:22.610" style="s2">the cells on both sides of that cut</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.030" end="01:03:25.070" style="s2">suddenly become aware that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.610" end="01:03:26.780" style="s2">problem a gap because they can&#39;t hear a</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.070" end="01:03:28.460" style="s2">neighbor on one side of them and their</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.780" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">natural reaction is to start growing</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.460" end="01:03:32.390" style="s2">into the gap until they can hear a</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">neighbor which is the sign to stop if</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.390" end="01:03:35.570" style="s2">you imagine that something like that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:39.590" style="s2">occurring in every tissue there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.570" end="01:03:41.660" style="s2">almost every tissue the problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.590" end="01:03:44.660" style="s2">that means that every tissue in your</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.660" end="01:03:48.350" style="s2">body for which that story is about right</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.660" end="01:03:49.670" style="s2">he&#39;s in danger of having damage from</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.350" end="01:03:52.190" style="s2">radiation or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.670" end="01:03:53.690" style="s2">turn it deaf to its neighbors a single</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.190" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">cell that has turned deaf to its</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.690" end="01:03:57.230" style="s2">neighbors will suddenly start</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:03:59.240" style="s2">replicating and if it is deaf to its</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.230" end="01:04:00.410" style="s2">neighbors then there&#39;s no message that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.240" end="01:04:02.810" style="s2">it&#39;s going to hear that&#39;s gonna tell it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.410" end="01:04:04.370" style="s2">to stop so that thing imagine any cell</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.810" end="01:04:06.290" style="s2">in your body just taking off and growing</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.370" end="01:04:08.090" style="s2">and growing and growing because this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.290" end="01:04:10.430" style="s2">terrifying what you&#39;re saying to me is</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.090" end="01:04:14.170" style="s2">is that if I&#39;m comprised of let&#39;s say 30</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.430" end="01:04:18.580" style="s2">trillion cells and I view them as each</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.170" end="01:04:23.660" style="s2">let&#39;s say subroutines any subroutine</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.580" end="01:04:24.170" style="s2">that is not D nucleated right like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.660" end="01:04:26.990" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.170" end="01:04:29.059" style="s2">in the in the lens of your eye because</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.990" end="01:04:32.390" style="s2">the the nucleus has been removed but any</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.059" end="01:04:35.990" style="s2">other reasonable cell is potentially</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.390" end="01:04:39.470" style="s2">your assassin because it&#39;s mitosis</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.990" end="01:04:43.400" style="s2">process might completely go rogue can</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.470" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">run away okay and so the rather elegant</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.400" end="01:04:47.660" style="s2">and very simple idea is that there would</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:49.579" style="s2">be a hard limit so that any cell that</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.660" end="01:04:51.799" style="s2">had become damaged so it started down</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.579" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">this path would just simply run into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.799" end="01:04:55.130" style="s2">number of cell divisions it was allowed</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:57.040" style="s2">in a lifetime and it would stop so like</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.130" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">the moles on my face that some of my</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.040" end="01:05:03.500" style="s2">less couth commenters love to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:05.000" style="s2">yeah are effectively attempts to kill me</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.500" end="01:05:06.619" style="s2">that may have stopped and that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.000" end="01:05:08.359" style="s2">perimeter where they stopped is where</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.619" end="01:05:10.910" style="s2">the hayflick limit took over and said</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.359" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">this the cell line must die so that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.910" end="01:05:15.799" style="s2">patient will live yeah the name I gave</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:18.680" style="s2">him was proto tumor and the idea is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.799" end="01:05:21.230" style="s2">proto tumor is a patch of cells arrested</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.680" end="01:05:23.450" style="s2">at their hayflick limit because they had</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.230" end="01:05:25.040" style="s2">become unregulated if you go to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.450" end="01:05:26.900" style="s2">dermatologist and you say what do I look</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.040" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">for you know they tell you certain</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.900" end="01:05:30.890" style="s2">things to look for so a round patch of</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">cells that suddenly becomes irregular in</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.890" end="01:05:33.319" style="s2">shape well that&#39;s what would happen if</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:34.940" style="s2">you took one of those cells and gave it</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.319" end="01:05:38.180" style="s2">a second mutation and it started growing</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.940" end="01:05:40.520" style="s2">again got it right so anyway the idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.180" end="01:05:42.470" style="s2">that a limit on cellular reproduction</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.520" end="01:05:43.970" style="s2">yep is adaptive to protect you from</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.470" end="01:05:45.799" style="s2">cancer there&#39;s a little bit of a mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.970" end="01:05:47.690" style="s2">bender because what you&#39;re telling me is</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.799" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">is that I&#39;ve got to avoid immortality</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.690" end="01:05:55.400" style="s2">which can kill me and that the solution</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:57.589" style="s2">to not dying is death yes and that what</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.400" end="01:05:59.510" style="s2">selection does is it balances these two</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.589" end="01:06:02.000" style="s2">competing forces to give you as much</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.510" end="01:06:04.190" style="s2">vigor and longevity as all of the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.000" end="01:06:06.829" style="s2">diseases and insults and things that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.190" end="01:06:10.430" style="s2">can die from sort of start to fade away</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.829" end="01:06:13.609" style="s2">and at the complete core of biology in</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.430" end="01:06:16.150" style="s2">this theory there are two things that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.609" end="01:06:19.339" style="s2">can&#39;t get away from one of which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.150" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">death by immortality and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.339" end="01:06:25.250" style="s2">is death by recursion limit that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:26.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a very elegant thing and now the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.250" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">problem is is that there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.780" end="01:06:30.200" style="s2">weird attendant complexity that you had</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:34.099" style="s2">to deal with right like stem cells</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.200" end="01:06:36.589" style="s2">versus germ versus so when I went into</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.099" end="01:06:37.880" style="s2">the literature what I found was that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.589" end="01:06:39.880" style="s2">people had played a</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.880" end="01:06:42.920" style="s2">in the neighborhood but that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.880" end="01:06:44.630" style="s2">particular fact which blocked every</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.920" end="01:06:47.960" style="s2">attempt to make sense of what was going</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.630" end="01:06:50.090" style="s2">on and the fact was that rodents were</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.960" end="01:06:55.370" style="s2">understood to have ultra-long</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.090" end="01:06:56.870" style="s2">hypervariable teen Lanier&#39;s and i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.370" end="01:07:00.320" style="s2">know what that meant at first but the</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.870" end="01:07:03.790" style="s2">more I looked into this possibility the</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.320" end="01:07:06.680" style="s2">more I realized that dozens of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.790" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">long-standing problems would be solved</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.680" end="01:07:12.560" style="s2">if my hypothesis was true but that my</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:15.080" style="s2">hypothesis couldn&#39;t be true because</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.560" end="01:07:16.990" style="s2">basically mice have long telomeres and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.080" end="01:07:20.390" style="s2">short lives why is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.990" end="01:07:22.310" style="s2">and I banged my head on the table for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.390" end="01:07:24.350" style="s2">couple weeks trying to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.310" end="01:07:28.900" style="s2">going on yes maybe even literally I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.350" end="01:07:31.100" style="s2">get on occasion but the question was I</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.900" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">began to wonder if there was something</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.100" end="01:07:36.260" style="s2">wrong with the idea that mice had long</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:38.150" style="s2">telomeres sometimes like in hay flix</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.260" end="01:07:40.430" style="s2">case it turned out that a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.150" end="01:07:41.870" style="s2">people were copying some wrong result in</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.430" end="01:07:44.330" style="s2">it so it seemed like a lot of people had</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.870" end="01:07:47.360" style="s2">seen it but only one hand I checked was</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.330" end="01:07:49.460" style="s2">it true that there was something that</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.360" end="01:07:50.870" style="s2">everybody was parroting one study that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.460" end="01:07:52.610" style="s2">said mice had long telomeres and right</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.870" end="01:07:54.350" style="s2">turns out lots of people had tested it</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.610" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">might have long telomeres like ten times</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.350" end="01:08:02.630" style="s2">the length of human telomeres it just</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:08:05.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t fit so finally it occurred to me</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.630" end="01:08:08.300" style="s2">that it was possible that what was going</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.210" end="01:08:10.700" style="s2">on I discovered something in trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.300" end="01:08:12.560" style="s2">figure out what they meant by mice right</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.700" end="01:08:14.750" style="s2">might there&#39;s a lot of species of mice</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.560" end="01:08:17.180" style="s2">but all the mice that we use in the lab</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.750" end="01:08:18.800" style="s2">with rare exception are from one genus</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.180" end="01:08:20.540" style="s2">and often from a particular target</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.800" end="01:08:22.730" style="s2">species you were focused if I recall</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.540" end="01:08:24.950" style="s2">correctly a moose praedyth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.730" end="01:08:27.110" style="s2">no no not a schoolís mus musculus but</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.950" end="01:08:31.070" style="s2">still common one yeah what shocked me</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.110" end="01:08:33.230" style="s2">was that it turned out all the mus</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.070" end="01:08:35.600" style="s2">musculus that were being used in labs</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.230" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">across the country and in many cases</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.600" end="01:08:39.590" style="s2">farther afield than that were coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:41.450" style="s2">from one place which I had no idea there</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.590" end="01:08:43.760" style="s2">was one I remember getting a phone call</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.450" end="01:08:45.950" style="s2">when you said what do you know about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.760" end="01:08:48.110" style="s2">Jack&#39;s lab did Jack&#39;s lab in Bar Harbor</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.950" end="01:08:50.570" style="s2">Maine right they seem to be the source</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.110" end="01:08:51.470" style="s2">of everybody&#39;s mice and so it began to</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.570" end="01:08:53.750" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.470" end="01:08:55.580" style="s2">it was a possibility I could not shut</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.750" end="01:08:57.380" style="s2">down in my mind that there was something</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.580" end="01:08:59.780" style="s2">about what was going on at the Jax lab</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.380" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">that had resulted in the mice that were</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.780" end="01:09:03.800" style="s2">being sent out to all these other</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:06.500" style="s2">Lassiter were representative animals</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.800" end="01:09:08.230" style="s2">right these are model organism people</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.500" end="01:09:11.210" style="s2">were just using mice because my sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.230" end="01:09:14.420" style="s2">convenient mammal but they&#39;re all coming</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.210" end="01:09:18.080" style="s2">from one place and it began to occur to</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.420" end="01:09:20.720" style="s2">me that that one place was not just a</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.080" end="01:09:23.740" style="s2">source of mice in the sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.720" end="01:09:27.020" style="s2">might think it it was actually a</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.740" end="01:09:28.700" style="s2">selective environment that was impacting</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.020" end="01:09:31.550" style="s2">those mice and when I dug deeper it</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.700" end="01:09:33.890" style="s2">turned out that the mice had all they</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.550" end="01:09:35.750" style="s2">were descendants of a long lineage that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.890" end="01:09:40.430" style="s2">had lived in captivity under conditions</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.750" end="01:09:42.080" style="s2">at the Jax lab and at some point I</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.430" end="01:09:43.790" style="s2">realized that the most likely thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.080" end="01:09:45.920" style="s2">going on was that there was something</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.790" end="01:09:47.780" style="s2">about this environment that had wildly</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">elongated the telomeres of these mice</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.780" end="01:09:51.590" style="s2">and that was simultaneously an</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:52.910" style="s2">unbelievable idea but the only one I</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.590" end="01:09:54.710" style="s2">could think of that made sense of</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.910" end="01:09:56.750" style="s2">everything I had seen and so well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.710" end="01:09:58.550" style="s2">unbelievable because the consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.750" end="01:10:01.880" style="s2">it yeah I mean look I have not even</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.550" end="01:10:05.270" style="s2">heard whether anyone has said yeah we we</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.880" end="01:10:09.110" style="s2">did that we screwed that up but it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.270" end="01:10:12.200" style="s2">like your MA your favorite model</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.110" end="01:10:15.770" style="s2">organism from mammalian trials being</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.200" end="01:10:18.530" style="s2">screwed up by a central facility because</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.770" end="01:10:20.870" style="s2">also there&#39;s this weird thing where</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.530" end="01:10:23.240" style="s2">medical people very often stop taking</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.870" end="01:10:24.710" style="s2">into account evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.240" end="01:10:26.360" style="s2">because they treat that as well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.710" end="01:10:29.860" style="s2">that class I took in college or the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.360" end="01:10:32.630" style="s2">beginning of graduate school right so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.860" end="01:10:34.700" style="s2">began to focus on this question and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.630" end="01:10:36.170" style="s2">did something that was the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.700" end="01:10:39.500" style="s2">to do but I did it in a way I will</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.170" end="01:10:40.940" style="s2">forever regret I found somebody who was</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.500" end="01:10:44.420" style="s2">represented in the literature who I</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.940" end="01:10:46.040" style="s2">regarded as very well-versed they made</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.420" end="01:10:48.260" style="s2">sense to me their papers her name was</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.040" end="01:10:50.380" style="s2">Carol Greider Carol Greider is now a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.260" end="01:10:55.100" style="s2">Nobel laureate she was not at the time</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.380" end="01:10:57.830" style="s2">she was the co-discoverer of the enzyme</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.100" end="01:11:01.160" style="s2">telomerase which is the enzyme that</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.830" end="01:11:04.860" style="s2">elongates telomeres when that occurs</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.160" end="01:11:06.840" style="s2">with the famous in Co Nobel</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.860" end="01:11:08.550" style="s2">that she was the student of Elizabeth</p>

<p begin="01:11:08.550" end="01:11:14.119" style="s2">she was her student and they shared the</p>

<p begin="01:11:14.119" end="01:11:21.179" style="s2">her work seemed good to me I called her</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.340" end="01:11:23.670" style="s2">up cold you know I went into the insect</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.179" end="01:11:24.989" style="s2">division office and I sat down to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.670" end="01:11:26.760" style="s2">phone I called her I said Carol you</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.989" end="01:11:28.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know me I&#39;m a graduate student at</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.760" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">Michigan I&#39;m an evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.380" end="01:11:33.989" style="s2">I&#39;m racking my brains trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:37.770" style="s2">understand something can you tell me is</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.989" end="01:11:40.139" style="s2">it possible that mice don&#39;t have ultra</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.770" end="01:11:43.770" style="s2">long telomeres that it&#39;s only laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.139" end="01:11:45.300" style="s2">mice to do and she said huh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.770" end="01:11:48.270" style="s2">really interesting I&#39;m pretty sure that</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.300" end="01:11:51.119" style="s2">mice have long telomeres universally but</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.270" end="01:11:53.460" style="s2">it is odd that if you order must spread</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.119" end="01:11:56.130" style="s2">us instead of mus musculus and you order</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.460" end="01:11:58.170" style="s2">from European suppliers the lengths are</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.130" end="01:12:01.219" style="s2">very different than what you get if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.170" end="01:12:04.380" style="s2">order mus musculus from the tactics lab</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.219" end="01:12:07.969" style="s2">and I said whoa and she said yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.380" end="01:12:10.080" style="s2">really interesting and then she said I</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.969" end="01:12:11.639" style="s2">can&#39;t remember if it was the same phone</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:13.500" style="s2">caller if we had a second phone call but</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.639" end="01:12:15.210" style="s2">she said she was gonna put her student</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.500" end="01:12:18.300" style="s2">her graduate student Mike Heyman who I</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.210" end="01:12:19.409" style="s2">think is now at MIT on the project and</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.300" end="01:12:20.760" style="s2">he was going to do a little work to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.409" end="01:12:25.650" style="s2">figure out whether there was anything to</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.760" end="01:12:28.020" style="s2">this and Mike did some work they sourced</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.650" end="01:12:30.420" style="s2">some different strains of mice that were</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.020" end="01:12:31.949" style="s2">they were actually not wild mice might</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.420" end="01:12:33.989" style="s2">wild mice would have been the right test</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.949" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">but she couldn&#39;t get wild mice for</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.989" end="01:12:37.860" style="s2">obvious reason it&#39;s about the woods</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:39.719" style="s2">right exactly and so she got several</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.860" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">different strains of mice that had just</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.719" end="01:12:43.739" style="s2">been in captivity much less time she</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:45.150" style="s2">actually got one strain of mice that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.739" end="01:12:46.170" style="s2">treated very differently in captivity</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.150" end="01:12:48.150" style="s2">but never mind</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.170" end="01:12:49.980" style="s2">I should put her graduating on it he</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.150" end="01:12:53.460" style="s2">measured their telomere lines and I get</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.980" end="01:12:56.610" style="s2">this excited email Mike &#39;man sends me an</p>

<p begin="01:13:28.670" end="01:13:38.330" style="s2">email I was it was 1999 98 something</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.330" end="01:13:45.110" style="s2">okay so over 20 years ago yeah so I get</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.350" end="01:13:48.590" style="s2">this email and by the way that puts you</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.110" end="01:13:51.710" style="s2">at about 30 you&#39;re at the beginning of</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.440" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">environmental insult is more or less</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.990" end="01:16:16.700" style="s2">possible what you do is you don&#39;t breed</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.120" end="01:16:18.830" style="s2">animals past eight months they breed</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.700" end="01:16:21.710" style="s2">faster when they&#39;re younger because of</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.830" end="01:16:23.120" style="s2">senescence and so you don&#39;t breed older</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.710" end="01:16:24.650" style="s2">mice you throw them out and you replace</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.120" end="01:16:27.970" style="s2">him with younger mice who breed faster</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.650" end="01:16:31.400" style="s2">what that effectively did was it</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.970" end="01:16:34.820" style="s2">eliminated the selection against cancer</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.400" end="01:16:38.780" style="s2">and it turbocharged the selection in</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.820" end="01:16:41.420" style="s2">favor of useless forgiveness in general</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.780" end="01:16:44.330" style="s2">almost all cancer the cancer of the</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.330" end="01:16:49.970" style="s2">the other cancer in general is much more</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.670" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">common later in life I got a pause I</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.970" end="01:16:53.090" style="s2">realized I forgot to tell you one thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.440" end="01:16:56.180" style="s2">Carol told me in my first phone call</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.090" end="01:16:58.340" style="s2">that&#39;s vital in addition to telling me</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.180" end="01:17:01.130" style="s2">that there was something funny about mas</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.340" end="01:17:03.890" style="s2">Freitas she told me that consistent with</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.130" end="01:17:07.610" style="s2">the hypothesis that I was conveying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.890" end="01:17:09.140" style="s2">her that all mice die of cancer she said</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.610" end="01:17:12.530" style="s2">if you let him live long enough and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.140" end="01:17:13.790" style="s2">you do the necropsy you find cancer of</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.530" end="01:17:15.230" style="s2">one kind or another and that was</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.790" end="01:17:18.050" style="s2">perfectly consistent because they had</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.230" end="01:17:19.280" style="s2">these wildly long telomeres and no</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.050" end="01:17:21.650" style="s2">cancer protection that would be the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.280" end="01:17:23.780" style="s2">prediction that high cotton it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.650" end="01:17:25.880" style="s2">not really all mice it&#39;s all mice that</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.780" end="01:17:28.250" style="s2">we see in the lab which happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.880" end="01:17:29.750" style="s2">the mice that are ordered right she was</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.250" end="01:17:31.460" style="s2">still speaking from the mindset of</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.750" end="01:17:33.230" style="s2">somebody who thought that the mice she</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.460" end="01:17:35.540" style="s2">was getting in the mail represent</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.230" end="01:17:37.310" style="s2">representative of mice and the wad okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.540" end="01:17:39.710" style="s2">so let me clear up why the breeding</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.310" end="01:17:41.960" style="s2">protocol and I should say that it is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.710" end="01:17:44.660" style="s2">breeding protocol that is causing this</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.960" end="01:17:45.520" style="s2">that part I would say is still a</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.660" end="01:17:47.230" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.520" end="01:17:49.540" style="s2">it has not been directly tested by</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.230" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">anybody but what I would say is many</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.540" end="01:17:54.520" style="s2">hypotheses were tested in the aftermath</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:56.830" style="s2">of the discovery that that lab mice have</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.520" end="01:18:00.280" style="s2">bizarrely long telomeres and wild mice</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.830" end="01:18:01.510" style="s2">don&#39;t and no other hypothesis has stood</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.280" end="01:18:04.000" style="s2">up to scrutiny so does the last</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.510" end="01:18:05.260" style="s2">hypothesis standing and I&#39;m all but</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.000" end="01:18:07.570" style="s2">certain that it will turn out to be true</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.260" end="01:18:10.150" style="s2">yeah the reason that the breeding</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.570" end="01:18:11.500" style="s2">protocol has this weird effect is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.150" end="01:18:14.770" style="s2">when you throw out the mice at eight</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.500" end="01:18:15.640" style="s2">months of age you eliminate selection</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.770" end="01:18:18.280" style="s2">against cancer</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.640" end="01:18:19.840" style="s2">you turbocharged selection in favor of</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.280" end="01:18:21.430" style="s2">Zoar when you throw out the mice for</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.840" end="01:18:23.050" style="s2">breeding purposes at eight months right</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.430" end="01:18:25.140" style="s2">okay you throw them out for breeding</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.050" end="01:18:27.850" style="s2">purposes at eight months of age you are</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.140" end="01:18:30.790" style="s2">increasing the importance of their early</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.850" end="01:18:32.470" style="s2">life breeding and you are discounting</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.790" end="01:18:34.690" style="s2">anything related to their ability to</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.470" end="01:18:36.100" style="s2">fend off cancer because they don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.690" end="01:18:38.470" style="s2">long enough in that period of time to</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.100" end="01:18:40.480" style="s2">get cancers that kill them and so what</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.470" end="01:18:44.980" style="s2">has happened according to this</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.480" end="01:18:48.040" style="s2">hypothesis is that the mice that have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.980" end="01:18:50.230" style="s2">longer telomeres have driven out the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.040" end="01:18:51.850" style="s2">other animals from the colony the trait</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.230" end="01:18:53.590" style="s2">of having long telomeres has swept</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.850" end="01:18:55.800" style="s2">through the colony and the telomeres</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.590" end="01:18:58.720" style="s2">have been elongated to an absurd degree</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.800" end="01:18:59.200" style="s2">creating animals that do all die of</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.720" end="01:19:00.970" style="s2">cancer</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.200" end="01:19:03.040" style="s2">and interestingly enough another thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.970" end="01:19:05.800" style="s2">that&#39;s evident from the literature is</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.040" end="01:19:08.410" style="s2">that if you look at their tissues their</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.800" end="01:19:10.990" style="s2">tissues do not age in the way that a</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.410" end="01:19:13.300" style="s2">normal mammals tissues age they remain</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.990" end="01:19:15.680" style="s2">young well so there&#39;s one aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.300" end="01:19:16.860" style="s2">aging but that there&#39;s a far darker</p>

<p begin="01:20:15.420" end="01:20:19.199" style="s2">Debbie seasick okay I&#39;m and Debbie was</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.099" end="01:20:21.599" style="s2">an excellent co-author strong</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.199" end="01:20:23.039" style="s2">contributor to the paper anyway we put</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.599" end="01:20:25.650" style="s2">together over the course of a year I</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.039" end="01:20:29.400" style="s2">took a break from effectively my real</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.650" end="01:20:31.650" style="s2">dissertation work and wrote a paper dick</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.400" end="01:20:33.929" style="s2">thought it was a fantastic paper he was</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.650" end="01:20:37.249" style="s2">blown away by this wide remember the</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.929" end="01:20:40.079" style="s2">revisions and I remember this was like I</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.249" end="01:20:44.099" style="s2">mean if I think about what&#39;s on the line</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.079" end="01:20:45.480" style="s2">like this combines one of these freak</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.099" end="01:20:47.249" style="s2">situations where you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.480" end="01:20:49.530" style="s2">evolutionary theory to protect to</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.249" end="01:20:51.510" style="s2">predict something and in this case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.530" end="01:20:53.280" style="s2">at the level of molecular biology so</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.510" end="01:20:55.320" style="s2">with Darwin&#39;s our orchid it&#39;s a tongue</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.280" end="01:20:56.249" style="s2">and with dicks thing its behavior in</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.249" end="01:21:02.820" style="s2">this thing is actually at a molecular</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.829" end="01:21:03.690" style="s2">level yeah and it couldn&#39;t be more</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.820" end="01:21:06.809" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.690" end="01:21:08.159" style="s2">if mice are going to be the major system</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.809" end="01:21:10.079" style="s2">in which we are going to test drugs</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.159" end="01:21:13.949" style="s2">which are highly sensitive to what</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.079" end="01:21:16.230" style="s2">histological repair yep it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="01:21:16.230" end="01:21:21.780" style="s2">that I&#39;m super energized about getting</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.409" end="01:21:24.690" style="s2">this into the world I&#39;m it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.780" end="01:21:27.360" style="s2">transformative dick looks at the paper</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.690" end="01:21:28.440" style="s2">he says this is fantastic he puts me</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.360" end="01:21:31.920" style="s2">through the wringer to get it really</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.440" end="01:21:36.329" style="s2">tight we get it tight we send it to</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.920" end="01:21:37.559" style="s2">George Williams the the but number one</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.329" end="01:21:39.690" style="s2">guy in the world and number one</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.690" end="01:21:45.079" style="s2">in the world and he writes a beautiful</p>

<p begin="01:21:45.079" end="01:21:49.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to send it to nature George</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.670" end="01:21:53.999" style="s2">Williams tells nature you need to take</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.980" end="01:21:58.499" style="s2">this piece very seriously we send it to</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.999" end="01:22:01.670" style="s2">nature and they send it back with one of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.499" end="01:22:05.130" style="s2">their absurd form letters that says that</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.670" end="01:22:07.199" style="s2">the nature of the article is such that</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.130" end="01:22:09.749" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not a limited interest to</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.199" end="01:22:11.159" style="s2">their readers and we&#39;re you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.749" end="01:22:12.920" style="s2">we had a good laugh about that you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.159" end="01:22:18.329" style="s2">it&#39;s cancer it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.920" end="01:22:21.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so bad like this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.329" end="01:22:24.300" style="s2">a response that indicates either</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.530" end="01:22:27.539" style="s2">malfeasance or analyze a program to or</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.300" end="01:22:29.820" style="s2">or the the janitor ended up responding</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.539" end="01:22:31.170" style="s2">who didn&#39;t know anybody it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.820" end="01:22:33.150" style="s2">craziest thing and you know the cherry</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.170" end="01:22:35.849" style="s2">on top is that they&#39;re turning down</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.150" end="01:22:38.309" style="s2">George Williams recommendation like how</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.849" end="01:22:40.949" style="s2">great do they know who he is like what</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.309" end="01:22:43.440" style="s2">were in what on what plan on what planet</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.949" end="01:22:45.170" style="s2">do you turn down his recommendation to</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.440" end="01:22:52.440" style="s2">look at something about senescence so</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.170" end="01:22:54.809" style="s2">anyway I get back this rejection and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.440" end="01:22:58.650" style="s2">have purposefully not shown Carol</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.809" end="01:23:01.619" style="s2">Greider the paper in preparation which I</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.650" end="01:23:03.389" style="s2">am afraid she might have read some way</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.619" end="01:23:05.840" style="s2">the reason I didn&#39;t show it to her was</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.389" end="01:23:08.190" style="s2">because I wanted to preserve her</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.840" end="01:23:10.650" style="s2">independence as a reviewer for the paper</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.190" end="01:23:12.989" style="s2">I was hoping because I still thought she</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.650" end="01:23:14.969" style="s2">was an ally of mine I was hoping that</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.989" end="01:23:17.630" style="s2">nature would send it to her to review</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.969" end="01:23:20.429" style="s2">and that she would look favorably on it</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.630" end="01:23:22.380" style="s2">especially since it was you know very</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.429" end="01:23:25.559" style="s2">clear that she&#39;s unsure was her lab</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.380" end="01:23:29.579" style="s2">right it was made the confirmation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.559" end="01:23:31.139" style="s2">and I another thing I forgot I asked her</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.579" end="01:23:33.780" style="s2">at some point something that now rings</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.139" end="01:23:37.829" style="s2">in my ears I asked her Carol you&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.780" end="01:23:40.800" style="s2">got this result about no actually lab</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.829" end="01:23:42.780" style="s2">lab mice have long tumors but wild mice</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.800" end="01:23:44.459" style="s2">have short telomeres that&#39;s a big result</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.780" end="01:23:46.590" style="s2">a hell of a delta where are you gonna</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.459" end="01:23:48.420" style="s2">publish it so that I can cite it my</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.590" end="01:23:50.699" style="s2">paper which is the natural thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.420" end="01:23:52.820" style="s2">and she says we&#39;re not going to publish</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.699" end="01:23:57.719" style="s2">it we&#39;re going to keep the information</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.820" end="01:23:59.670" style="s2">in-house that was her phrase I was too</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.719" end="01:24:01.440" style="s2">young to understand what the hell she</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.670" end="01:24:03.510" style="s2">was talking I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;m 54 I</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.440" end="01:24:06.840" style="s2">don&#39;t quite understand it myself well</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.510" end="01:24:10.709" style="s2">it&#39;s so heartbreaking what she has</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.840" end="01:24:13.050" style="s2">effectively done is decided I could</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.709" end="01:24:15.269" style="s2">publish this result then everyone would</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.050" end="01:24:17.099" style="s2">have huge but then I&#39;m on a level</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.269" end="01:24:19.229" style="s2">playing field with everybody else if I</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.099" end="01:24:22.469" style="s2">don&#39;t publish this result I have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.229" end="01:24:25.530" style="s2">stream of papers I can get it then I can</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.469" end="01:24:26.130" style="s2">start predicting other results nobody</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.530" end="01:24:28.050" style="s2">will know</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.130" end="01:24:31.650" style="s2">how I am doing that thing I will look</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.050" end="01:24:36.000" style="s2">like a super genius and so holding it in</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.650" end="01:24:39.090" style="s2">house is a mechanism for a whole slew</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.000" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">lepape to be to be 100 you can afford to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.090" end="01:24:43.760" style="s2">bend over backwards and not make</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.800" end="01:24:46.409" style="s2">inferences let&#39;s say the following</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.760" end="01:24:50.460" style="s2">holding it in house is in a seemingly</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.409" end="01:24:54.360" style="s2">inexplicable decision in science but for</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.460" end="01:24:56.520" style="s2">for the fact that it fits at least one</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.360" end="01:25:00.030" style="s2">story of this kind which is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.520" end="01:25:04.320" style="s2">consistent with wishing to publish a</p>

<p begin="01:25:06.300" end="01:25:12.300" style="s2">can either do one discovery or you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.460" end="01:25:13.949" style="s2">do a stream of predictions and that</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.300" end="01:25:18.889" style="s2">makes a certain amount of sense given</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.949" end="01:25:22.739" style="s2">the ruthlessly competitive grant winning</p>

<p begin="01:25:32.389" end="01:25:38.550" style="s2">because in part of what&#39;s on the line</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.620" end="01:25:40.290" style="s2">right so I mean this is not just a</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.550" end="01:25:43.670" style="s2">question of academic interest you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.290" end="01:25:46.530" style="s2">because these mice are used for medical</p>

<p begin="01:25:46.530" end="01:25:52.949" style="s2">testing but it&#39;s also all of the science</p>

<p begin="01:28:44.980" end="01:28:50.550" style="s2">experimental gerontology they send it</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.370" end="01:28:52.870" style="s2">out for review as you know review is</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.550" end="01:28:56.140" style="s2">blind you don&#39;t know who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.870" end="01:29:03.670" style="s2">viewers are but you can often tell who</p>

<p begin="01:29:07.720" end="01:29:11.290" style="s2">I have to thank her in the paper for the</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.130" end="01:29:13.420" style="s2">work she did but I&#39;m now on alert that</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.290" end="01:29:16.180" style="s2">she&#39;s gone strange on the subject matter</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.420" end="01:29:18.460" style="s2">of this paper and so I&#39;ve broken her out</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.180" end="01:29:20.140" style="s2">separately in the acknowledgments I</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.460" end="01:29:23.020" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be as gracious to her</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.140" end="01:29:24.370" style="s2">because she&#39;s being hostile to me right</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.020" end="01:29:27.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to not acknowledge her so I</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.370" end="01:29:31.960" style="s2">acknowledge her separately experimental</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.790" end="01:29:37.140" style="s2">gerontology then I am 99% sure sends the</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.960" end="01:29:40.480" style="s2">paper to her as the reviewer she pans it</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.140" end="01:29:43.780" style="s2">absolutely brutal critiques just pages</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.480" end="01:29:46.030" style="s2">and pages and pages of them they are not</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.780" end="01:29:47.860" style="s2">high-quality critiques I could go</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.030" end="01:29:50.020" style="s2">through every single one don&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.860" end="01:29:51.910" style="s2">this is a podcast just know I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.020" end="01:29:53.800" style="s2">it here but I could have that no but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.910" end="01:29:56.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what to do because she was</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.800" end="01:29:58.270" style="s2">in line for a Nobel Prize that was well</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.290" end="01:29:59.800" style="s2">understood I didn&#39;t want to accuse a</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.270" end="01:30:01.600" style="s2">leading light of the field of them okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.800" end="01:30:04.090" style="s2">this is exactly where I got angry at the</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.600" end="01:30:06.400" style="s2">beginning of the podcast you moron no no</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.090" end="01:30:09.640" style="s2">offense you were in line for a Nobel</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.400" end="01:30:11.650" style="s2">Prize you didn&#39;t I mean I&#39;m sorry there</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.640" end="01:30:13.450" style="s2">is an aspect of this about giving away</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.650" end="01:30:15.190" style="s2">your power even though you&#39;ve even</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.450" end="01:30:17.410" style="s2">acumen just you don&#39;t even have a PhD</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.190" end="01:30:19.210" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying at the time if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.410" end="01:30:21.190" style="s2">mentioned her name yeah I would say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.210" end="01:30:21.700" style="s2">her Nobel Prizes one of these years</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.190" end="01:30:24.070" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.700" end="01:30:25.480" style="s2">so my point was I was in the awkward</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.070" end="01:30:27.640" style="s2">position I didn&#39;t understand what I was</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.480" end="01:30:29.530" style="s2">supposed to do I didn&#39;t want to send</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.640" end="01:30:30.970" style="s2">back a review that said I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.530" end="01:30:32.890" style="s2">the person is who reviewed this but they</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.970" end="01:30:34.960" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the material and all of</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.890" end="01:30:36.220" style="s2">their critiques suck because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.960" end="01:30:38.140" style="s2">want to accuse somebody who was that</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.220" end="01:30:40.870" style="s2">powerful of not getting it here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.140" end="01:30:44.380" style="s2">problem what do you do you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.870" end="01:30:46.180" style="s2">actually have evidence in the hard right</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.380" end="01:30:48.220" style="s2">form where like you have got videotape</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.180" end="01:30:50.260" style="s2">but on the other hand these are small</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.220" end="01:30:54.040" style="s2">worlds this all of this is preposterous</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.260" end="01:30:56.320" style="s2">right so I sit on the review for too</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.040" end="01:30:58.450" style="s2">long not knowing what you don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.320" end="01:31:01.150" style="s2">to I don&#39;t know how to handle I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.450" end="01:31:03.730" style="s2">but like I have no advisor your advisor</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.150" end="01:31:04.960" style="s2">was not equipped for the modern era he</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.730" end="01:31:05.220" style="s2">wasn&#39;t equipped for the modern era he</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.960" end="01:31:07.050" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.220" end="01:31:11.640" style="s2">Equipe for molecular biology that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.050" end="01:31:14.760" style="s2">I finally settle on a strategy that I</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.640" end="01:31:18.560" style="s2">can live with and I send back a note I</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.760" end="01:31:23.160" style="s2">send back the review and my note says I</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.560" end="01:31:25.530" style="s2">don&#39;t know why but the this entire list</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.160" end="01:31:27.630" style="s2">of critiques is not high quality if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.530" end="01:31:29.790" style="s2">would like to point me to any of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.630" end="01:31:31.740" style="s2">critiques in this list that you would</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.790" end="01:31:34.410" style="s2">like me to address I am more than happy</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.740" end="01:31:37.200" style="s2">to do it but I don&#39;t think it makes</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.410" end="01:31:40.640" style="s2">sense to address the entire list and as</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.200" end="01:31:44.670" style="s2">I recall it I hit Send on the email and</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.640" end="01:31:49.320" style="s2">within minutes maybe it was an hour I</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.670" end="01:31:52.380" style="s2">got back a response your paper has been</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.320" end="01:31:54.120" style="s2">accepted for publication which blew me</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.380" end="01:31:56.190" style="s2">away because no sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.120" end="01:31:59.460" style="s2">according to regular protocol right it</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.190" end="01:32:00.780" style="s2">makes no sense because clearly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.460" end="01:32:01.950" style="s2">supposed to send it out for review the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.780" end="01:32:03.090" style="s2">review were supposed to say whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.950" end="01:32:04.650" style="s2">supposed to get published if you were</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.090" end="01:32:06.570" style="s2">said it shouldn&#39;t be published I said I</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.650" end="01:32:08.340" style="s2">refuse to address these critiques unless</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.570" end="01:32:11.040" style="s2">you ask me to the editors have</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.340" end="01:32:13.590" style="s2">overridden the reviewer they understood</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.040" end="01:32:16.230" style="s2">the reviews were cruddy they needed me</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.590" end="01:32:17.490" style="s2">to say that in order to justify the move</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.230" end="01:32:19.860" style="s2">that they wanted to make they knew the</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.490" end="01:32:23.580" style="s2">paper was good and the review was crap</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.860" end="01:32:26.010" style="s2">so they effectively overrode normal peer</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.580" end="01:32:27.900" style="s2">review was my paper peer reviewed well</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.010" end="01:32:30.720" style="s2">it was by the editors who were experts</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.900" end="01:32:33.750" style="s2">but let me jump in peer review is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.720" end="01:32:37.070" style="s2">cancer from outer space it came from the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.750" end="01:32:40.440" style="s2">biomedical community it invaded science</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.070" end="01:32:42.120" style="s2">the old system because I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.440" end="01:32:44.070" style="s2">this because many people who are now</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.120" end="01:32:45.960" style="s2">professional scientists have an idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.070" end="01:32:47.900" style="s2">that peer review has always been in our</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.960" end="01:32:51.540" style="s2">literature and it absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.900" end="01:32:54.540" style="s2">motherfucking has not right okay it used</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.540" end="01:32:56.400" style="s2">to be that the editor of a journal took</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.540" end="01:32:58.200" style="s2">responsibility for the quality of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.400" end="01:33:00.120" style="s2">journal which is why we had things like</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.200" end="01:33:02.390" style="s2">nature crop up in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.120" end="01:33:05.460" style="s2">because they had courageous</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.390" end="01:33:07.800" style="s2">knowledgeable forward-thinking editors</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.460" end="01:33:10.380" style="s2">and so I just want to be very clear</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.800" end="01:33:12.060" style="s2">because there is a mind virus out there</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.380" end="01:33:14.070" style="s2">that says peer review is the cinah qua</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.060" end="01:33:16.200" style="s2">non of scientific excellence yada yada</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.070" end="01:33:18.050" style="s2">yada bullshit bullshit bullshit and if</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.200" end="01:33:20.780" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe me go back and</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.050" end="01:33:24.050" style="s2">learn that this is a recent invasive</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.780" end="01:33:27.260" style="s2">problem in the sciences recent invasive</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.050" end="01:33:29.150" style="s2">problem that has no justification for</p>

<p begin="01:33:29.150" end="01:33:34.670" style="s2">does it have no justification for</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.500" end="01:33:36.170" style="s2">existing when Watson and Crick did the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.670" end="01:33:38.780" style="s2">double helix and this is the cleanest</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.170" end="01:33:40.940" style="s2">example we have the paper was agreed</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.780" end="01:33:43.309" style="s2">should not be sent out for review</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.940" end="01:33:45.020" style="s2">because anyone who was competent would</p>

<p begin="01:33:45.020" end="01:33:50.179" style="s2">implications were there are reasons that</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.389" end="01:33:52.940" style="s2">great work cannot be peer-reviewed</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.179" end="01:33:54.469" style="s2">furthermore you have entire fields that</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.940" end="01:33:56.809" style="s2">are existing now with electronic</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.469" end="01:33:59.780" style="s2">archives that are not peer reviewed peer</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.809" end="01:34:02.210" style="s2">review is not peer review it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.780" end="01:34:05.510" style="s2">peer review it is peer injunction it is</p>

<p begin="01:34:19.579" end="01:34:25.280" style="s2">so the paper was accepted by</p>

<p begin="01:34:39.380" end="01:34:43.610" style="s2">original submission was called life slow</p>

<p begin="01:34:43.610" end="01:34:47.960" style="s2">that amoris all right then</p>

<p begin="01:34:52.340" end="01:34:57.619" style="s2">catchy title but nonetheless the paper</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.510" end="01:35:00.920" style="s2">I&#39;m very proud of how it&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.619" end="01:35:04.219" style="s2">people read it who were not expert could</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.920" end="01:35:08.659" style="s2">understand it the abstract is extremely</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.219" end="01:35:11.420" style="s2">clear and it ends with the clear point</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.659" end="01:35:14.030" style="s2">that because we have unearthed we have</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.420" end="01:35:16.730" style="s2">predicted and Carol Greider has shown</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.030" end="01:35:18.559" style="s2">that wild mice telomeres are short and</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.730" end="01:35:22.730" style="s2">that telomeres have been elongated by</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.559" end="01:35:25.309" style="s2">captivity that there is a clear danger</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.730" end="01:35:29.690" style="s2">that the mice we are using for drug</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.309" end="01:35:31.219" style="s2">safety testing are biased in an</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.690" end="01:35:33.739" style="s2">egregious way and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.219" end="01:35:35.869" style="s2">bias would look like this a mouse that</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.739" end="01:35:38.360" style="s2">has very long telomeres has an</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.869" end="01:35:42.039" style="s2">indefinitely large capacity to replace</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.360" end="01:35:45.949" style="s2">damaged tissue and it has a</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.039" end="01:35:49.010" style="s2">vulnerability to cancer that is</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.949" end="01:35:50.780" style="s2">preternatural &#39;high so we may be</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.010" end="01:35:53.150" style="s2">overrating if we use these - we may be</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.780" end="01:35:57.229" style="s2">overrating the danger of causing cancer</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.150" end="01:35:59.389" style="s2">and vastly underrated the danger of tuck</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.229" end="01:36:02.929" style="s2">cytotoxicity and in fact one of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.389" end="01:36:04.820" style="s2">things so the point was you give a mouse</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.929" end="01:36:07.309" style="s2">who&#39;s got a effectively infinite</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.820" end="01:36:09.380" style="s2">capacity to replace its tissues a toxin</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.309" end="01:36:11.119" style="s2">and either the toxin is so deadly that</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.380" end="01:36:15.159" style="s2">it dies right away but if it doesn&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.119" end="01:36:17.960" style="s2">right away it just eats up the insult</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.159" end="01:36:20.150" style="s2">so those animals would lead us to</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.960" end="01:36:22.130" style="s2">release drugs by insult what you mean is</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.150" end="01:36:25.400" style="s2">so they&#39;re in across the damage yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.130" end="01:36:27.679" style="s2">yeah what this would cause us to do is</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.400" end="01:36:30.079" style="s2">release drugs onto the market for human</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.679" end="01:36:35.599" style="s2">use that are highly toxic across the</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.079" end="01:36:38.869" style="s2">body and if if the mice if the mouse</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.599" end="01:36:40.729" style="s2">standard was the last standard well no</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.869" end="01:36:44.300" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not the last standard</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.729" end="01:36:47.239" style="s2">because to say this the problem is I</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.300" end="01:36:49.969" style="s2">mean you you can imagine how hard it is</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.239" end="01:36:52.940" style="s2">to test on large slowly reproducing</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.969" end="01:36:55.519" style="s2">animals what so FX of testing on humans</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.940" end="01:36:58.070" style="s2">is very absolutely restricted so my</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.519" end="01:37:00.800" style="s2">handle is the last cheap place it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.070" end="01:37:03.019" style="s2">last place large end data not only large</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.800" end="01:37:07.039" style="s2">n but it&#39;s the one place that you can</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.019" end="01:37:10.179" style="s2">make the following move you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.039" end="01:37:11.360" style="s2">that in many circumstances the</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.179" end="01:37:14.090" style="s2">accelerated</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.360" end="01:37:17.030" style="s2">lifespan the accelerated life cycle of</p>

<p begin="01:37:17.030" end="01:37:20.749" style="s2">as it would accrue in humans on a very</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.889" end="01:37:22.099" style="s2">short timescale that doesn&#39;t work with</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.749" end="01:37:26.059" style="s2">monkeys it doesn&#39;t work with human</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.099" end="01:37:28.729" style="s2">patients it works with mice maybe but in</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.059" end="01:37:31.400" style="s2">the case of mice with ultra long</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.729" end="01:37:33.710" style="s2">telomeres those insults will be</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.400" end="01:37:35.150" style="s2">invisible well let&#39;s just I want to back</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.710" end="01:37:36.590" style="s2">up because I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.150" end="01:37:39.110" style="s2">important part of the story what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.590" end="01:37:41.809" style="s2">saying is if you take an organism that</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.110" end="01:37:45.320" style="s2">has an expected let&#39;s say 40 year</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.809" end="01:37:49.340" style="s2">lifetime it&#39;s very expensive</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.320" end="01:37:53.780" style="s2">of timewise to say we ran this</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.340" end="01:37:56.260" style="s2">experiment and found that there was no</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.780" end="01:37:58.520" style="s2">immediate damage that was visible but</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.260" end="01:38:00.590" style="s2">towards the very end of their lives we</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.520" end="01:38:02.420" style="s2">saw a market increase in morbidity earth</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.590" end="01:38:04.730" style="s2">yeah I mean if you took a drug and it</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.420" end="01:38:07.280" style="s2">knocked fifteen years off your life on</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.730" end="01:38:09.500" style="s2">average that might not show up in any</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.280" end="01:38:11.810" style="s2">notable way in a short term study</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.500" end="01:38:13.310" style="s2">pressure - right and nobody is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.810" end="01:38:16.760" style="s2">want to let drugs you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.310" end="01:38:18.380" style="s2">want to wait 4050 years to find out what</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.760" end="01:38:21.139" style="s2">happens to these patients so what we do</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.380" end="01:38:23.300" style="s2">is we make the assumption that if we</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.139" end="01:38:25.340" style="s2">give large amounts of a drug to an</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.300" end="01:38:27.199" style="s2">animal that lives a very short life we</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.340" end="01:38:28.610" style="s2">will see those effects early and if the</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.199" end="01:38:30.199" style="s2">animal happens to have ultra long</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.610" end="01:38:33.679" style="s2">telomeres you won&#39;t see those effects</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.199" end="01:38:35.389" style="s2">early so it&#39;s a perfect storm for</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.679" end="01:38:37.550" style="s2">causing us to release drugs that should</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.389" end="01:38:40.670" style="s2">never have been released into public can</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.550" end="01:38:44.980" style="s2">you think oh I sure can Vioxx for</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.670" end="01:38:48.050" style="s2">example so Vioxx was discovered to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.980" end="01:38:49.730" style="s2">heart damage right heart damage how do</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.050" end="01:38:51.889" style="s2">you why do we know that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.730" end="01:38:54.619" style="s2">know - well the thing about hearts a</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.889" end="01:38:57.110" style="s2">hearts for reasons we can get into maybe</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.619" end="01:39:00.380" style="s2">another time hearts have a very low</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.110" end="01:39:02.300" style="s2">capacity for self repair right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.380" end="01:39:04.429" style="s2">why they&#39;re fun or much turnover not</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.300" end="01:39:06.590" style="s2">much capacity for repair not much</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.429" end="01:39:11.449" style="s2">turnover now there&#39;s an adaptive reason</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.590" end="01:39:13.329" style="s2">for that but but hearts don&#39;t repair</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.449" end="01:39:16.369" style="s2">themselves very well in a healthy person</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.329" end="01:39:18.829" style="s2">and when they fail it&#39;s hard to ignore</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.369" end="01:39:21.679" style="s2">right if somebody who&#39;s 30 has their</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.829" end="01:39:24.650" style="s2">heart fail there&#39;s questions asked right</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.679" end="01:39:26.630" style="s2">so anyway Vioxx was released into the</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.650" end="01:39:28.130" style="s2">public having passed drug safety yes</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.630" end="01:39:30.020" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the only system that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.130" end="01:39:33.230" style="s2">have a lot of mitosis</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.020" end="01:39:36.909" style="s2">like for example neurons neurons don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.230" end="01:39:39.980" style="s2">have a lot cartilage doesn&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.909" end="01:39:41.810" style="s2">your eye cells don&#39;t now note all of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.980" end="01:39:44.119" style="s2">tissues I&#39;ve just mentioned the last</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.810" end="01:39:46.610" style="s2">time you heard about anybody having you</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.119" end="01:39:48.590" style="s2">know cancer of the cartilage of their</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.610" end="01:39:50.690" style="s2">knee cancer of the heart no think of</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.590" end="01:39:52.790" style="s2">brain cancer tends to be glial glial</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.690" end="01:39:55.579" style="s2">cells exactly so the tissues at a very</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.790" end="01:39:57.230" style="s2">low capacity for self repair right do</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.579" end="01:39:58.800" style="s2">tend to wear out and they don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.230" end="01:40:03.920" style="s2">get cancer which is exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.800" end="01:40:06.809" style="s2">predictions of my paper right okay so</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.920" end="01:40:08.219" style="s2">Vioxx is known to do heart damage that</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.809" end="01:40:09.420" style="s2">created a big scandal because how the</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.219" end="01:40:11.489" style="s2">hell did it get through drug safety</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.420" end="01:40:14.929" style="s2">testing turns out a lot of drugs have</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.489" end="01:40:17.670" style="s2">done this we&#39;ve seen it Gleevec fen phen</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.929" end="01:40:18.840" style="s2">erythromycin your doctor probably still</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.670" end="01:40:21.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know their way through my son</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.840" end="01:40:23.309" style="s2">does heart damage right there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.030" end="01:40:25.440" style="s2">these cases of drugs that were released</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.309" end="01:40:26.969" style="s2">and then later understood to do heart</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.440" end="01:40:28.710" style="s2">damage now my claim is they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.969" end="01:40:30.570" style="s2">actually do heart damage they do</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.710" end="01:40:33.929" style="s2">cellular damage and they are gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.570" end="01:40:35.820" style="s2">only saying you yeah yeah yeah Jesus is</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.929" end="01:40:38.429" style="s2">like another layer of this thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.820" end="01:40:40.710" style="s2">like a huge fucking nightmare right</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.429" end="01:40:43.679" style="s2">because but it&#39;s this thing about like</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.710" end="01:40:46.320" style="s2">perseverance and disagree ability you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.679" end="01:40:48.239" style="s2">got all sorts of things that sound like</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.320" end="01:40:50.520" style="s2">something that invalidates the theory</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.239" end="01:40:53.040" style="s2">and then it sort of theories upon</p>

<p begin="01:40:53.040" end="01:40:56.969" style="s2">original simplicity of the idea I see</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.869" end="01:40:59.550" style="s2">the original idea is very simple yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.969" end="01:41:01.679" style="s2">but if you know a lot of like weird</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.550" end="01:41:03.809" style="s2">facts about what you think are just mice</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.679" end="01:41:07.800" style="s2">or something about hearts</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.809" end="01:41:10.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t put together what is going on</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.800" end="01:41:11.579" style="s2">the idea that the ambient damage is only</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.079" end="01:41:14.670" style="s2">manifest in the heart because that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:41:14.670" end="01:41:19.710" style="s2">that like really doesn&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.679" end="01:41:22.020" style="s2">mitosis so well piece of advice to</p>

<p begin="01:41:22.020" end="01:41:28.590" style="s2">similar waters mmm-hmm the signal that</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.980" end="01:41:31.230" style="s2">you are on the right track is that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.590" end="01:41:33.000" style="s2">starts canceling complexity in the story</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.230" end="01:41:35.369" style="s2">which has accumulated because something</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.000" end="01:41:37.739" style="s2">was missing it&#39;s disappearing and okay</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.369" end="01:41:40.170" style="s2">you you begin to take on a model anyway</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.739" end="01:41:41.550" style="s2">so yes we&#39;ve got a situation where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.170" end="01:41:44.400" style="s2">got a bunch of drugs mysteriously</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.550" end="01:41:45.780" style="s2">producing damage so they&#39;ve got a paper</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.400" end="01:41:49.829" style="s2">that&#39;s out you&#39;ve got a real-world</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.780" end="01:41:51.570" style="s2">application you&#39;ve got an a theory</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.829" end="01:41:53.719" style="s2">coming out of evolutionary theory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.570" end="01:41:56.190" style="s2">making a molecular prediction yep</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.719" end="01:41:58.170" style="s2">successfully predicts Mouse telomeres</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.190" end="01:42:00.750" style="s2">one of the world&#39;s leading labs has</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.170" end="01:42:02.429" style="s2">confirmed the prediction yeah where are</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.750" end="01:42:05.369" style="s2">we now what will you wait year is half</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.429" end="01:42:06.989" style="s2">God well let&#39;s see the paper came out in</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.369" end="01:42:09.360" style="s2">my recollection and to just to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.989" end="01:42:11.670" style="s2">horrible about this is that your fucking</p>

<p begin="01:42:11.670" end="01:42:16.590" style="s2">which has some great people is also</p>

<p begin="01:42:23.310" end="01:42:28.500" style="s2">nobel quality work at least one or two</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.489" end="01:42:29.880" style="s2">times over in my opinion I could be</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.500" end="01:42:33.570" style="s2">wrong and biased because of your brother</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.880" end="01:42:36.449" style="s2">I&#39;m your brother but what concerns me</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.570" end="01:42:39.989" style="s2">here is is that you are not comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.449" end="01:42:42.600" style="s2">with what this story really might be no</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.989" end="01:42:45.420" style="s2">I&#39;m look it&#39;s not my not mine to judge</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.600" end="01:42:47.040" style="s2">I&#39;m very proud of this work and yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.420" end="01:42:51.810" style="s2">the problem bread is is the Jerry Coyne</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.040" end="01:42:54.239" style="s2">and Richard Dawkins did not know the</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.810" end="01:42:56.910" style="s2">dick Alexander Leonard hayflick and</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.239" end="01:42:58.770" style="s2">George Williams yeah we&#39;re all on this</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.910" end="01:43:00.719" style="s2">thing because that community had broken</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.770" end="01:43:02.699" style="s2">down you know the irony is I sent a</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.719" end="01:43:05.280" style="s2">letter to Dawkins when this was going on</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.699" end="01:43:08.310" style="s2">asking for his help and he sent back a</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.280" end="01:43:10.800" style="s2">letter saying this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.310" end="01:43:14.699" style="s2">it&#39;s not my area of specialty you should</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.800" end="01:43:16.560" style="s2">talk to Bill Hamilton and I was in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.699" end="01:43:21.270" style="s2">process of writing a letter to Bill</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.560" end="01:43:24.650" style="s2">Hamilton on on Dawkins suggestion at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.270" end="01:43:28.650" style="s2">point that Bill Hamilton came back from</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.650" end="01:43:30.750" style="s2">Africa having he was pursuing a remote</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.650" end="01:43:32.580" style="s2">hypothesis about humans having</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.750" end="01:43:38.790" style="s2">accidentally unleashed aids into the</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.580" end="01:43:40.890" style="s2">world with polio vaccine but anyway Bill</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.790" end="01:43:42.210" style="s2">Hamilton I&#39;m sorry just not everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.890" end="01:43:45.360" style="s2">gonna know this is a guy who came up</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.210" end="01:43:47.969" style="s2">with inclusive fitness yes he was one of</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.360" end="01:43:51.239" style="s2">the great geniuses of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.969" end="01:43:54.030" style="s2">biology in the late 20th century he was</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.239" end="01:43:56.610" style="s2">held back by John Maynard right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.030" end="01:43:58.710" style="s2">know that story I you know the Maynard</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.610" end="01:44:01.080" style="s2">is interviewed on web of stories we made</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.710" end="01:44:04.440" style="s2">under Smith yes sorry yeah Maynard Smith</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.080" end="01:44:06.390" style="s2">that right yeah and Maynard Smith talks</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.440" end="01:44:08.280" style="s2">about like you know it was very</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.390" end="01:44:10.199" style="s2">unfortunate I didn&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.280" end="01:44:11.880" style="s2">who he was you should check it out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.199" end="01:44:14.400" style="s2">pretty amazing well as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.880" end="01:44:17.370" style="s2">doing this yeah years after this story</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.400" end="01:44:20.460" style="s2">had cooled yeah I ran across a paper</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.370" end="01:44:22.949" style="s2">from John Maynard Smith that I now don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.460" end="01:44:24.780" style="s2">remember exactly what its nature was but</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.949" end="01:44:28.020" style="s2">it appeared to predict</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.780" end="01:44:29.429" style="s2">my whole story uh-huh right and John</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.020" end="01:44:31.980" style="s2">Maynard Smith was dead I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.429" end="01:44:36.260" style="s2">contact him I really wanted to say oh my</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.980" end="01:44:39.300" style="s2">god you nailed it right but anyway um so</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.260" end="01:44:42.030" style="s2">I was in the process of writing to Bill</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.300" end="01:44:44.460" style="s2">Hamilton to get his help you know he was</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.030" end="01:44:48.239" style="s2">sort of on a par with George Williams</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.460" end="01:44:49.889" style="s2">and he went into a coma on his trip back</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.239" end="01:44:51.780" style="s2">from Africa having contracted malaria</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.889" end="01:44:53.550" style="s2">and then there was I think complication</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.780" end="01:44:55.409" style="s2">with the aspirin that he took or</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.550" end="01:44:59.039" style="s2">something and he never woke from his</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.409" end="01:45:01.170" style="s2">coma and he died tragically so he never</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.039" end="01:45:03.750" style="s2">got the letter and who knows what he</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.170" end="01:45:06.530" style="s2">would have done okay that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.750" end="01:45:08.699" style="s2">a tragic and interesting story but</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.530" end="01:45:10.679" style="s2">hayflick was positive towards you</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.699" end="01:45:13.079" style="s2">Williams was positive towards you and</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.679" end="01:45:14.969" style="s2">dick Alexander those were the three that</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.079" end="01:45:16.770" style="s2">blew me away that&#39;s a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.969" end="01:45:19.079" style="s2">force a lot of firepower and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.770" end="01:45:21.270" style="s2">enough but here&#39;s the punchline to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.079" end="01:45:24.210" style="s2">story effectively at the point that my</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.270" end="01:45:27.059" style="s2">paper is out right and it very directly</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.210" end="01:45:28.440" style="s2">alleges the danger with yeah these drugs</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.059" end="01:45:30.179" style="s2">being released when they&#39;re not safe and</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.440" end="01:45:31.800" style="s2">the drugs have started emerging and</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.179" end="01:45:33.750" style="s2">turning out now you say and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.800" end="01:45:35.969" style="s2">government is now really interested okay</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.750" end="01:45:40.289" style="s2">and what&#39;s going on the government puts</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.969" end="01:45:43.860" style="s2">together a FDA Commission to study the</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.289" end="01:45:45.449" style="s2">question of the book that they put out</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.860" end="01:45:46.559" style="s2">literally a book that they put out at</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.449" end="01:45:49.050" style="s2">the end of their study is called the</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.559" end="01:45:54.270" style="s2">future of drug safety it opens a</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.050" end="01:45:56.369" style="s2">blue-ribbon panel it it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.270" end="01:45:58.170" style="s2">clear what it was what is clear is that</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.369" end="01:46:01.460" style="s2">you can search the manuscript of this</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.170" end="01:46:03.360" style="s2">book nowhere does it mention Mouse</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.460" end="01:46:05.159" style="s2">antagonist it doesn&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.360" end="01:46:07.520" style="s2">antagonistic pleiotropy it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.159" end="01:46:12.389" style="s2">mention the genus mus it doesn&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.520" end="01:46:14.699" style="s2">telomeres it&#39;s not in there it&#39;s alleged</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.389" end="01:46:16.469" style="s2">in the literature in broad daylight that</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.699" end="01:46:18.809" style="s2">this is what is causing this yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.469" end="01:46:20.820" style="s2">well that now you&#39;re see this is the</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.809" end="01:46:24.119" style="s2">vampire effect where you don&#39;t exist if</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.820" end="01:46:26.550" style="s2">nobody reacts right and so I start going</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.119" end="01:46:28.889" style="s2">to members of the press I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.550" end="01:46:31.829" style="s2">a huge goddamn story somebody is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.889" end="01:46:33.599" style="s2">make if promote career on it and I call</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.829" end="01:46:35.820" style="s2">it members of the press and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.599" end="01:46:38.219" style="s2">the same right always the same always</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.820" end="01:46:41.309" style="s2">the same they&#39;re very excited about</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.219" end="01:46:43.440" style="s2">story initially right a reporter the</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.309" end="01:46:46.530" style="s2">reporter is exciting yep and then the</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.440" end="01:46:48.989" style="s2">reporter talks to someone talking to</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.530" end="01:46:53.880" style="s2">someone and then either they stop</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.989" end="01:46:56.389" style="s2">returning your call yes or they say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.880" end="01:46:59.280" style="s2">sorry the story doesn&#39;t hang together</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.389" end="01:47:01.199" style="s2">its again and again and again yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.280" end="01:47:03.929" style="s2">there&#39;s just nothing you can do what I</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.199" end="01:47:05.789" style="s2">said about the the distributed idea</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.929" end="01:47:08.429" style="s2">suppression complex yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.789" end="01:47:10.650" style="s2">and the people who MANET don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.429" end="01:47:12.090" style="s2">what they arm up for most of them they</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.650" end="01:47:13.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know what role they&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.090" end="01:47:15.059" style="s2">with you look you see the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.650" end="01:47:16.380" style="s2">with like string theory because none of</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.059" end="01:47:17.999" style="s2">the reporters are actually string</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.380" end="01:47:20.880" style="s2">theorists so they&#39;re dependent upon this</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.999" end="01:47:23.219" style="s2">you saw this with this woman alleging</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.880" end="01:47:24.960" style="s2">that she had the Epstein story three</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.219" end="01:47:27.630" style="s2">years earlier but that the editors said</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.960" end="01:47:30.960" style="s2">well we might lose access to the baby</p>

<p begin="01:49:16.080" end="01:49:22.140" style="s2">yeah and this is I can vouch that this</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.860" end="01:49:24.000" style="s2">is more or less the order of events as</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.140" end="01:49:26.400" style="s2">it was taking place as we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.000" end="01:49:28.530" style="s2">understand what was happening yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.400" end="01:49:31.290" style="s2">have to go through the final Carol</p>

<p begin="01:49:37.380" end="01:49:45.060" style="s2">tail end make sure you include okay so</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.480" end="01:49:47.940" style="s2">at the point that my relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.060" end="01:49:49.890" style="s2">Carol is changing its tenor and she is</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.940" end="01:49:53.610" style="s2">becoming hostile and I&#39;m not clear on</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.890" end="01:49:56.370" style="s2">what&#39;s going on I contact her and I</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.610" end="01:49:58.380" style="s2">discover through talking to her</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.370" end="01:50:02.310" style="s2">that she and Mike are about to publish</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.380" end="01:50:04.110" style="s2">their paper on the long telomeres of</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.310" end="01:50:07.140" style="s2">laboratory mice so this is the Delta</p>

<p begin="01:50:07.140" end="01:50:10.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.770" end="01:50:13.470" style="s2">and I&#39;m shocked because she&#39;s told me</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.200" end="01:50:15.270" style="s2">they&#39;re keeping an in-house and instead</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.470" end="01:50:17.130" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a paper that there she says</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.270" end="01:50:19.020" style="s2">in final revisions there that day</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.130" end="01:50:20.940" style="s2">submitting their final revisions to</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.020" end="01:50:26.100" style="s2">nucleic acid research with their paper</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.940" end="01:50:29.130" style="s2">and I say Carol can I see the paper and</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.100" end="01:50:32.160" style="s2">she says yes and she sends me a</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.130" end="01:50:34.080" style="s2">manuscript not the preprint of the paper</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.160" end="01:50:37.650" style="s2">he sends me a manuscript of the paper</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.080" end="01:50:39.630" style="s2">no acknowledgments no figures and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.650" end="01:50:41.970" style="s2">contact her and I said can I see the</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.630" end="01:50:44.490" style="s2">acknowledgments and the figures she</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.970" end="01:50:49.040" style="s2">sends them to me and I contact her and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.490" end="01:50:51.930" style="s2">say Carol I&#39;m disturbed</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.040" end="01:50:56.130" style="s2">this was my hypothesis that you were</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.930" end="01:50:58.710" style="s2">testing I should probably be an author</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.130" end="01:51:00.390" style="s2">on this paper but at the very least I</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.710" end="01:51:02.460" style="s2">need to be an acknowledgement in this</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.390" end="01:51:04.440" style="s2">paper so that I can go back and point to</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.460" end="01:51:05.670" style="s2">it and say be changes everything that it</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.440" end="01:51:07.219" style="s2">was a prediction it was</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.670" end="01:51:11.750" style="s2">just something was stumbled upon</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.219" end="01:51:15.179" style="s2">absolutely yeah and her response is I</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.750" end="01:51:18.239" style="s2">have been through my email and I see no</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.179" end="01:51:20.550" style="s2">evidence of the communications you are</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.239" end="01:51:23.400" style="s2">talking about now when I said at the</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.550" end="01:51:26.280" style="s2">beginning that hold her I had called her</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.400" end="01:51:28.590" style="s2">that was my that was my air this is such</p>

<p begin="01:51:28.590" end="01:51:34.170" style="s2">this program yeah but this is such</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.020" end="01:51:36.660" style="s2">fucking academic petty stupid ass</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.170" end="01:51:38.130" style="s2">bullshit this is like none of the great</p>

<p begin="01:51:38.130" end="01:51:43.170" style="s2">great stories of all time maybe and</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.460" end="01:51:49.310" style="s2">human life hangs in the balance</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.170" end="01:51:52.100" style="s2">today right okay so Carol does get</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.310" end="01:51:56.100" style="s2">awarded the Nobel Prize Carol Greider</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.100" end="01:51:58.830" style="s2">Elizabeth Blackburn and Shostak Shostak</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.100" end="01:52:01.380" style="s2">who mentions at the point that the Nobel</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.830" end="01:52:03.390" style="s2">Prize is awarded and he was shocked as</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.380" end="01:52:05.100" style="s2">all hell to get a Nobel Prize because</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.390" end="01:52:08.040" style="s2">his work was so deep in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.100" end="01:52:09.989" style="s2">telomeres that we just didn&#39;t expect it</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.040" end="01:52:13.460" style="s2">and suddenly no I should say I want to</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.989" end="01:52:17.880" style="s2">be very clear yeah all of these people</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.460" end="01:52:20.820" style="s2">have made fantastic noble worthy tell</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.880" end="01:52:22.980" style="s2">discoveries there&#39;s zero allegation that</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.820" end="01:52:25.050" style="s2">these people weren&#39;t deserving no</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.980" end="01:52:27.570" style="s2">absolutely no and they you know Carol</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.050" end="01:52:29.100" style="s2">and Elizabeth got their Nobel Prize for</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.570" end="01:52:32.640" style="s2">the discovery of telomerase which is a</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.100" end="01:52:34.469" style="s2">huge huge progress so anyway I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.640" end="01:52:38.370" style="s2">deny that they were worthy of this prize</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.469" end="01:52:40.770" style="s2">but what Carol Greider does with her</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.370" end="01:52:42.210" style="s2">Nobel lecture right Nobel lecture being</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.770" end="01:52:44.850" style="s2">the biggest lecture a scientist will</p>

<p begin="01:52:48.510" end="01:52:57.150" style="s2">she very oddly has now embraced my</p>

<p begin="01:53:03.810" end="01:53:08.699" style="s2">sense she is now a total convert to the</p>

<p begin="01:53:31.360" end="01:53:41.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s immediately after the Nobel</p>

<p begin="01:53:41.680" end="01:53:47.470" style="s2">thinking is embraced right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.380" end="01:53:49.960" style="s2">more to the Nobel lecture so she spends</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.470" end="01:53:54.190" style="s2">her Nobel lecture on what is admittedly</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.960" end="01:53:57.790" style="s2">a very beautiful presentation of the</p>

<p begin="01:54:54.280" end="01:54:59.140" style="s2">she had run that I had suggested to her</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.230" end="01:55:01.360" style="s2">I said you know things like Carol do you</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.140" end="01:55:02.980" style="s2">have any idea if a cell has many</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.360" end="01:55:04.690" style="s2">different telomere lengths is it the</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.980" end="01:55:06.100" style="s2">shortest telomere that controls how many</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.690" end="01:55:07.840" style="s2">reproduction of the cell can do is she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.100" end="01:55:09.640" style="s2">run that experiment interesting lo and</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.840" end="01:55:12.760" style="s2">behold it&#39;s the shortest telomere it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.640" end="01:55:14.290" style="s2">good guess but anyway so she goes</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.760" end="01:55:16.030" style="s2">through this there&#39;s no mention of me</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.290" end="01:55:19.840" style="s2">there&#39;s no mention of the actual</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.030" end="01:55:22.870" style="s2">implications of the the long telomeres</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.840" end="01:55:27.010" style="s2">for things like science and safety</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.870" end="01:55:29.490" style="s2">testing and all of that and I can&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.010" end="01:55:32.890" style="s2">to raise the issue of the safety</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.490" end="01:55:34.480" style="s2">question with anybody right at best</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.890" end="01:55:36.760" style="s2">I get journalists who are interested</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.480" end="01:55:38.440" style="s2">until they call somebody and the</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.760" end="01:55:41.830" style="s2">somebody&#39;s on the other end I know what</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.440" end="01:55:44.440" style="s2">they say they say everybody knows that</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.830" end="01:55:45.820" style="s2">mice aren&#39;t great models in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.440" end="01:55:48.190" style="s2">a paper out that says something like the</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.820" end="01:55:49.600" style="s2">mice lie it&#39;s not about this issue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.190" end="01:55:52.230" style="s2">just about the fact that mice aren&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.600" end="01:55:55.030" style="s2">perfect match the issue in question</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.230" end="01:55:57.490" style="s2">could be solved it could be addressed</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.030" end="01:55:59.920" style="s2">thoroughly and for all I know</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.490" end="01:56:01.690" style="s2">once the Jack&#39;s lab figured out what</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.920" end="01:56:03.850" style="s2">they were doing for all I know they</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.690" end="01:56:05.260" style="s2">quietly have fixed this and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.850" end="01:56:07.450" style="s2">pride you know I&#39;ve heard that there was</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.260" end="01:56:10.780" style="s2">a private meeting in which they decided</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.450" end="01:56:12.280" style="s2">oh look this is the thing yeah you see</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.780" end="01:56:15.070" style="s2">something like this in statistics</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.280" end="01:56:16.900" style="s2">everybody knows that most distributions</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.070" end="01:56:20.410" style="s2">that are bell-shaped are not normal</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.900" end="01:56:23.140" style="s2">right and on the other hand we all use</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.410" end="01:56:25.270" style="s2">normal distributions and as a result</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.140" end="01:56:25.720" style="s2">there are lots of things that at one</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.270" end="01:56:29.020" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.720" end="01:56:32.020" style="s2">everybody knows yeah but don&#39;t percolate</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.020" end="01:56:34.060" style="s2">down to the important layers in which we</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.020" end="01:56:36.880" style="s2">test things and I don&#39;t know where like</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.060" end="01:56:38.410" style="s2">you and I have never been able to fully</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.880" end="01:56:41.310" style="s2">put together because we&#39;re not molecular</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.410" end="01:56:43.780" style="s2">researchers and I&#39;m not even a biologist</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.310" end="01:56:45.480" style="s2">how important are these results how</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.780" end="01:56:49.810" style="s2">robust are they has there been a change</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.480" end="01:56:52.630" style="s2">this is a quiet world at some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.810" end="01:56:54.190" style="s2">a quiet world but I think what I have</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.630" end="01:56:56.200" style="s2">concluded yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.190" end="01:56:58.450" style="s2">working backwards from the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.200" end="01:57:01.480" style="s2">of the field and how it reacts to this</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.450" end="01:57:05.350" style="s2">problem is that there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.480" end="01:57:07.560" style="s2">amount resting on failing to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.350" end="01:57:10.110" style="s2">the error even though the error was</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.560" end="01:57:13.810" style="s2">obviously an honest error to begin right</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.110" end="01:57:15.190" style="s2">they would rather sweep it under the rug</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.810" end="01:57:17.350" style="s2">I mean imagine you&#39;ve got all these</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.190" end="01:57:18.880" style="s2">knockout mice right these knockout mice</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.350" end="01:57:21.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a major investment in them it</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.880" end="01:57:23.320" style="s2">takes a lot of work to knock a</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.100" end="01:57:27.100" style="s2">particular central you got a single</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.320" end="01:57:29.650" style="s2">point of failure right whose projections</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.100" end="01:57:31.900" style="s2">are tendrils into everything right and</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.650" end="01:57:33.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve got how many careers built on</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.900" end="01:57:35.790" style="s2">papers that are now such this is like a</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.640" end="01:57:38.440" style="s2">neighbor this is like a centralized your</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.790" end="01:57:42.000" style="s2">reproducibility crisis yes it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.440" end="01:57:45.130" style="s2">that bad or worse okay and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.000" end="01:57:46.980" style="s2">what happens if let&#39;s say somebody hears</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.130" end="01:57:49.170" style="s2">this podcast and they</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.980" end="01:57:51.480" style="s2">check into it and they find out lo and</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.170" end="01:57:52.980" style="s2">behold this story is true yeah well now</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.480" end="01:57:55.530" style="s2">the FDA has a problem</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.980" end="01:57:58.140" style="s2">what were we whizzing I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.530" end="01:58:00.330" style="s2">get too far out over our skis we have</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.140" end="01:58:04.550" style="s2">enough listeners that people will get a</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.330" end="01:58:07.260" style="s2">chance to hear an unbelievable story and</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.550" end="01:58:09.900" style="s2">if there are things in the story that</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.260" end="01:58:11.850" style="s2">are not true or misremembered or unkind</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.900" end="01:58:14.250" style="s2">or there been changes or maybe we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.850" end="01:58:17.880" style="s2">really fully understand how the drug</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.250" end="01:58:19.470" style="s2">testing works I&#39;m open and I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.880" end="01:58:22.850" style="s2">very clear and I want this in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.470" end="01:58:26.460" style="s2">podcast I&#39;m open to the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.850" end="01:58:30.750" style="s2">most straightforward implications of the</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.460" end="01:58:34.710" style="s2">story are subject to adjustment however</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.750" end="01:58:37.950" style="s2">having lived the story I can say that</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.710" end="01:58:40.440" style="s2">this was an egregious story at multiple</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.950" end="01:58:43.170" style="s2">points with conflicts between the</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.440" end="01:58:45.570" style="s2">evolutionary community the biomedical</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.170" end="01:58:50.930" style="s2">community the professional publishing</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.570" end="01:58:54.330" style="s2">community this is a terrible story and</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.930" end="01:58:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s also an amazing and beautiful and</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.330" end="01:58:57.960" style="s2">wonderful story you know I felt really</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.400" end="01:59:00.870" style="s2">lousy at the beginning of this podcast</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.960" end="01:59:04.080" style="s2">goading you and prodding you but I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.870" end="01:59:06.240" style="s2">bored of you no offence as the guy who</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.080" end="01:59:09.840" style="s2">stood up to the funny kids at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.240" end="01:59:11.160" style="s2">and you know we know what&#39;s in the heads</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.840" end="01:59:14.310" style="s2">of these people if you&#39;re at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.160" end="01:59:16.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not that good Yeah right and that</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.310" end="01:59:18.570" style="s2">was like this is the I just want to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.920" end="01:59:20.940" style="s2">open about it all right look I I</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.570" end="01:59:24.300" style="s2">appreciate it and I and I&#39;m glad to have</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.940" end="01:59:27.690" style="s2">this story out the story has many</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.300" end="01:59:33.810" style="s2">different layers of meaning I know I</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.690" end="01:59:36.030" style="s2">remember where I was when I finally sat</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.810" end="01:59:38.250" style="s2">down to watch Carroll Grider&#39;s Nobel</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.030" end="01:59:39.660" style="s2">lecture and I had one of the oddest</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.250" end="01:59:43.670" style="s2">experiences of my life</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.660" end="01:59:45.960" style="s2">I was I was actually in a hammock</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.670" end="01:59:49.980" style="s2">watching her lecture watching her</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.960" end="01:59:52.920" style="s2">present my hypothesis without my name</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.980" end="01:59:55.380" style="s2">anywhere on it and then she projects</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.920" end="02:00:00.749" style="s2">this image from her paper with Mike</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.380" end="02:00:02.760" style="s2">Eamon and I was flooded</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.749" end="02:00:05.159" style="s2">with two simultaneous emotions that are</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.760" end="02:00:07.789" style="s2">just completely incompatible right I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.159" end="02:00:11.849" style="s2">never felt anything like it I was</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.789" end="02:00:15.570" style="s2">absolutely elated to see my work</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.849" end="02:00:17.789" style="s2">projected on a no-bail stage right that</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.570" end="02:00:21.539" style="s2">changed me you know I called the horse</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.789" end="02:00:24.860" style="s2">and rider problem no the point of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.539" end="02:00:28.499" style="s2">official complex of science is to knock</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.860" end="02:00:30.929" style="s2">the rider and take the horse where the</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.499" end="02:00:33.210" style="s2">horse is the theory and the rider is the</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.929" end="02:00:37.710" style="s2">attribution well this was it I was</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.210" end="02:00:40.440" style="s2">elated and livid simultaneously and I</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.710" end="02:00:41.729" style="s2">still almost feel what it was almost</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.440" end="02:00:44.219" style="s2">like my body was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.729" end="02:00:49.229" style="s2">1/2 supposed to feel one thing and the</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.219" end="02:00:52.729" style="s2">other feels the other but this story has</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.229" end="02:00:57.690" style="s2">many levels of importance personally it</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.729" end="02:01:01.710" style="s2">gave me the ability i was already as you</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.690" end="02:01:03.389" style="s2">are very good at not being persuaded by</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.710" end="02:01:05.639" style="s2">the fact that everybody else disagrees</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.389" end="02:01:07.800" style="s2">with you that that has an implication</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.639" end="02:01:09.479" style="s2">every great idea starts with a minority</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.800" end="02:01:11.760" style="s2">of one and you have to be able to endure</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.479" end="02:01:15.210" style="s2">bright alone with a great idea in order</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.760" end="02:01:20.190" style="s2">to advance the ball significantly this</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.210" end="02:01:23.550" style="s2">story was so extreme and so clear in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.190" end="02:01:25.979" style="s2">end that it just left</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.550" end="02:01:31.590" style="s2">no doubt and I must say I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.979" end="02:01:33.300" style="s2">young students can arrange to confront</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.590" end="02:01:35.550" style="s2">material so that if they&#39;re really good</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.300" end="02:01:37.199" style="s2">they get a clear demonstration like this</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.550" end="02:01:41.369" style="s2">that they&#39;re really good so they know</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.199" end="02:01:43.440" style="s2">how to keep going I think you&#39;re selfish</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.369" end="02:01:46.079" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean to be horrible about it</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.440" end="02:01:48.749" style="s2">I think that this story is an</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.079" end="02:01:50.280" style="s2">inspiration I&#39;ve lived the story with</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.749" end="02:01:52.559" style="s2">you I have my own version of the story</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.280" end="02:01:55.280" style="s2">where instead of it being the slide from</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.559" end="02:01:57.179" style="s2">the paper of Grider and human it&#39;s</p>
