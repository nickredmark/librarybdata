<p begin="00:00:02.580" end="00:00:05.430" style="s2">cycle and unfortunately I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:07.410" style="s2">know the name so maybe you can find it</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:08.880" style="s2">and put it in a little subtext I forgot</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:11.610" style="s2">the name but it&#39;s the basic cycle of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:14.190" style="s2">know denial and acceptance and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:15.770" style="s2">bargaining all that stuff and this seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:18.359" style="s2">to be just an actual it&#39;s a kubler-ross</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.770" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">stages of grief yeah yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.359" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right so there we go</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:23.550" style="s2">so the Cooper of stages of grief seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">to be a part of just psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.550" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">Franklin&#39;s probably really good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">for it it&#39;s been selected for over long</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:30.330" style="s2">periods of time and lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">contexts and think of that it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">natural thing so no matter what when you</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">run into something that&#39;s going to hit</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">you with a big shift in change you will</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">go through that so don&#39;t fight it swim</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">swim with it so when you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">really depressed by the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:51.719" style="s2">things are much worse than you thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">in some sense if you can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.719" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">metacognitively aware of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">you&#39;re in the right place and just kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">of allow yourself to process that and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">the way it needs to be process so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:01.770" style="s2">can get into the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:02.969" style="s2">acceptance as smoothly as possible not</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.770" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">as quickly can make it go faster than</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.969" end="00:01:07.630" style="s2">you can then you&#39;re doing as well as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:08.950" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.630" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">I want to put a particular note I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.950" end="00:01:13.750" style="s2">noticed in myself at least four of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.409" end="00:01:16.360" style="s2">cycles but the last one was two days ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.750" end="00:01:17.890" style="s2">at 3:00 a.m. so something&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.360" end="00:01:19.329" style="s2">right now with this the rate of change</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.890" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">and the magnitude of change and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.329" end="00:01:23.649" style="s2">quality of changes is such that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:25.179" style="s2">acceptance which is to say to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.649" end="00:01:27.970" style="s2">step into the building an adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.179" end="00:01:29.829" style="s2">response to what is actually finds</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.970" end="00:01:31.270" style="s2">itself yet again overwhelmed by a change</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.829" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">of what it is that is big enough and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.270" end="00:01:34.210" style="s2">magnitude required that you actually go</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:37.090" style="s2">through on your cycle so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.210" end="00:01:38.799" style="s2">like an unfortunately powerful part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.090" end="00:01:40.450" style="s2">what&#39;s happened but then we actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.799" end="00:01:42.189" style="s2">have a different dynamic and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.450" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">dynamic of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.189" end="00:01:47.979" style="s2">which has to do law mostly with denial</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:51.549" style="s2">this is a breakdown of our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.979" end="00:01:53.930" style="s2">in choice making system where reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.549" end="00:01:55.550" style="s2">hits us</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.930" end="00:01:56.930" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not it&#39;s this this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.550" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">Cooper Ross system but a particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.930" end="00:02:01.070" style="s2">subset of what happens it&#39;s a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:06.170" style="s2">closing of their Reiki as we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.070" end="00:02:07.820" style="s2">describes so reality hits us and we kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.170" end="00:02:12.140" style="s2">of have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.820" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">we can either deal with the this cycle</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.140" end="00:02:15.290" style="s2">deal with the unpleasantness of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:18.920" style="s2">cycle and the necessity of actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.290" end="00:02:21.500" style="s2">changing our behavior or we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.920" end="00:02:25.730" style="s2">ourselves all right and we have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.500" end="00:02:27.890" style="s2">choice and if we happen to have in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.730" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">sense the privilege the benefit of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.890" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">able to ourselves and not have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">reality really kick us in the teeth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:38.510" style="s2">all too easy to ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:40.550" style="s2">if the magnitude of change that we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.510" end="00:02:43.459" style="s2">to go through in the context of reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.550" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">feels uncomfortable enough all right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.459" end="00:02:47.390" style="s2">we get this kind of separation this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:51.290" style="s2">why by the way addiction can really</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.390" end="00:02:53.890" style="s2">really hammer the wealthy because money</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.290" end="00:02:55.569" style="s2">allows you to by not changing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.890" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">a lot easier you don&#39;t hit rock bottom</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.569" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">as painfully</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.209" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">which is kind of an odd thing like</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:05.659" style="s2">oftentimes people who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:08.090" style="s2">resources get it gets really bad because</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.659" end="00:03:09.859" style="s2">they do hit rock bottom but the amount</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.090" end="00:03:12.079" style="s2">of sort of what gets pulled with them</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.859" end="00:03:13.640" style="s2">and duration in life may in fact be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.079" end="00:03:16.639" style="s2">shorter cycle we hit rock bottom in</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.640" end="00:03:18.230" style="s2">years as opposed to in decades but in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.639" end="00:03:21.109" style="s2">any event as a cultures is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.230" end="00:03:22.639" style="s2">the case so in the West the max the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.109" end="00:03:24.260" style="s2">massive plenitude that we&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.639" end="00:03:26.540" style="s2">to produce over the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:29.269" style="s2">seventy years has given us the ability</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.540" end="00:03:31.689" style="s2">to sort of kick the can down the road to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.269" end="00:03:33.919" style="s2">go into bullshitting ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.689" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">avoiding the uncomfortable reality of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.919" end="00:03:35.870" style="s2">the necessity of changing what are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:38.060" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.870" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">rather significant pieces of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.060" end="00:03:41.540" style="s2">behavior and our infrastructure and our</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:43.370" style="s2">institutions and by the way stepping</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.540" end="00:03:44.689" style="s2">into a lot of uncertainty will change</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.370" end="00:03:46.370" style="s2">requires actually stepping away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.689" end="00:03:48.870" style="s2">certainty into uncertainty that by</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.370" end="00:03:51.340" style="s2">itself isn&#39;t conquer</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.870" end="00:03:53.560" style="s2">and of course if you do that if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.340" end="00:03:55.720" style="s2"> yourself reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.560" end="00:03:56.739" style="s2">well sometimes reality just goes away</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.720" end="00:03:58.030" style="s2">sometimes it actually works out</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.739" end="00:03:59.650" style="s2">sometimes the thing that you were trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.030" end="00:04:01.870" style="s2">to avoid thinking about actually does go</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.650" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">away and you can yeah I got away with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.870" end="00:04:05.110" style="s2">which by the way reinforces the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:06.580" style="s2">but generally speaking it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.110" end="00:04:07.750" style="s2">generally speaking reality is reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.580" end="00:04:08.890" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t really care how much you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.750" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2"> yourself in fact generally</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.890" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">speaking people pushing yourself you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:15.099" style="s2">make matters worse so you know the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:17.200" style="s2">day reality comes knocking at the door</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.099" end="00:04:19.570" style="s2">and says hey it&#39;s time to change and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.200" end="00:04:20.889" style="s2">something just went wrong again you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.570" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">faced a choice but now you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.889" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">deeper in because the magnitude of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2"> the delusional story that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:31.630" style="s2">begin telling yourself and the self the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:32.680" style="s2">self denial and the narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.630" end="00:04:37.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve constructed to enable your</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.680" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2"> have a bigger control over</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.000" end="00:04:39.729" style="s2">where you are and you have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.870" end="00:04:41.710" style="s2">go through the field you have to feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.729" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">all the discomfort you&#39;ve been delaying</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.710" end="00:04:46.969" style="s2">at once so instead of being discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:49.489" style="s2">of one now its discomfort of three</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.969" end="00:04:50.599" style="s2">so you have a choice you get a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.489" end="00:04:52.789" style="s2">into the rabbit hole and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.599" end="00:04:53.839" style="s2">yourself even further or do you suck it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.789" end="00:04:55.279" style="s2">up and go through the even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.839" end="00:04:57.799" style="s2">magnets you just change you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.279" end="00:05:01.009" style="s2">through generally speaking people will</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.799" end="00:05:03.319" style="s2">often choose the first path and again if</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.009" end="00:05:04.819" style="s2">you can get away with it you can throw</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.319" end="00:05:06.379" style="s2">more it&#39;s just just like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.819" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">financial system is a very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.379" end="00:05:10.830" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">2008 reality hit us and said you guys</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.830" end="00:05:14.520" style="s2">have been really this up for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:17.940" style="s2">long time the global financial system is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.520" end="00:05:19.979" style="s2">not functional its hyper fragile it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.940" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">optimized for efficiency it&#39;s making bad</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.979" end="00:05:25.470" style="s2">choices bad resource allocation got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:26.539" style="s2">change this in a big way big banks gotta</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.470" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.539" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">probably even centralized banks as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.819" style="s2">mechanism they&#39;ve gotta go this whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:34.319" style="s2">structure and our global collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.819" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">intelligence governance system said oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.319" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">that sounds really painful nope you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:41.130" style="s2">I&#39;d rather do I&#39;d like to take a double</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.539" style="s2">shot of heroin and amphetamines did we</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">get a big shot of heroin in bet amines</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.539" end="00:05:48.479" style="s2">well yes we can okay good let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:49.560" style="s2">instead and of course there&#39;s a period</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:51.180" style="s2">of time I was like where all that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.560" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">feta means wasn&#39;t enough we need a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.180" end="00:05:55.949" style="s2">more which is like putting a load of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.240" style="s2">money quantitative easing just basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.949" end="00:05:58.650" style="s2">printing money right</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.240" end="00:06:00.210" style="s2">yeah listen let&#39;s cut interest rates a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.650" end="00:06:01.860" style="s2">quarter point but I didn&#39;t work okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.210" end="00:06:03.210" style="s2">let&#39;s cut it half a point that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.860" end="00:06:04.469" style="s2">work that&#39;s good as zero interest rates</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:06.210" style="s2">well that&#39;s not working anymore that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.469" end="00:06:08.129" style="s2">go to negative interest rates it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.210" end="00:06:10.050" style="s2">kind of that cycle and the point of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.129" end="00:06:11.219" style="s2">stage is that each one of those decision</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.050" end="00:06:12.630" style="s2">points was a decision point where you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.219" end="00:06:15.300" style="s2">could decide either to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.630" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">more or suck it up and actually good</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">through the change necessary to get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:23.969" style="s2">actual sobriety and so at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:25.650" style="s2">the financial system like reality had</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.969" end="00:06:27.210" style="s2">percolated through the crisis it can</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.650" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">have come enough to an end that by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.210" end="00:06:34.889" style="s2">time that we were sitting around in 2014</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:36.449" style="s2">2015 2016 and in our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.889" end="00:06:39.979" style="s2">producing stimulants was strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.449" end="00:06:43.889" style="s2">that we went through a felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.979" end="00:06:45.779" style="s2">another high but it wasn&#39;t a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.889" end="00:06:47.009" style="s2">but the underlying damage is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.779" end="00:06:49.130" style="s2">heavy it&#39;s a little bit like you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.009" end="00:06:52.050" style="s2">imagine that you were running a race and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.130" end="00:06:55.229" style="s2">you like fell and sprained your ankle</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.050" end="00:06:56.699" style="s2">really badly but you just decided to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.229" end="00:06:58.440" style="s2">wrap it up with some tape and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.699" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">inject yourself with a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.440" end="00:07:03.240" style="s2">painkillers and stimulants and just went</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:04.740" style="s2">back running on the on the ankle well if</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.240" end="00:07:06.029" style="s2">you&#39;re under if you&#39;re when you&#39;re under</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.740" end="00:07:08.099" style="s2">the influence of the painkillers and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.029" end="00:07:09.900" style="s2">stimulants and the rappers it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.099" end="00:07:11.340" style="s2">good enough you might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.900" end="00:07:12.780" style="s2">running pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.340" end="00:07:14.850" style="s2">but you&#39;re doing damage to the ankle and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.780" end="00:07:17.010" style="s2">when the stimulants the pain cause we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.850" end="00:07:18.210" style="s2">off your now even worse than you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.010" end="00:07:20.040" style="s2">before so that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.210" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">right now and the financial system the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.040" end="00:07:23.910" style="s2">magnitude of what&#39;s being done right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:27.540" style="s2">in the US and this is going to cascade</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.910" end="00:07:29.610" style="s2">globally of course is like a whole step</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.540" end="00:07:31.650" style="s2">up from everything that happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.610" end="00:07:33.690" style="s2">period between 2008 and 2012 like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.650" end="00:07:37.050" style="s2">like 2 or 3 times X already we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.690" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">four or five days in which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.050" end="00:07:40.230" style="s2">that we&#39;re just continuing to choose to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:42.470" style="s2"> ourselves the addict is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.230" end="00:07:45.180" style="s2">continuing to choose to update the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.470" end="00:07:48.440" style="s2">delusional story whatever you do don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.180" end="00:07:52.650" style="s2">pay attention to what&#39;s real and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.440" end="00:07:54.210" style="s2">doubling down on the the stimulant the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.650" end="00:07:56.490" style="s2">thing that allows the system to continue</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.210" end="00:07:59.550" style="s2">to operate as if reality isn&#39;t what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.490" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">is and you know eventually as every</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.550" end="00:08:04.860" style="s2">addict knows you hit rock bottom and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:06.480" style="s2">always have a choice when you hit rock</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.860" end="00:08:08.370" style="s2">bottom you had a moment of clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.480" end="00:08:10.260" style="s2">the moment of clarity you can finally</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.370" end="00:08:11.940" style="s2">choose to just take in to get into</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.260" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">complete acceptance and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.940" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">oftentimes the I believe the story is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.240" end="00:08:19.140" style="s2">submit to a higher power</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:20.250" style="s2">there&#39;s surrender and begin to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.140" end="00:08:21.420" style="s2">I really don&#39;t know how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.250" end="00:08:22.470" style="s2">this I need to actually begin learning</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.420" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">from the beginning again</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.470" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">and realize I got to take my lumps</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:29.040" style="s2">actually have to grow through the change</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:30.630" style="s2">that has to happen to get to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.040" end="00:08:34.230" style="s2">brought us to sobriety and ultimate to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.630" end="00:08:36.300" style="s2">health or you can go right back down to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.230" end="00:08:39.480" style="s2">the denial cycle until ultimately death</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:40.890" style="s2">right and I think that&#39;s again that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.480" end="00:08:42.180" style="s2">really good conceptual model as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.890" end="00:08:44.610" style="s2">done we kind of moving back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.180" end="00:08:48.510" style="s2">between the individual human biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.610" end="00:08:49.890" style="s2">example and the financial example and by</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.510" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">the way if you&#39;d like you can transpose</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.890" end="00:08:57.180" style="s2">this to the political side for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:58.830" style="s2">but what would it look like for like if</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.180" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">this is denial what would actually look</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.830" end="00:09:05.330" style="s2">like to face reality and what would the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.070" end="00:09:05.330" style="s2">changes need to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.640" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">oh okay just throw the maybe yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.910" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">this is something that I&#39;ve been looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:17.100" style="s2">at for now again about 15 years so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">actually not that in some sense not that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.100" end="00:09:22.010" style="s2">mysterious I&#39;ve already already laid out</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:25.560" style="s2">most of it you know the first is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.010" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">accept you&#39;ve got a problem let&#39;s do a a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.560" end="00:09:29.190" style="s2">like the AAA guys have cut it</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:31.380" style="s2">and kind of wired first except you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.190" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">got a problem I&#39;d stop denying that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.380" end="00:09:35.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">second begin the process of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.790" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">awareness and relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:40.470" style="s2">reality of the problem like begin the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:42.329" style="s2">process of actually stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.470" end="00:09:44.670" style="s2">reality so in this case for example I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.329" end="00:09:47.430" style="s2">would propose it would be quite helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.670" end="00:09:48.870" style="s2">to have a collective conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.430" end="00:09:50.540" style="s2">acceptance of the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.870" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">meta-crisis that I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.540" end="00:09:56.910" style="s2">that the thing in front of us the acute</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:09:59.190" style="s2">crisis is a symptom of a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.910" end="00:10:02.370" style="s2">chronic crisis that has been ongoing for</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.190" end="00:10:04.200" style="s2">a long period of time and to to reach a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.370" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">level of acceptance of the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.200" end="00:10:07.130" style="s2">change and in some sense at least the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">qualities of change that need to occur</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.130" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">for example if I&#39;m a baby boomer who has</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:17.699" style="s2">been holding on to the reins of power of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:20.820" style="s2">particular institutional structures for</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.699" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">a long time I think it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.820" end="00:10:26.699" style="s2">acknowledge the generational transfer is</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:28.410" style="s2">an actual necessity I think it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.699" end="00:10:32.259" style="s2">acknowledge that the reality is is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.410" end="00:10:34.839" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.259" end="00:10:36.459" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay it&#39;s not my job to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.839" end="00:10:37.779" style="s2">what to do there are other people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.459" end="00:10:39.069" style="s2">are younger than me that have grown up</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.779" end="00:10:40.119" style="s2">in completely different environments</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.069" end="00:10:41.439" style="s2">that better instincts have better</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.439" end="00:10:47.689" style="s2">currently live in it&#39;s their job to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.899" end="00:10:49.459" style="s2">what to do now I may actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.689" end="00:10:51.379" style="s2">deeper connection to why if I&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.459" end="00:10:52.670" style="s2">life well and full and thoroughly that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.379" end="00:10:54.769" style="s2">actually have developed invited wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.670" end="00:10:59.119" style="s2">and I can start trying to present why</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.769" end="00:11:01.129" style="s2">and this notion of we who we might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.119" end="00:11:02.600" style="s2">like the deep tradition the deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.129" end="00:11:03.910" style="s2">tradition is still carried in my body</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.600" end="00:11:06.709" style="s2">and the way the young Google can&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.709" end="00:11:11.529" style="s2">that we ought to be engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.009" end="00:11:13.149" style="s2">okay boomer is a archetypal and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.529" end="00:11:15.549" style="s2">practical sign of the reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.149" end="00:11:17.079" style="s2">case you&#39;re out of the loop you</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.149" end="00:12:26.759" style="s2">right now is to recognize that is just a</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.740" end="00:12:43.439" style="s2">now it&#39;s the time to really think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.639" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">hitting a reboot on the whole thing and</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:05.129" style="s2">the patient but by definition that means</p>
