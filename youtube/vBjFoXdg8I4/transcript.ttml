<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:08.069" style="s2">well-meaning people is that this has</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.970" end="00:00:11.070" style="s2">been tried before and it&#39;s not worth it</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.069" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that works and if</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.070" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">that was true I would put more stock</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">into it if we had actually tried</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">creating a maintaining technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">together there is no failure at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:25.050" style="s2">because every time something goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:26.519" style="s2">we ask what went wrong and try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.050" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">improve it together and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.519" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist in all of these one-off</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:31.529" style="s2">projects someone who created an</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">alternative to Facebook and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.529" end="00:00:34.530" style="s2">successful of course it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">successful you&#39;re competing with</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.530" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">Facebook the only way to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">Facebook is to do it together is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">create a social media tool we actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">want to use with ten thousand people a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">hundred thousand people a million people</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">not a dozen people creating it and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">hoping they can market it and get you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:54.059" style="s2">entice you over from Facebook and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">the one offs that instagrams and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">snapchats are somewhat successful until</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">they&#39;re bought out by the by the big</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">companies and that is success the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:08.369" style="s2">individual projects I have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">I am bg4 politician a maybe Netflix of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.369" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">apps all of these things have probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">been tried before and they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">succeeded but that wasn&#39;t us trying it</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t us taking on risk collectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:20.610" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t us solving the marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">funding problem one time so that every</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:25.229" style="s2">new individual project gets to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">economies of scale and cost less and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">less money as we move forward and have</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">more and more people come on board and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">say what works for them and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">work for them every time a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">technology is made and then it fails we</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">have less trust in the new the next one</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:41.610" style="s2">every time one comes on board and fails</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:44.040" style="s2">we&#39;re like oh that was tried and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.610" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">didn&#39;t work no it has to be so perfect</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.040" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">to work that of course it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to create perfect we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">going to create good enough and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna keep improving it together</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s ours it&#39;s not me selling</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">you something and it&#39;s an inferior</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">product it&#39;s ours what is the bare</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">minimum we need and then how do we keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">improving it and as far as I know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">has never been done before</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">cooperatives have been done before</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">cooperatives are powerful but a user</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">owned technology company that&#39;s here to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:14.730" style="s2">create all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:17.219" style="s2">technology we need to live our</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.730" end="00:02:19.769" style="s2">individual lives to create community to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.219" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">create systems and platforms that help</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.769" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">make our lives better by empowering the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">individual people to say what they need</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">and then employing people to create it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">that has never been done before</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">that is the powerful piece creating it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:32.970" style="s2">together looking for what&#39;s working and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">making more of it we look for what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.970" end="00:02:37.379" style="s2">working and making less of it improving</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:39.389" style="s2">it creating diversity cuz technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.379" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">allows us to unlock diversity we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.389" end="00:02:42.569" style="s2">need branding our social media site</p>
