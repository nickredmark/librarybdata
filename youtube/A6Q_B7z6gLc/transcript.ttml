<p begin="00:01:46.030" end="00:01:53.079" style="s2">last time we did very quickly to remind</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.630" end="00:01:56.409" style="s2">you a series of arguments a series of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.079" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">arguments that pointed towards how</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.409" end="00:02:01.780" style="s2">central relevance realization is we did</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:05.020" style="s2">arguments around the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.780" end="00:02:07.990" style="s2">problem-solving and remember we saw the</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.990" end="00:02:13.209" style="s2">proposed by Newland Simon and we faced a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.070" end="00:02:17.519" style="s2">couple of important issues there we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.209" end="00:02:17.519" style="s2">faced issues of combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.549" end="00:02:26.790" style="s2">and what we need is right problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.750" end="00:02:26.790" style="s2">formulation or problem framing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:34.180" style="s2">that allows us to avoid combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.420" end="00:02:42.040" style="s2">explosion by zeroing in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.180" end="00:02:43.960" style="s2">information I also propose to you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.040" end="00:02:45.520" style="s2">I&#39;ll return to this later that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.960" end="00:02:47.740" style="s2">problem-solving is our best way of</p>

<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">general problem solver also we noted the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">problem of ill-defined it nests very</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:04.420" style="s2">often a problem formulation is needed in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.900" end="00:03:06.580" style="s2">order to determine what the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.420" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">information is and what the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.580" end="00:03:14.170" style="s2">structure of that information is so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:16.270" style="s2">again points us into relevance these two</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.170" end="00:03:17.950" style="s2">together also pointed towards a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.270" end="00:03:20.320" style="s2">phenomena we have we have already talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.950" end="00:03:23.020" style="s2">about insight and the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.320" end="00:03:27.090" style="s2">often have to solve a problem by</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.020" end="00:03:29.590" style="s2">altering your problem formulation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.090" end="00:03:34.440" style="s2">re-determine in what you consider</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:36.730" style="s2">relevant we then took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.440" end="00:03:39.370" style="s2">categorization I&#39;ll come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.730" end="00:03:41.410" style="s2">again in another way a little bit later</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.370" end="00:03:44.370" style="s2">in this lecture but we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.410" end="00:03:47.560" style="s2">how categorization ultimately depends on</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.370" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">judgments of similarity and we can get</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:52.300" style="s2">into an equivocation there we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">equivocate between purely logical or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.300" end="00:03:58.770" style="s2">purely logical notion of similarity in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:04:01.390" style="s2">which case any two objects are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.770" end="00:04:03.940" style="s2">indefinitely similar or dissimilar to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.390" end="00:04:06.010" style="s2">each other and if we mean instead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.940" end="00:04:08.680" style="s2">logical similarity which would not help</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.010" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">us to categorize psychological</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.680" end="00:04:16.060" style="s2">similarity then we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:19.030" style="s2">making a comparison of two things in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.060" end="00:04:22.510" style="s2">terms of the relevant features of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.030" end="00:04:23.740" style="s2">comparison the relevant aspects so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.510" end="00:04:25.540" style="s2">in two relevance and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.740" end="00:04:28.210" style="s2">introducing an important idea I want you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.540" end="00:04:31.450" style="s2">to remember this notion of an aspect a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.210" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">set of relevant features that cohere</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.450" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">together and are relevant to us</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:39.419" style="s2">especially in projects like</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:39.419" style="s2">categorization</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.530" end="00:04:44.450" style="s2">all right so we keep getting this of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:48.680" style="s2">course I mean if you remember doing good</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.450" end="00:04:51.920" style="s2"> I I do a convergence argument to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.680" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">get a trustworthy problem or construct</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.920" end="00:04:56.390" style="s2">and then I basically do a divergence</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:04:57.920" style="s2">argument to show how it has the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.390" end="00:05:00.110" style="s2">potential to explain many important</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.920" end="00:05:02.660" style="s2">phenomena and establish a relevant</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:04.310" style="s2">balance between them and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.660" end="00:05:07.460" style="s2">I&#39;m building you right now we&#39;re on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.310" end="00:05:09.410" style="s2">side how all these things are converging</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.460" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">on relevance realization and then as I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.410" end="00:05:15.350" style="s2">said can we use this to explain many of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:17.960" style="s2">the features that seem to be central to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.350" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">human spirituality meaning making self</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.960" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">transcendence altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:29.720" style="s2">consciousness and wisdom we then took a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.490" end="00:05:31.010" style="s2">look at communication I don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.720" end="00:05:32.900" style="s2">order we I think we did we might have</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.010" end="00:05:36.110" style="s2">done the robot first doesn&#39;t matter we</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.900" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">did communication and we saw the issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.110" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2">here there is the fact that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">convey more than you can say and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.150" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">that led us into the work of grace and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:48.290" style="s2">series of Maxim&#39;s that make</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.650" end="00:05:52.310" style="s2">conversational implicature possible and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.290" end="00:05:54.950" style="s2">that got us into write that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.310" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">Maxim&#39;s collapsed to the rack maximum of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.950" end="00:06:04.520" style="s2">being relevant we then did or we can now</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:05.780" style="s2">remember are doing the issue of robotics</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.520" end="00:06:08.150" style="s2">the actual interaction with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.780" end="00:06:11.300" style="s2">environment here&#39;s the idea of being an</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.150" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">agent and we saw the robot was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.300" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">pull the battery that also that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">wagon and that wagon also has the bomb</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:24.220" style="s2">on it and what we saw is the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:24.220" style="s2">the proliferation of side effects</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.750" end="00:06:30.470" style="s2">you can&#39;t ignore all side effects or</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:32.660" style="s2">you&#39;ll be grotesquely stupid you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.470" end="00:06:35.390" style="s2">check all side effects or you&#39;ll be crow</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.660" end="00:06:38.180" style="s2">testicle incapable and so therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.390" end="00:06:40.910" style="s2">have to zoom in on their relevant side</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.180" end="00:06:43.669" style="s2">effects so again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.910" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">everything is centering on this I want</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.669" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">you to I want you to also now remember a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:50.120" style="s2">couple of other things from previous</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">lectures how we talked about the</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.780" end="00:07:52.830" style="s2">we see that we&#39;ve getting actually a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:57.389" style="s2">very powerful convergence argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.830" end="00:08:03.659" style="s2">towards the centrality of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.389" end="00:08:08.280" style="s2">realization as how do I want to say this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.659" end="00:08:10.669" style="s2">as constitutive as constitutive of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.280" end="00:08:14.219" style="s2">intelligence your cognitive agency has</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.669" end="00:08:18.780" style="s2">significantly contributory towards your</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.780" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">I also suggested to you last time that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.810" end="00:08:25.319" style="s2">this notion of relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">this is what we&#39;re going to develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.319" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">today may be a way of explaining that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:35.579" style="s2">sort of fundamental aspect of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">the kind of meaning that was lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.579" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">meaning crisis that&#39;s expressed in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:43.110" style="s2">three orders that in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:46.310" style="s2">pursuing coherence and significance and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:48.690" style="s2">purpose that that sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:50.579" style="s2">connectedness and I&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.690" end="00:08:53.459" style="s2">argue that as we understand what</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.579" end="00:08:55.410" style="s2">relevance is that relevance is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.459" end="00:08:59.250" style="s2">that sense of connectedness so there</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.410" end="00:09:02.550" style="s2">will be deep connections between meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.250" end="00:09:04.589" style="s2">and relevance and of course we this will</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.550" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">make sense right see what I&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.589" end="00:09:11.459" style="s2">here there&#39;s deep connections between</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:12.360" style="s2">meaning and all this relevance right</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.459" end="00:09:14.579" style="s2">there&#39;s deep connections between</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.360" end="00:09:17.459" style="s2">relevance and agency that&#39;s the whole</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.459" end="00:09:23.699" style="s2">right and there&#39;s going to be deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.269" end="00:09:25.980" style="s2">connections we&#39;ve already seen between</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.699" end="00:09:28.980" style="s2">of course meaning an agency that one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.980" end="00:09:31.980" style="s2">the whole things about agency is its</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.389" end="00:09:48.329" style="s2">making projects alright so I hope I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">made at least a good convergence</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.329" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">argument for you that many things</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.430" end="00:10:15.089" style="s2">been sort of the core of my I guess</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.230" end="00:10:28.829" style="s2">also want to try and argue that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.949" end="00:10:56.130" style="s2">are good ones out there there&#39;s the work</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.700" end="00:15:40.290" style="s2">all I need whatever else representations</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.430" end="00:15:41.370" style="s2">are in all that controversy that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.290" end="00:15:42.600" style="s2">need for the point I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.370" end="00:15:45.210" style="s2">because I want to show you something</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.600" end="00:15:46.670" style="s2">very important about a representation</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.210" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">and I mentioned it a few</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.670" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s ago and this is a point that John</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">Searle has famously made representations</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:16:00.470" style="s2">are a spec xual okay so I hold this</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:02.990" style="s2">thing up and you form a representation</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.470" end="00:16:04.250" style="s2">of it right remember all the things we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.990" end="00:16:06.440" style="s2">talked about when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.250" end="00:16:09.320" style="s2">categorization we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.440" end="00:16:13.460" style="s2">similarity etc so when you form a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.320" end="00:16:16.550" style="s2">representation you do not write grasped</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.460" end="00:16:19.370" style="s2">all of the true properties of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.550" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">object because right all of the true</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.370" end="00:16:24.620" style="s2">properties the number is combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:29.150" style="s2">explosive you&#39;ve already seen that so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.620" end="00:16:31.790" style="s2">out of all of the properties right you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.150" end="00:16:34.010" style="s2">just select some subset and what subset</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.790" end="00:16:37.340" style="s2">do you pick well you pick a subset that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.010" end="00:16:39.860" style="s2">is here it comes relevant to you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.340" end="00:16:41.480" style="s2">they just a feature list no we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.860" end="00:16:43.190" style="s2">already seen that a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.480" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">they are right to have a structural</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.190" end="00:16:46.610" style="s2">functional organization they&#39;re made</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:47.870" style="s2">relevant to each other so here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.610" end="00:16:50.450" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a set of features that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.870" end="00:16:52.700" style="s2">relevant to each other and then a set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.450" end="00:16:54.230" style="s2">features that set of features that have</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.700" end="00:16:56.450" style="s2">been structurally functional organized</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.230" end="00:17:00.080" style="s2">so that they have Co relevance is then</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.450" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">relevant to me that&#39;s what an aspect is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.080" end="00:17:07.040" style="s2">right so whenever I&#39;m representing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:09.830" style="s2">anything this is a marker however I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:14.870" style="s2">could change its aspect you a Latino</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.830" end="00:17:16.790" style="s2">weapon alright and we do that all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.870" end="00:17:18.890" style="s2">time in fact one of the ways we check</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.790" end="00:17:21.830" style="s2">the people&#39;s creativity is to do exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.890" end="00:17:24.710" style="s2">that we will give some object and say</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.830" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">how many different ways can you use it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.710" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">how many different ways can you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:28.790" style="s2">categorize it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:30.650" style="s2">how namely how many different ways how</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.790" end="00:17:33.310" style="s2">flexible are you in getting different</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.650" end="00:17:35.870" style="s2">aspects from the same object so</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.310" end="00:17:38.110" style="s2">representations are inherently a spectra</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.870" end="00:17:41.480" style="s2">but notice the language I was using</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.110" end="00:17:43.310" style="s2">zeroing on relevant properties right out</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.480" end="00:17:44.660" style="s2">of all the possible properties you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.310" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">structuring them as how they&#39;re Co</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.660" end="00:17:49.430" style="s2">relevant to each other and then how that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:52.060" style="s2">right structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.430" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">is relevant to you a spec shoe allottee</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.060" end="00:17:58.450" style="s2">deeply presuppose is maybe that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:17:58.450" style="s2">incorrect arrow</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">let&#39;s just put presupposes deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.460" end="00:18:08.239" style="s2">presupposes the ability to zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:11.509" style="s2">relevance do relevance realization that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.239" end="00:18:14.899" style="s2">means that representations can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.509" end="00:18:18.649" style="s2">ultimately be that generators of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.899" end="00:18:22.669" style="s2">creators of relevance they can&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.649" end="00:18:25.970" style="s2">causal origin of relevance now can our</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.669" end="00:18:27.889" style="s2">representations feed back and alter what</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.970" end="00:18:29.559" style="s2">we find relevant of course nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.889" end="00:18:31.879" style="s2">denying that that&#39;s of course why we use</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.559" end="00:18:34.669" style="s2">representations but what they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.879" end="00:18:39.739" style="s2">serve they can&#39;t serve as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.669" end="00:18:42.529" style="s2">ontological basis the the the stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.739" end="00:18:44.599" style="s2">reality that we&#39;re trying to use to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.529" end="00:18:47.389" style="s2">generate a non-circular encounter</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.599" end="00:18:51.849" style="s2">relevance realization now that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.389" end="00:18:55.489" style="s2">to tell us something really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.849" end="00:18:58.489" style="s2">it&#39;s going to tell us that if this</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.489" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">meaning and this spirituality is what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.489" end="00:19:04.909" style="s2">bound to relevance realization that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.820" end="00:19:06.609" style="s2">place to look for it is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.909" end="00:19:09.169" style="s2">found at the level of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.609" end="00:19:11.889" style="s2">representational cognition the level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.169" end="00:19:16.159" style="s2">our cognition that is using ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.889" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">propositions pictures etc once again I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.159" end="00:19:22.340" style="s2">am NOT saying that those things do not</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">contribute or effect what we consider</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.340" end="00:19:28.940" style="s2">relevant what I&#39;m saying is they are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:32.299" style="s2">the source the locus of how we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.940" end="00:19:35.659" style="s2">relevance realization I want to show you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.299" end="00:19:39.830" style="s2">how this cashes out even in an empirical</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.659" end="00:19:41.299" style="s2">manner this goes to some really</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.830" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">interesting work done by Zen and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.299" end="00:19:48.889" style="s2">politian right on what&#39;s called multiple</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:50.210" style="s2">object tracking and multiple object</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.889" end="00:19:52.239" style="s2">tracking is really interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.210" end="00:19:55.129" style="s2">basically what you do is you give people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.239" end="00:19:57.019" style="s2">like a bunch of objects on a computer</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.129" end="00:19:58.669" style="s2">screen let&#39;s say I have X&#39;s and O&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.019" end="00:20:00.649" style="s2">they&#39;ll be different colors they can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.669" end="00:20:03.710" style="s2">different shapes right all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.649" end="00:20:05.629" style="s2">things like this and what I do is I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.710" end="00:20:08.330" style="s2">the objects move around and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.629" end="00:20:10.729" style="s2">this was the red X and then after it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.330" end="00:20:11.730" style="s2">moves around I ask you where&#39;s the red X</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.729" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">and you have to point</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.730" end="00:20:16.200" style="s2">I may ask you a where&#39;s the green circle</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:20.100" style="s2">where&#39;s the blue square you get the task</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.200" end="00:20:23.130" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting is how much you</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.100" end="00:20:26.309" style="s2">can do this you can track about eight</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.130" end="00:20:28.590" style="s2">that&#39;s on average objects reliably</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.309" end="00:20:31.019" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting about them</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.590" end="00:20:33.659" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting is the more</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.019" end="00:20:36.389" style="s2">objects you track the less and less</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.659" end="00:20:38.570" style="s2">features you can attribute to each</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.389" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">object what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.570" end="00:20:43.590" style="s2">suppose I&#39;m tracking that that&#39;s six but</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.850" end="00:20:46.639" style="s2">suppose it was eight I was tracking the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.590" end="00:20:50.639" style="s2">red X and I have to keep it right if</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.639" end="00:20:52.409" style="s2">right I can I can after lots of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.639" end="00:20:54.690" style="s2">movements say oh it&#39;s there now it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.409" end="00:20:58.230" style="s2">started there and it&#39;s there now what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.690" end="00:21:02.690" style="s2">won&#39;t notice during that is that the red</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.230" end="00:21:02.690" style="s2">X has become for example a Blue Square</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:10.019" style="s2">so all of its content properties get</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.230" end="00:21:11.909" style="s2">lost all I&#39;m tracking and I need you to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.019" end="00:21:16.200" style="s2">remember this is what you might call the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.909" end="00:21:19.769" style="s2">hereness where is it and the nowness of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.200" end="00:21:21.090" style="s2">it where is it it&#39;s here now it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.769" end="00:21:22.950" style="s2">now it&#39;s here now it&#39;s here now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.090" end="00:21:25.909" style="s2">here now it&#39;s here now everything else</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.950" end="00:21:30.019" style="s2">its shape its color its categorical</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.909" end="00:21:35.940" style="s2">identity all gets lost so he calls this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.019" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">he calls this fin sting this stands for</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.940" end="00:21:40.649" style="s2">fingers of instantiation his basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.820" end="00:21:41.970" style="s2">is like this your mind has something</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.649" end="00:21:44.010" style="s2">equivalent to putting your finger on</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.970" end="00:21:45.809" style="s2">something I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what this</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.010" end="00:21:47.460" style="s2">is suppose I didn&#39;t know what it was I</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.809" end="00:21:49.529" style="s2">put my finger on it I don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.460" end="00:21:52.049" style="s2">is I just know it&#39;s here nowness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.529" end="00:21:54.090" style="s2">here now it&#39;s here now here and now our</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.049" end="00:21:56.370" style="s2">indexical x&#39; these are terms that just</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.090" end="00:21:59.130" style="s2">refer to the context of the speaker so</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.370" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">here now right and it moves around and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.130" end="00:22:06.330" style="s2">my mind can keep in touch notice my</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.539" end="00:22:18.389" style="s2">that&#39;s doing it&#39;s just tracking that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:20.429" style="s2">here nowness well that&#39;s really cool now</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.389" end="00:22:22.169" style="s2">what why do we have this ability well</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.429" end="00:22:24.900" style="s2">first of all I&#39;m going to propose a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.169" end="00:22:26.130" style="s2">of thinking about this he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.900" end="00:22:27.810" style="s2">this language but I think it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.130" end="00:22:30.390" style="s2">helpful I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in any way</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.810" end="00:22:37.260" style="s2">inconsistent disability to do this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.390" end="00:22:40.850" style="s2">like salience tagging okay when I touch</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.260" end="00:22:43.920" style="s2">this I&#39;m making this here nowness</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.630" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">and we do this with demonstrative terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:04.620" style="s2">like this notice the word this is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:06.600" style="s2">like the word cat cat refers you to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.620" end="00:23:07.770" style="s2">specific thing we add meow the animal</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:22.280" style="s2">comments about cats right but this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.890" end="00:23:27.870" style="s2">like cat this can go watch this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.280" end="00:23:31.140" style="s2">this this okay it doesn&#39;t refer to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.870" end="00:23:33.420" style="s2">specific thing it picks out it does</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.340" end="00:23:38.700" style="s2">hearing this and nowness sorry for</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.230" end="00:23:54.420" style="s2">like this and here and now but</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.210" end="00:23:57.890" style="s2">especially this these are linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.420" end="00:24:02.520" style="s2">terms and they do what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.890" end="00:24:05.880" style="s2">demonstrative reference they do not</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.520" end="00:24:08.460" style="s2">refer to a particular thing they do not</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.460" end="00:24:18.870" style="s2">to wall but this this this this okay all</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.990" end="00:24:25.670" style="s2">they do is salience tagging this and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.870" end="00:24:28.050" style="s2">that now why is that important well</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.670" end="00:24:31.110" style="s2">politian wants you to understand fin</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.050" end="00:24:32.970" style="s2">sting it fin sting is obviously not a</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.100" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">to explain to you with this notion of</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:16.040" style="s2">nowness why is this so important well</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.040" end="00:25:19.530" style="s2">here&#39;s where the analogy can help me</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.040" end="00:25:23.070" style="s2">right I need demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.530" end="00:25:26.870" style="s2">I need inactive demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.070" end="00:25:30.680" style="s2">a before I can do any categorization</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.870" end="00:25:33.300" style="s2">look if I&#39;m going to categorize things I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.680" end="00:25:37.380" style="s2">need to mentally group them together</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.300" end="00:25:41.850" style="s2">this is mental grouping this this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.380" end="00:25:44.580" style="s2">this this that&#39;s what mental grouping is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.850" end="00:25:47.430" style="s2">mental grouping is two salient stagg</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.580" end="00:25:50.370" style="s2">things right and bound them together in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.430" end="00:25:54.330" style="s2">a salience tagging so what am i showing</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.370" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">you what am i trying to show you is any</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.330" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">categorization you have depends on</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.370" end="00:27:37.899" style="s2">does not mean that the thing itself is</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.899" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">categorization I&#39;ve given you an</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.809" end="00:27:45.909" style="s2">argument and I&#39;ve given you empirical</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:49.730" style="s2">evidence towards this claim and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.909" end="00:27:53.419" style="s2">massively right they massively converge</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.730" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">together now notice this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.419" end="00:27:57.830" style="s2">fundamental connectedness to reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:27:59.419" style="s2">you&#39;re getting with the fence thing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.830" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">the inactive demonstrative reference</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.419" end="00:28:03.470" style="s2">when you&#39;re getting that initial</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:06.980" style="s2">salience tagging because it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.470" end="00:28:10.639" style="s2">mind being in contact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.980" end="00:28:15.190" style="s2">that&#39;s why politian even uses the</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.690" end="00:28:23.350" style="s2">all right so the representational level</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.570" end="00:28:27.309" style="s2">is not going to give us what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.350" end="00:28:32.740" style="s2">looking for in fact we need to think</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.309" end="00:28:35.110" style="s2">about ways in which we need to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.740" end="00:28:39.820" style="s2">something that is sub representational</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.110" end="00:28:42.730" style="s2">so this is in the cog side we would call</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.820" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">that the the representational level is</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.730" end="00:28:48.550" style="s2">called a semantic level because this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:50.970" style="s2">the level at which words have meaning or</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.550" end="00:28:53.410" style="s2">by analogy at which representations have</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.970" end="00:28:55.330" style="s2">representational meaning so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.410" end="00:28:57.490" style="s2">go sub semantic we have to go sub</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.330" end="00:29:02.290" style="s2">categorical we have to go sub conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.490" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">now is that such up as our claim we saw</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.290" end="00:29:07.559" style="s2">in higher states of consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:13.050" style="s2">people claim to have the most profound</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.559" end="00:29:16.809" style="s2">sense of meaning and it is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.050" end="00:29:20.170" style="s2">ineffable they reliably across</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.809" end="00:29:24.010" style="s2">traditions across historical contexts</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.170" end="00:29:27.340" style="s2">claim that it is not conceptual it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.010" end="00:29:32.050" style="s2">be grasped categorically and they use</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.340" end="00:29:35.320" style="s2">the language of hereness and nowness to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.050" end="00:29:39.160" style="s2">describe it it&#39;s fully present it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.320" end="00:29:43.630" style="s2">you know eternal hereness and nowness so</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.160" end="00:29:46.690" style="s2">this is actually not a bizarre claim to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.630" end="00:29:51.780" style="s2">consider now it&#39;s difficult for us</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.690" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">because we habitually identify with</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.780" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">that&#39;s our ego structure I would say</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:59.820" style="s2">tends to we tend to identify with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:02.410" style="s2">way in which we are running</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.820" end="00:30:06.280" style="s2">representations in our mind in her</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.410" end="00:30:08.020" style="s2">pictures in her speech etc alright so</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.280" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">perhaps we could consider the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.020" end="00:30:17.130" style="s2">computational level as the level in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:17.130" style="s2">which we could explain</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.210" end="00:30:27.619" style="s2">relevance realization because we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.929" end="00:30:31.950" style="s2">found that the semantic level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.619" end="00:30:33.830" style="s2">representations is inadequate this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.950" end="00:30:36.539" style="s2">often called the syntactic level</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.830" end="00:30:39.480" style="s2">semantics is about how your terms refer</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.539" end="00:30:41.789" style="s2">to the world syntax is about how your</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.480" end="00:30:44.639" style="s2">various terms have to be coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.789" end="00:30:46.350" style="s2">together within some system so for</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.639" end="00:30:49.289" style="s2">example you know that there&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.350" end="00:30:50.610" style="s2">grammatical rules in English about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.289" end="00:30:53.759" style="s2">you can put certain things together</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.610" end="00:30:55.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the syntax so in computation what</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.759" end="00:30:59.909" style="s2">we&#39;re usually doing is we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.230" end="00:31:01.590" style="s2">about the relationship between our</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.909" end="00:31:03.450" style="s2">symbols I don&#39;t mean symbol in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:06.139" style="s2">religious sense I just mean the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.450" end="00:31:08.820" style="s2">that we&#39;re using within for example a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.139" end="00:31:10.470" style="s2">code in program or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.820" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.470" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">between them now there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:22.259" style="s2">issues around this and I want to point</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:24.629" style="s2">to a core argument by one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.259" end="00:31:26.369" style="s2">strongest defenders one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.629" end="00:31:28.950" style="s2">originators and defenders of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.369" end="00:31:30.269" style="s2">computational theory of mind so this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.950" end="00:31:32.279" style="s2">a tradition and you remember it goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.269" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">back to Hobbes of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.279" end="00:31:36.690" style="s2">cognition is computation that right we</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:39.720" style="s2">talked about this the manipulation of an</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.690" end="00:31:41.899" style="s2">abstract symbolic symbolic system like</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.720" end="00:31:44.519" style="s2">generally logical or mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.899" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">symbolic system the manipulation of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.519" end="00:31:51.929" style="s2">is what it is to think to think is to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:55.470" style="s2">computation now Fodor has pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.929" end="00:31:57.799" style="s2">and I think these are arguments in many</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.470" end="00:32:00.539" style="s2">ways analogous to to Vic in Stine and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.799" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">you have to remember he&#39;s a defender of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.539" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">the computational theory of mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">he&#39;s one of he&#39;s considered one of its</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:09.299" style="s2">founding figures within cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:11.159" style="s2">science so and he criticizes it we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.299" end="00:32:12.869" style="s2">to first of all do two things he died</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.159" end="00:32:16.200" style="s2">not that long ago but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.869" end="00:32:18.179" style="s2">congratulate him on his honesty as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.200" end="00:32:21.509" style="s2">researcher his the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.179" end="00:32:24.119" style="s2">self-criticism is for me a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.509" end="00:32:26.429" style="s2">demonstrative measure of how good a</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.119" end="00:32:29.190" style="s2">researcher is if you finding people that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.429" end="00:32:31.769" style="s2">are incapable of self-criticism in their</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.190" end="00:32:33.210" style="s2">intellectual pursuits then I suggest you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.769" end="00:32:35.540" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.210" end="00:32:38.510" style="s2">quite a wide berth in how much</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.540" end="00:32:41.190" style="s2">confidence you place in their work</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.510" end="00:32:43.140" style="s2">so the fact that he does that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:45.660" style="s2">important and the fact that he launches</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.140" end="00:32:48.330" style="s2">into that self-criticism means he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.660" end="00:32:51.930" style="s2">being driven he&#39;s not being motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.330" end="00:32:53.940" style="s2">his own particular theoretical bias all</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.930" end="00:32:56.520" style="s2">that being said what&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.940" end="00:33:01.830" style="s2">criticism well the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.520" end="00:33:04.020" style="s2">criticism is Right you have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.830" end="00:33:08.520" style="s2">distinction ultimately you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.020" end="00:33:17.310" style="s2">a distinction between implication right</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.520" end="00:33:19.980" style="s2">and inference people sometimes confuse</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.310" end="00:33:23.700" style="s2">these together so implication is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.980" end="00:33:26.310" style="s2">logical relationship based on syntactic</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.700" end="00:33:29.030" style="s2">structures and rules a logical</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.310" end="00:33:31.860" style="s2">relationship between propositions so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.030" end="00:33:34.980" style="s2">here&#39;s an abstract symbol so if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:37.410" style="s2">and B and I know that&#39;s true I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.980" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">conclude that B is true I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.410" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">what B is C I don&#39;t have any semantic</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:49.260" style="s2">content it is purely syntactic but I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:52.800" style="s2">derive that now when we try to think</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.260" end="00:33:57.030" style="s2">about implications what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.800" end="00:34:01.080" style="s2">remember is an inference is when you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.030" end="00:34:06.150" style="s2">actually using an implication relation</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.080" end="00:34:09.110" style="s2">to change your beliefs okay the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.150" end="00:34:12.659" style="s2">about beliefs is that they have content</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.110" end="00:34:15.659" style="s2">right so when I&#39;m making an inference</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.659" end="00:34:18.659" style="s2">I&#39;m not just making an implication I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.659" end="00:34:22.590" style="s2">using implication relations in order to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.659" end="00:34:24.629" style="s2">alter belief changing belief okay you</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:27.210" style="s2">say well why does that matter because</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.629" end="00:34:31.139" style="s2">changing believes to us brings up the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.210" end="00:34:34.230" style="s2">important issue right away right the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.139" end="00:34:38.100" style="s2">important issue right away is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.230" end="00:34:41.310" style="s2">beliefs should I be changing what</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.100" end="00:34:43.310" style="s2">beliefs should I be changing let me try</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.310" end="00:34:49.590" style="s2">and show you what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.310" end="00:34:52.260" style="s2">any proposition technically it&#39;s defined</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.590" end="00:34:54.810" style="s2">in terms of its logical syntactic</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.260" end="00:34:58.050" style="s2">structure by all of its implication</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.810" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">relations and depends on I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.050" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">just can get we can get very technical</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.690" style="s2">here about where whether or not negation</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:05.490" style="s2">and the implication or identical blah</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.690" end="00:35:07.830" style="s2">blah blah I&#39;m just going to speak very</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.490" end="00:35:11.210" style="s2">broadly here because that&#39;s all I need</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.830" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">so a proposition it&#39;s logical its</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.210" end="00:35:18.150" style="s2">computational identity is defined by all</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">of its implication relations to other</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.150" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2">propositions so for example part of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:30.060" style="s2">identity of this a and B is that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.600" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">implies B it also right implies a all</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.060" end="00:35:39.030" style="s2">kinds of things now the issue that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:44.460" style="s2">have and this is a point that was made</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.030" end="00:35:47.670" style="s2">also independently by chair niak is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.460" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">number of implications logical relations</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.670" end="00:35:53.190" style="s2">between any proposition and all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:57.950" style="s2">other propositions is combinatorially</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.190" end="00:36:03.030" style="s2">explosive and combinatorially explosive</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.950" end="00:36:04.530" style="s2">you cannot ever make use of and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.030" end="00:36:08.070" style="s2">talked about this in one how you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.530" end="00:36:10.230" style="s2">be comprehensively logical right you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.070" end="00:36:12.630" style="s2">can&#39;t make use of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.230" end="00:36:15.840" style="s2">implications of any proposition ever you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.630" end="00:36:19.320" style="s2">cannot be completely logical ever what</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.840" end="00:36:23.790" style="s2">you do is out of all of the implications</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.320" end="00:36:28.020" style="s2">you decide which one of the ones you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.790" end="00:36:34.950" style="s2">select right which one of the ones are</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.020" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">going to be used in an inference right</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:44.490" style="s2">talked about this as a kind of cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.490" end="00:36:50.750" style="s2">you going to commit to and this matters</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.460" end="00:36:53.550" style="s2">to you it matters to you because</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.750" end="00:36:56.730" style="s2">commitment is an act that makes use of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.550" end="00:37:00.660" style="s2">your precious and limited resources</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.730" end="00:37:12.330" style="s2">inferences that are not and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.380" end="00:37:15.030" style="s2">you knew I was going to say relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.330" end="00:37:16.830" style="s2">the context which beliefs do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.030" end="00:37:18.300" style="s2">change and that can mean strengthened by</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.300" end="00:37:23.810" style="s2">change with right in this context so</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">notice what out of all of these what am</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.010" end="00:37:34.530" style="s2">i doing I&#39;m choosing and this is what</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.830" end="00:37:50.190" style="s2">makes you intelligent as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.930" end="00:37:52.770" style="s2">agent is right that you select out of</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.770" end="00:37:57.450" style="s2">relevant ones because those ones are</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.110" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">relevant to the context because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.450" end="00:38:01.470" style="s2">going to affect the beliefs that you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.840" end="00:38:23.960" style="s2">well but I can get around that because</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.720" end="00:38:26.310" style="s2">logic you know logic isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.960" end="00:38:28.590" style="s2">implications it&#39;s the rules governing</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.310" end="00:38:32.040" style="s2">the implications and maybe all I need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.590" end="00:38:34.650" style="s2">talk about is the rules and then here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.040" end="00:38:36.180" style="s2">the argument that comes from Vic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.650" end="00:38:37.800" style="s2">Stein but I think ultimately goes back</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.800" end="00:38:47.850" style="s2">is how rules work right and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.600" end="00:38:54.050" style="s2">argument that Brown and others have made</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.850" end="00:38:54.050" style="s2">made very very clear rules</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.110" end="00:38:59.770" style="s2">rules are obviously there propositions</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.770" end="00:39:02.590" style="s2">propositions that and this is perhaps</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.290" end="00:39:13.570" style="s2">with that is that of course every rule</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.120" end="00:39:16.300" style="s2">requires an interpretation every rule</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.570" end="00:39:19.030" style="s2">requires a specification in its</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.819" end="00:47:43.589" style="s2">look for it and notice it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.099" end="00:47:47.340" style="s2">give us a way of connecting and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.589" end="00:47:51.110" style="s2">about the four kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.340" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">what about modularity what about</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.110" end="00:48:00.499" style="s2">modularity well</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:04.579" style="s2">the idea would be something like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.499" end="00:48:06.589" style="s2">right and and to be fair this comes up a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.579" end="00:48:10.279" style="s2">lot the idea you know here&#39;s the mind or</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.589" end="00:48:13.579" style="s2">the brain right here&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.279" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">here&#39;s the central executive or</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.579" end="00:48:18.619" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s weird we use a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">business term for an aspect of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.619" end="00:48:23.420" style="s2">cognition this is used in psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:25.039" style="s2">the idea is that central executive is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.420" end="00:48:27.170" style="s2">making all kinds of important decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.039" end="00:48:29.239" style="s2">well maybe the central executive is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.170" end="00:48:33.140" style="s2">responsible for relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.239" end="00:48:34.339" style="s2">and and and and a lot of people and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.140" end="00:48:35.749" style="s2">know this because I interact with</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.339" end="00:48:37.009" style="s2">psychologists there so oh yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.749" end="00:48:41.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the answer well it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.009" end="00:48:43.099" style="s2">answer it&#39;s not an answer at all because</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.180" end="00:48:45.319" style="s2">if it&#39;s right it&#39;s ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.099" end="00:48:48.529" style="s2">homunculus what does the central</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.319" end="00:48:50.329" style="s2">executive have to possess inside the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.529" end="00:48:51.710" style="s2">central executive is a capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.710" end="00:48:57.710" style="s2">explained it I&#39;ve just pointed to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.979" end="00:48:58.849" style="s2">place the problem is you shouldn&#39;t okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.710" end="00:49:00.710" style="s2">so first of all I haven&#39;t explained it</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.849" end="00:49:02.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a marketer and secondly you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.710" end="00:49:05.029" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t point to a place look</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.660" end="00:49:07.819" style="s2">relevance realization can&#39;t be in any</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.029" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">one place it has to simultaneously you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.819" end="00:49:12.109" style="s2">know this we&#39;ve talked about this with</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:14.329" style="s2">how attention works remember you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.109" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re always going from feature to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.329" end="00:49:18.619" style="s2">Gestalt and from Gestalt to feature</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:20.599" style="s2">attention has to be moving out towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.619" end="00:49:22.519" style="s2">the gestalt and down to the features</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.599" end="00:49:24.829" style="s2">relevance realization has to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.519" end="00:49:26.660" style="s2">happening both at the feature level and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.829" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">the Gestalt level in an highly</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.660" end="00:49:32.029" style="s2">integrated interactive fashion you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.859" style="s2">point to one place and say that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.029" end="00:49:36.739" style="s2">relevance realization is going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.859" end="00:49:38.690" style="s2">because relevance realization has to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.739" end="00:49:41.650" style="s2">happening at multiple levels of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.690" end="00:49:45.049" style="s2">cognition in a simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.650" end="00:49:51.079" style="s2">self-organizing fashion that&#39;s why it it</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.049" end="00:49:52.849" style="s2">it can lead to insight and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.079" end="00:49:54.979" style="s2">pointing to any one thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.849" end="00:50:00.109" style="s2">labeling it is not an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.979" end="00:50:04.690" style="s2">it is a homunculus right it&#39;s a home</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.109" end="00:50:04.690" style="s2">ocular diversion that&#39;s all it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.620" end="00:50:12.210" style="s2">okay let&#39;s try and draw this all</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.770" end="00:50:13.170" style="s2">together what are we learning well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.210" end="00:50:14.520" style="s2">trying to show you we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.170" end="00:50:17.570" style="s2">learning something very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.520" end="00:50:17.570" style="s2">about meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.470" end="00:50:25.800" style="s2">but we&#39;re learning what we need the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.220" end="00:50:27.270" style="s2">kinds of properties and processes we</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.800" end="00:50:30.990" style="s2">need in order to explain relevance</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.270" end="00:50:33.330" style="s2">realization first of all our account of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.990" end="00:50:34.590" style="s2">relevance realization and bear with me</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.330" end="00:50:38.060" style="s2">on this because there&#39;s an important way</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.590" end="00:50:40.740" style="s2">in which I&#39;m going to modify this right</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.060" end="00:50:42.330" style="s2">but are an account irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.740" end="00:50:48.030" style="s2">realization has to be completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.330" end="00:50:53.010" style="s2">internal now what do I mean by that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.030" end="00:50:55.320" style="s2">has to work in terms of goals that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.010" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">at least initially are internal to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.320" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">brain and emerge developmentally from it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.660" end="00:51:04.460" style="s2">why look any goal in which that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">which the brain is representing or</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.460" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">referring to something in the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.250" end="00:51:19.080" style="s2">can&#39;t be the place where we can generate</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.940" end="00:51:22.350" style="s2">an explanation of relevance because</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.080" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">insofar as I&#39;m representing a goal to</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.350" end="00:51:28.740" style="s2">myself I&#39;ve already got the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.900" style="s2">relevance realization the goals that are</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.980" end="00:51:43.140" style="s2">does that mean the goals have to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.070" end="00:51:45.150" style="s2">goals that are constitutive what a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.140" end="00:51:47.370" style="s2">constitutive goals constitutive goals</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.150" end="00:51:49.410" style="s2">are goals that a system or process have</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.370" end="00:51:52.350" style="s2">that help to constitute it for being</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.410" end="00:51:56.370" style="s2">what it is and this is especially the</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.370" end="00:52:03.540" style="s2">talked about this living things are not</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.540" end="00:52:07.470" style="s2">self organized because they have the</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:39.990" style="s2">deep connection between your ability to</p>

<p begin="00:52:52.950" end="00:52:57.329" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.420" end="00:53:05.910" style="s2">between the doing relevance realization</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:14.099" style="s2">internal relevance theory of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.660" end="00:53:16.500" style="s2">realization has to talk in terms of</p>
