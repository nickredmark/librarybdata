<p begin="00:01:44.800" end="00:01:52.300" style="s2">for about two and a quarter years now</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.340" end="00:01:55.990" style="s2">and this month I decided to do something</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.300" end="00:01:59.170" style="s2">a little bit differently I built a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.990" end="00:02:01.030" style="s2">pandemic 2020 guide trying to get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.170" end="00:02:05.740" style="s2">you know the kind of standard news that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.030" end="00:02:07.930" style="s2">you hear or see and digging into some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.740" end="00:02:09.909" style="s2">the you know frameworks that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.930" end="00:02:10.899" style="s2">actually make it more comprehensible to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.909" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.899" end="00:02:15.519" style="s2">kind of looking a little bit beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:17.650" style="s2">horizon if I could in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.519" end="00:02:20.049" style="s2">corona virus and the global pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.650" end="00:02:21.819" style="s2">those shoes were correct correct and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.049" end="00:02:23.560" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting approach for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.819" end="00:02:25.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of an open source right</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.560" end="00:02:27.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen that there are people placing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.480" end="00:02:29.409" style="s2">comments and stuff and you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.790" end="00:02:33.129" style="s2">collaborating with your subscribers yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.409" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">yep I put it into a Google Doc and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.129" end="00:02:37.959" style="s2">shared the link with my my supporters</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:41.140" style="s2">and and they&#39;re providing me feedback</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.959" end="00:02:43.420" style="s2">and insight there it&#39;s a pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.140" end="00:02:46.120" style="s2">cool group of folks I mean you know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.420" end="00:02:49.959" style="s2">have financial insight they have medical</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.120" end="00:02:52.090" style="s2">insight they have you know insight in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.959" end="00:02:54.459" style="s2">terms of emergency response it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.090" end="00:02:57.069" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty good group to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.459" end="00:02:58.420" style="s2">tap into and they you know if I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.069" end="00:03:00.069" style="s2">something wrong and they&#39;ll point it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.420" end="00:03:02.290" style="s2">or the correct it or they amend it or</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.069" end="00:03:04.769" style="s2">add a little bit to it it makes it kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.290" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">of a very cool living document that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.769" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">people can use as a reference source</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:13.659" style="s2">yeah and this is a very good example of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:15.400" style="s2">collaborative sense making and open</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.659" end="00:03:16.870" style="s2">source intelligence gathering and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.400" end="00:03:20.919" style="s2">think that you and I both have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.870" end="00:03:22.900" style="s2">interested in focused on how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.919" end="00:03:25.030" style="s2">individually and collectively as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.900" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">networks and groups increase our sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.030" end="00:03:30.129" style="s2">making capabilities and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">this is an excellent example of how the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.129" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">power of a network can come together to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:38.410" style="s2">help not only the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.209" end="00:03:40.900" style="s2">contributing but then the readers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.410" end="00:03:42.730" style="s2">then your audience at large to so how do</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.900" end="00:03:46.780" style="s2">you see that as it fits into sort of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.730" end="00:03:49.959" style="s2">general war on you know confusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.780" end="00:03:51.549" style="s2">information disinformation etc and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.959" end="00:03:53.440" style="s2">sort of building those capacities for</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.549" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">sense making yeah I mean there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.440" end="00:04:00.190" style="s2">articles out there that point out that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more false content being</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.190" end="00:04:05.500" style="s2">distributed fake content spun content</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:09.419" style="s2">and I don&#39;t really see that as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.500" end="00:04:12.099" style="s2">I mean because I don&#39;t really think as</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.419" end="00:04:14.590" style="s2">an individual anymore I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.099" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">in terms of a my network helping me</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.590" end="00:04:21.410" style="s2">think through things so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:23.330" style="s2">if I find something that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.410" end="00:04:26.030" style="s2">credible and I think is interesting I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.330" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">post it on one of my different feeds and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.030" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">my network will tell me whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:31.760" style="s2">it is there&#39;s somebody on the network</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:32.660" style="s2">that that has more insight into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.760" end="00:04:34.610" style="s2">issue than I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.660" end="00:04:36.110" style="s2">and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll set me</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.610" end="00:04:40.180" style="s2">straight which is great because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.110" end="00:04:43.190" style="s2">means I&#39;m I&#39;m not just one brain I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:45.139" style="s2">thousands of brains you know I&#39;m as good</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.190" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">as the quality of my network in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.139" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">words right which is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">point you know after we talked in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:57.110" style="s2">March and my conversation is also back</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">then with Jordan Hall they helped me so</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:01.490" style="s2">come up with the idea for the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:02.750" style="s2">order and the liminal order is working</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.490" end="00:05:05.780" style="s2">very much the same way that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:08.330" style="s2">described and in fact one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.780" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">the key lines in my sales pitch for</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:12.169" style="s2">people is that we&#39;re only going to be as</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:15.530" style="s2">powerful as our network moving into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.169" end="00:05:17.450" style="s2">future and this is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.530" end="00:05:19.430" style="s2">example because in the liminal order as</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.450" end="00:05:22.220" style="s2">well we have a dedicated coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.430" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">room and we&#39;ve had about 30 guys doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.220" end="00:05:28.190" style="s2">you know just 24/7 open source Intel</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">work guys from finance and health care</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.190" end="00:05:33.050" style="s2">and and health professionals doctors</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">investors people who are experts in</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.050" end="00:05:37.850" style="s2">trade and global logistics and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.860" style="s2">and yeah we have just been collecting</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.850" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">information from all over the world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.860" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">it put us we think really far ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:47.810" style="s2">the curve and people have been in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">defensive financial positions and being</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.810" end="00:05:51.560" style="s2">very aggressive with their their health</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">and the contact that they&#39;re making with</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:57.010" style="s2">other people in in preparation and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.650" end="00:05:59.479" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s fascinating to me to see how</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.010" end="00:06:01.700" style="s2">those conversations that we had a year</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.479" end="00:06:03.710" style="s2">ago actually led into something very</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.700" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">productive that&#39;s working in the model</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.710" end="00:06:08.840" style="s2">that you&#39;ve laid out and others towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:11.510" style="s2">being individuals being only as strong</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.840" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">as their networks and so congratulations</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.510" end="00:06:15.710" style="s2">to you and and I find it personally just</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:17.390" style="s2">fascinating and I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve been putting out</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.390" end="00:06:22.580" style="s2">and so I wanted to dive in actually I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:24.229" style="s2">want to dive into the the corona for</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.580" end="00:06:25.850" style="s2">sure but I want to back up just a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.229" end="00:06:28.070" style="s2">bit because I know we can get bogged</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.850" end="00:06:29.539" style="s2">down with the corona stuff and yep one</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.070" end="00:06:32.450" style="s2">one of the things I wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.539" end="00:06:34.970" style="s2">before we got to Corona details</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.450" end="00:06:37.820" style="s2">was your report about the sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.970" end="00:06:40.190" style="s2">cities and what I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.820" end="00:06:44.300" style="s2">about your analysis there was that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.190" end="00:06:45.560" style="s2">was not left only a right only and I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.300" end="00:06:48.260" style="s2">wondering if you could sort of describe</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.560" end="00:06:50.180" style="s2">for the listeners you know that report</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.260" end="00:06:52.340" style="s2">but specifically around the Second</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.180" end="00:06:54.680" style="s2">Amendment stuff and the immigration</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.340" end="00:06:57.260" style="s2">stuff so if you could explain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.680" end="00:06:59.660" style="s2">the the decentralized you know effect</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.260" end="00:07:01.370" style="s2">that&#39;s happening and relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.660" end="00:07:05.450" style="s2">sanctuary cities in our federal state</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.370" end="00:07:10.419" style="s2">and federalism etc okay well um the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.450" end="00:07:13.130" style="s2">is that you know as we globalize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.419" end="00:07:15.350" style="s2">legitimacy of the nation-state in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.130" end="00:07:17.720" style="s2">case the United States is diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.350" end="00:07:19.190" style="s2">particularly as it screws up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.720" end="00:07:21.890" style="s2">the things associated with globalization</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.190" end="00:07:24.110" style="s2">is screwed up 9/11 by in by invading</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.890" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">Iraq and it and deleted a bit deal</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.110" end="00:07:30.580" style="s2">legitimize itself by promoting WMDs and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:33.890" style="s2">not being able to successfully conclude</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.580" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">Afghanistan for example and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.890" end="00:07:39.290" style="s2">know the financial crisis in again a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:40.790" style="s2">goal lies financial system having its</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.290" end="00:07:42.130" style="s2">way with us and in not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.790" end="00:07:45.650" style="s2">handle the aftermath of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.130" end="00:07:50.810" style="s2">successfully by punishing the fraud that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.650" end="00:07:56.410" style="s2">was rife in the system and states and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.810" end="00:08:00.440" style="s2">localities are trying to find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.410" end="00:08:04.510" style="s2">adapt to that deficit and they have more</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.440" end="00:08:07.870" style="s2">legitimacy than the nation does and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.510" end="00:08:10.729" style="s2">that&#39;s cropped up in a couple places</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.870" end="00:08:14.600" style="s2">there&#39;s the sanctuary cities movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.729" end="00:08:17.710" style="s2">began on the immigration side and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.600" end="00:08:21.020" style="s2">from the left in terms of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.710" end="00:08:24.020" style="s2">undermine any kind of immigration</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.020" end="00:08:28.150" style="s2">enforcement and there were ways of doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.020" end="00:08:31.330" style="s2">that and a most successful way was to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.150" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">exploit the loophole exploit the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.330" end="00:08:36.979" style="s2">federal systems approach to enforcing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:38.450" style="s2">they they use civil laws instead of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.979" end="00:08:44.930" style="s2">criminal laws because they&#39;re easier to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.450" end="00:08:45.800" style="s2">to move forward with in court and civil</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.930" end="00:08:49.550" style="s2">laws can</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.800" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">be ignored by the the states they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.550" end="00:08:53.959" style="s2">have they&#39;re not obligated to act as it</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">would be if it was a a criminal</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.959" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">enforcement action taken against an</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:09:01.160" style="s2">illegal immigrant um and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">they were able to you know pump up the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.160" end="00:09:09.339" style="s2">idea that immigrants in California and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:12.890" style="s2">Chicago and other places can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.339" end="00:09:16.100" style="s2">detained because of that kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.890" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">kind of constitutional right that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.100" end="00:09:22.850" style="s2">have not to be unlawfully detained and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">and that&#39;s been pretty successful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.850" end="00:09:26.450" style="s2">spread across the country there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">of places to have it there&#39;s been a kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.450" end="00:09:34.970" style="s2">of a an opposite movement from the from</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:37.399" style="s2">the federal side to empower states and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.970" end="00:09:40.040" style="s2">counties to actively enforce on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.399" end="00:09:42.709" style="s2">federal government&#39;s behalf immigration</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.040" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">law kind of deputize them in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.709" end="00:09:46.490" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t normally be</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:49.310" style="s2">deputized or you know capable of acting</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.490" end="00:09:53.500" style="s2">so kind of a counterweight and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.310" end="00:09:53.500" style="s2">that kind of template then served as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.649" end="00:10:00.050" style="s2">way to radically expand the the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:01.430" style="s2">amendment protests right basically said</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.050" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">hey man if that&#39;s working sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.430" end="00:10:07.940" style="s2">cities is working you know it lets us</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.220" end="00:10:09.649" style="s2">apply to Second Amendment issues and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.940" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">have a constitutional issue that that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.649" end="00:10:15.380" style="s2">feel is not being improperly handled by</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">the federal government and it took off</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.380" end="00:10:19.750" style="s2">throughout Illinois and then it went</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">into Virginia and now it&#39;s gone national</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.750" end="00:10:29.000" style="s2">and again you see this state and and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:32.360" style="s2">local level</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:34.570" style="s2">kind of disregard for federal law</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.360" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">I mean basically they won&#39;t enforce it</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.570" end="00:10:39.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s not so much excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:41.779" style="s2">are there precedents for this I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:45.920" style="s2">seems to me that it&#39;s like wow I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.779" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">we&#39;re disregarding federal law to me you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.920" end="00:10:51.199" style="s2">know if you sort of a non contextual</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.579" style="s2">analysis of that would say well you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.199" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">the federal government&#39;s falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.579" end="00:10:56.390" style="s2">we can&#39;t even enforce federal laws or</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:58.730" style="s2">protect federal civil liberties is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.390" end="00:11:01.670" style="s2">a is this a new phenomenon where</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.730" end="00:11:06.590" style="s2">local jurisdictions are just saying no</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.670" end="00:11:08.960" style="s2">to the federal government in the last 40</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.590" end="00:11:10.340" style="s2">or 50 years yeah but I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.960" end="00:11:14.630" style="s2">always been kind of a struggle between</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.340" end="00:11:16.220" style="s2">the states and the feds all right you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.630" end="00:11:16.780" style="s2">see a lot of this though prior to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.220" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">Civil War</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.780" end="00:11:21.140" style="s2">in terms of enforcement of what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:22.130" style="s2">Supreme Court was saying what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.140" end="00:11:25.520" style="s2">federal government was saying in terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.130" end="00:11:27.530" style="s2">of how how slavery should be handled so</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.520" end="00:11:29.030" style="s2">there was a go ahead it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.530" end="00:11:30.770" style="s2">interesting to me because I want to I</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.030" end="00:11:33.410" style="s2">want to at one hand criticize the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.770" end="00:11:36.380" style="s2">sanctuary you know locality of sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.410" end="00:11:38.390" style="s2">cities and counties for for their</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.380" end="00:11:40.550" style="s2">actions but then at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.390" end="00:11:42.920" style="s2">haven&#39;t fully support the Second</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.550" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">Amendment sanctuaries and their</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.920" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">disregard for the mandates from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:50.210" style="s2">federal level so it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:52.610" style="s2">interesting place to put yourself sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.210" end="00:11:55.940" style="s2">of tactically I guess where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.610" end="00:11:57.710" style="s2">really criticize the sanctuary cities on</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.940" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">immigration well the same time</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.710" end="00:12:02.930" style="s2">championing the Second Amendment guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.530" end="00:12:05.720" style="s2">but but either way this is an example of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.930" end="00:12:07.670" style="s2">how this the power that was centralized</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.720" end="00:12:09.170" style="s2">in Washington seems to be wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.670" end="00:12:11.090" style="s2">being wrestled back by it by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.170" end="00:12:13.910" style="s2">localities is this a trend you think</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.090" end="00:12:15.620" style="s2">gonna gonna continue and and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.910" end="00:12:16.970" style="s2">being driven by I think you know we both</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.620" end="00:12:19.340" style="s2">know the answer but I&#39;d love to just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.970" end="00:12:20.870" style="s2">explore it a little bit what is it what</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.340" end="00:12:24.490" style="s2">is it being driven by and and where is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.870" end="00:12:27.050" style="s2">it going what is this gonna lead to well</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.490" end="00:12:30.200" style="s2">all of this really cropped up after the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.050" end="00:12:32.870" style="s2">end of the Cold War and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.200" end="00:12:34.340" style="s2">unanimity and singularity of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.870" end="00:12:38.060" style="s2">that we had during the Cold War in order</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.340" end="00:12:39.890" style="s2">to win it was no longer needed</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.060" end="00:12:41.270" style="s2">you know the extraordinary measures that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.890" end="00:12:43.820" style="s2">would you know the extraordinary powers</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.270" end="00:12:47.450" style="s2">that we gave the federal government in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.820" end="00:12:50.870" style="s2">deference we gave them in order to when</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.450" end="00:12:53.180" style="s2">that conflict was no longer justified</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.870" end="00:12:55.250" style="s2">and the states are starting to do what</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.180" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">they used to do and they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.250" end="00:13:01.430" style="s2">diverge and getting back to where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.910" end="00:13:03.020" style="s2">u.s. spent the first 150 years of its</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.430" end="00:13:04.550" style="s2">history is in this kind of grand</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.020" end="00:13:06.140" style="s2">experiment where there&#39;s thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.550" end="00:13:09.530" style="s2">different experiments going on and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.140" end="00:13:11.540" style="s2">to live and that&#39;s that&#39;s unsettling to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.530" end="00:13:14.300" style="s2">a you know kind of our modern</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.540" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">kind of way of thinking of things in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.300" end="00:13:18.650" style="s2">terms of this like singular strong</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.860" end="00:13:27.110" style="s2">actually that this divergence is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:29.720" style="s2">actually good because you really none</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.110" end="00:13:31.250" style="s2">none of us know how best to live in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.720" end="00:13:33.110" style="s2">modern world and having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.250" end="00:13:36.260" style="s2">different experiments going on at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.110" end="00:13:37.930" style="s2">same time is is a good thing right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.260" end="00:13:40.280" style="s2">we talked about before about how the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.930" end="00:13:43.190" style="s2">complexity of the modern age you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.280" end="00:13:45.080" style="s2">makes both expertise and acting like</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.080" end="00:13:49.190" style="s2">know implying that you have an answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.280" end="00:13:50.900" style="s2">one person or even one you know small</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:53.660" style="s2">cabal people that that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.900" end="00:13:56.450" style="s2">nonsense and out the window I remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.660" end="00:13:58.730" style="s2">we discussed before about how it has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.450" end="00:14:00.640" style="s2">really be an iterative process of almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.730" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">trial and error and I guess by having</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.640" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">independent networks across the country</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:08.750" style="s2">giving things a run and seeing how it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:10.790" style="s2">works and you know sort of testing new</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.750" end="00:14:12.680" style="s2">ground in the long run you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.790" end="00:14:15.010" style="s2">going to be a healthy thing for the for</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:18.410" style="s2">the Union or do you think that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.010" end="00:14:20.060" style="s2">we&#39;re on divergent paths that this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.410" end="00:14:21.530" style="s2">this new process is only gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.060" end="00:14:23.570" style="s2">accelerate especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.530" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">technology involved right well I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.570" end="00:14:28.130" style="s2">we we have a flexible document in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:31.550" style="s2">Constitution and it can allow us a great</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.130" end="00:14:34.940" style="s2">degree of flexibility in how we move</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.550" end="00:14:37.130" style="s2">forward you know this is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.940" end="00:14:39.410" style="s2">generalized model for handling complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.130" end="00:14:41.030" style="s2">problems with me we live in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.410" end="00:14:45.460" style="s2">world it&#39;s different than complicated</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.030" end="00:14:47.690" style="s2">complicated is more engineering specific</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.460" end="00:14:49.730" style="s2">solutions you know where we have all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.690" end="00:14:51.410" style="s2">factors and we know how to engineer a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.730" end="00:14:53.690" style="s2">solution and we can we can build it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.410" end="00:14:56.120" style="s2">using a Barak bureaucracy and plan for</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.690" end="00:14:59.660" style="s2">future events using a bureaucracy when</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.120" end="00:15:01.700" style="s2">you get to complex things change</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.660" end="00:15:03.770" style="s2">constantly and the plans that you had in</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.700" end="00:15:05.570" style="s2">place or the system that you just built</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.770" end="00:15:10.970" style="s2">can be obsolete at the moment you ship</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.570" end="00:15:13.160" style="s2">it and if you restrict your your options</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.970" end="00:15:14.540" style="s2">just just one or two expert solutions</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.160" end="00:15:18.860" style="s2">you won&#39;t have the one that actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.540" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">works for this new situation and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.860" end="00:15:23.000" style="s2">know when you&#39;re doing this at a company</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">level what you want you know you have it</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.000" end="00:15:28.350" style="s2">facing a complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">market environment and you have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.350" end="00:15:33.330" style="s2">expert solutions and they they main may</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:35.430" style="s2">or not may or may not work what you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.330" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">do is open it up to the employees and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.430" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">and the ones that gained a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:43.050" style="s2">traction you know have kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:45.779" style="s2">hub sup as a port for them are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.050" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">you want to trial and not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.779" end="00:15:49.500" style="s2">brainstorming things that go up on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:51.029" style="s2">wall but I mean the solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.500" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">actually gain some kind of traction with</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.029" end="00:15:55.410" style="s2">employees as a solution for this problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.860" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">and we&#39;re kind of doing that at a macro</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.410" end="00:16:00.420" style="s2">micro scale with states and localities</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:03.060" style="s2">going in their own direction trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.420" end="00:16:05.160" style="s2">find the the best way to not only</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.060" end="00:16:07.890" style="s2">survive in this environment this complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.160" end="00:16:09.320" style="s2">environment but to thrive right I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.890" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">been reading a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.320" end="00:16:14.190" style="s2">industrial organization and the future</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:16.200" style="s2">of professional work and the author&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.190" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">name is escaping me right now but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.200" end="00:16:21.770" style="s2">think he had similar ideas I think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">book is called like reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.770" end="00:16:27.770" style="s2">organizations or something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:30.360" style="s2">he had ideas about how work should be</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.770" end="00:16:32.640" style="s2">sort of atomized down to smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.360" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">smaller group levels with with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.640" end="00:16:37.650" style="s2">general mandates and then allow each of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:39.270" style="s2">the small pockets of employees to figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.650" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">out what works best and then they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.270" end="00:16:43.500" style="s2">then you know select from best practices</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:44.820" style="s2">there which which reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.500" end="00:16:47.100" style="s2">something that you wrote about in your</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.820" end="00:16:50.459" style="s2">one of your reports on China and talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.100" end="00:16:53.070" style="s2">about how that the answers to these</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.459" end="00:16:56.339" style="s2">complex problems are on the in the edges</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.070" end="00:16:59.100" style="s2">and in the edge cases yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.339" end="00:17:02.520" style="s2">unfortunately also on the edge is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.100" end="00:17:05.040" style="s2">closest to can to chaos right so in some</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.520" end="00:17:08.970" style="s2">ways we have to facilitate and expect</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.040" end="00:17:10.589" style="s2">chaos how does that work here in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.970" end="00:17:12.540" style="s2">United States is that working for us how</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.589" end="00:17:15.179" style="s2">is that working in China what what have</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.540" end="00:17:17.550" style="s2">you seen as relates to you know needing</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.179" end="00:17:19.860" style="s2">needing to have people on the edge edge</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.550" end="00:17:22.230" style="s2">cases in order to come up with solutions</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.860" end="00:17:24.510" style="s2">for complex problems well I mean we saw</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.230" end="00:17:27.720" style="s2">a pretty amazing example of that with</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.510" end="00:17:31.020" style="s2">China and the coronavirus so the during</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.720" end="00:17:33.210" style="s2">the first month when doctors were</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.020" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">discovering you know infected cases and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.210" end="00:17:37.180" style="s2">getting infected themselves they tried</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.940" style="s2">to raise the alarm</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.180" end="00:17:42.280" style="s2">and they were shut down in the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.940" end="00:17:43.870" style="s2">government the local governments in</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.280" end="00:17:46.570" style="s2">particular were the ones who are saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.870" end="00:17:49.750" style="s2">hey if you talk about this we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.570" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">put you in jail and locked him up and by</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.750" end="00:17:56.230" style="s2">the time the virus got you know got to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:57.820" style="s2">level where it was picking up attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.230" end="00:17:58.270" style="s2">at the national level it was out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.820" end="00:18:01.420" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.270" end="00:18:03.700" style="s2">and you know all those people died as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.420" end="00:18:05.740" style="s2">result of that and we have a global</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.700" end="00:18:09.550" style="s2">pandemic as a result of not being able</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.740" end="00:18:11.680" style="s2">to have those kind of edge voices and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.550" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">the States we&#39;re saying it it you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.680" end="00:18:16.900" style="s2">in an interesting way with the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:20.440" style="s2">discussing solutions to the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.900" end="00:18:22.090" style="s2">right now is it&#39;s very chaotic but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.440" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">of information is being developed and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.090" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">discovered the whole problem space is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:29.740" style="s2">being unearthed there&#39;s some and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.200" style="s2">disinformation out there but that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.740" end="00:18:35.860" style="s2">it usually is debunked if we think as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.200" end="00:18:37.390" style="s2">network right there&#39;s some expert or</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.860" end="00:18:38.680" style="s2">somebody who has some insight that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.390" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">probably debunk something that comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.680" end="00:18:44.740" style="s2">across your your feed that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:46.810" style="s2">wrong and then we&#39;re we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:50.020" style="s2">running a decentralized response right</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.810" end="00:18:51.400" style="s2">now right and it will find out what</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.020" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t work in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.400" end="00:18:57.010" style="s2">mitigation space I think that&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:59.080" style="s2">robust way of doing it because that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.010" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">might get it wrong if you did it in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.080" end="00:19:02.440" style="s2">centralized maybe the quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:05.740" style="s2">approach is actually the bad way to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.440" end="00:19:07.390" style="s2">it interesting so what role does the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.740" end="00:19:09.340" style="s2">central government what role does Donald</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.390" end="00:19:12.280" style="s2">Trump have in this I think people have</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.340" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">been criticizing him for like taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.280" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">sort of the I remember when George Bush</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:18.010" style="s2">after 9/11 was like everything is fine</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:19.870" style="s2">just go shopping right right and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.010" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">Trump&#39;s like hey it&#39;s just a flu don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.870" end="00:19:24.100" style="s2">worry not a lot of people are gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:27.370" style="s2">everything&#39;s gonna be okay what what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.100" end="00:19:29.320" style="s2">what becomes the role of the figure the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.370" end="00:19:31.210" style="s2">you know the leader of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.320" end="00:19:34.060" style="s2">centralized effort that there is right</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.210" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">at the federal government right when at</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.060" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">the same time this the answers that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:40.810" style="s2">being sourced in an open source</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.250" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">environment and networked environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.810" end="00:19:44.830" style="s2">like we have here great well I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.320" style="s2">on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.830" end="00:19:49.000" style="s2">kind of an idea as to what should be</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.660" end="00:23:53.070" style="s2">that was a real hit to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.030" end="00:23:55.430" style="s2">me in that you know the lending stopped</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.070" end="00:23:58.050" style="s2">and the the velocity slowed and</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.370" end="00:24:05.910" style="s2">to me felt like yeah there was a global</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.470" end="00:24:08.820" style="s2">crisis but it also was like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.910" end="00:24:11.310" style="s2">fundamental economic issue right is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.820" end="00:24:13.890" style="s2">the this to me seems like an outlier</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.310" end="00:24:17.820" style="s2">event that&#39;s not actually representative</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.890" end="00:24:19.920" style="s2">of the economic fundamentals am I wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.820" end="00:24:22.980" style="s2">in thinking that something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.920" end="00:24:26.940" style="s2">processed or I think I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.980" end="00:24:29.550" style="s2">thing that unites all three events is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.940" end="00:24:31.140" style="s2">that it&#39;s based on uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.550" end="00:24:34.800" style="s2">uncertainty is like poison it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.140" end="00:24:37.110" style="s2">that the most aggressive acid on any</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.800" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">kind of investment in confidence and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.110" end="00:24:40.790" style="s2">confidence is the thing that drives</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.770" end="00:29:30.620" style="s2">right now can go to different directions</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.950" end="00:29:32.290" style="s2">we could end up in a quarantine which I</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.620" end="00:29:35.990" style="s2">don&#39;t think is going to happen give us a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.290" end="00:29:37.580" style="s2">the way the feds are running it which</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.990" end="00:29:41.150" style="s2">that sound virtually all economic</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.660" end="00:29:50.600" style="s2">national like it they did in Italy the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.250" end="00:29:52.850" style="s2">other option is that they keeps on</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:55.070" style="s2">running in and we see shuts downs at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.850" end="00:29:59.419" style="s2">local level and those continue and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.070" end="00:30:03.380" style="s2">basically all schools go online you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.419" end="00:30:05.299" style="s2">I&#39;ll travel across to a stop all of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.380" end="00:30:08.540" style="s2">kind of activity that we normally see in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.299" end="00:30:13.610" style="s2">the the economic system dries up and</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.890" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">that is I I do know that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.660" end="00:30:29.800" style="s2">horrific</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:31.990" style="s2">and I don&#39;t haven&#39;t seen any modeling</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">mean this is a I mean this cut the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.630" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">interesting thing about this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:45.850" style="s2">pandemic is it it&#39;s not just like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:47.590" style="s2">know the Spanish flu and how its spread</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.890" end="00:31:03.640" style="s2">you lift at quarantine it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:06.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a wild thing and and because</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.640" end="00:31:10.620" style="s2">it&#39;s unique you know a modern economy</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.610" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">experiencing this kind of event raises a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.620" end="00:31:17.110" style="s2">the situation to a level of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:18.370" style="s2">has to be it&#39;s a suppressive of economic</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.110" end="00:31:20.020" style="s2">activity you can see already in the</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.020" end="00:31:25.630" style="s2">uncertainty is causing all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.670" end="00:31:27.190" style="s2">instability right I mean you could see</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.630" end="00:31:30.190" style="s2">it in the in the rate for the 30 year</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.190" end="00:31:32.710" style="s2">Treasury bond right I mean they expect</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.190" end="00:31:35.020" style="s2">us to do very very badly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.710" end="00:31:36.430" style="s2">expecting a 1% return over 30 years so</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.020" end="00:31:38.560" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the first time the yield</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.430" end="00:31:40.690" style="s2">curves ever been entirely under 1% as</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.560" end="00:31:43.660" style="s2">far as I understand it yep so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.690" end="00:31:46.120" style="s2">expectations of everybody is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.660" end="00:31:48.070" style="s2">gonna get clobbered and and we&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.520" end="00:32:01.330" style="s2">been pushed into the background and at</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.140" end="00:32:02.830" style="s2">this point now it&#39;s just like please</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.330" end="00:32:04.270" style="s2">everybody take all the money in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.830" end="00:32:06.280" style="s2">world and spend it and we still aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.270" end="00:32:09.400" style="s2">going to have any inflation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.280" end="00:32:12.570" style="s2">interesting to consider this current</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.400" end="00:32:15.280" style="s2">event in the context of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.570" end="00:32:17.380" style="s2">deflationary you know generation era</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.280" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">that were basically right like last 4050</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.380" end="00:32:21.250" style="s2">years but don&#39;t want spending it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:23.530" style="s2">that the crazy thing is that here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.250" end="00:32:25.180" style="s2">having people throw trillions at us tens</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.830" end="00:32:31.140" style="s2">on you know we have this kind of old</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.140" style="s2">model of thinking about</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.990" end="00:32:41.899" style="s2">like I mean if somebody offered me a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.659" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">trillion dollars a less than 1% as a you</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.100" end="00:33:18.409" style="s2">just it&#39;s just mind-boggling that the US</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.409" end="00:33:23.990" style="s2">dollars that will yield more than 1%</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.190" end="00:33:27.049" style="s2">right that that is sort of an insane</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.990" end="00:33:29.149" style="s2">thing to think and but this act trend</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.500" end="00:33:35.090" style="s2">sheets been carrying so much cash they</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.320" end="00:33:36.590" style="s2">don&#39;t even know where to put it and</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.590" end="00:33:40.610" style="s2">closest to what my metaphors are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.169" end="00:33:41.659" style="s2">mix up but that you&#39;re closest to the</p>

<p begin="00:33:41.659" end="00:33:44.779" style="s2">and they&#39;re the ones who are like</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.070" end="00:33:45.649" style="s2">feeling the pressure constantly to</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.750" end="00:33:55.549" style="s2">they they can&#39;t find a place to invest</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.370" end="00:33:56.750" style="s2">it so I&#39;m not entirely surprised that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.549" end="00:33:59.269" style="s2">the federal government can&#39;t figure that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.750" end="00:34:02.230" style="s2">out either but it does seem to me this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.269" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">would be a wonderful opportunity for a</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.869" end="00:34:23.690" style="s2">what happens at the federal level is</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.950" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">they start doling it out to the same you</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.520" end="00:35:11.270" style="s2">you have so we got all this lost money</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.069" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">in the system right now and it&#39;s just we</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.270" end="00:35:15.470" style="s2">put more and more and more of it every</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:18.369" style="s2">year into this kind of big casino slash</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.369" end="00:35:22.490" style="s2">well that&#39;s the only thing is doing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.569" end="00:35:24.109" style="s2">generating profits for Wall Street and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.490" end="00:35:26.420" style="s2">the guys that make oh yeah that make all</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.109" end="00:35:29.030" style="s2">that paper do you remember you remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.420" end="00:35:30.440" style="s2">after 9/11 when they sent out like three</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.030" end="00:35:34.430" style="s2">or six hundred bucks or something to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.440" end="00:35:36.260" style="s2">everybody yep yeah to me I was a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.430" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">younger then it seemed to me like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.260" end="00:35:40.579" style="s2">crazy far-fetched idea that seemed kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:42.410" style="s2">of stupid it was like what&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.579" end="00:35:44.450" style="s2">hundred dollars gonna do you know for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.410" end="00:35:48.020" style="s2">hey and then in this whole global</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.450" end="00:35:49.819" style="s2">economy situation but somehow today it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.020" end="00:35:51.700" style="s2">seems to make more sense to put the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.819" end="00:35:54.260" style="s2">money in the hands of the citizens</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.700" end="00:35:56.750" style="s2">rather than in the corporations and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.260" end="00:35:59.990" style="s2">hope that the I guess what this would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.750" end="00:36:01.550" style="s2">a trickle up trickle-up economics kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.990" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">of right yeah but think of it think of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.550" end="00:36:08.810" style="s2">it as a can 230 million adult Americans</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.369" style="s2">figure out better places to invest the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.810" end="00:36:13.339" style="s2">money to get better returns over thirty</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.369" end="00:36:16.869" style="s2">years or better better results based on</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.339" end="00:36:19.400" style="s2">that investment over 30 years and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.869" end="00:36:21.589" style="s2">corporations and I think they can I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.400" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">think I think you know they will invest</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.589" end="00:36:27.530" style="s2">in themselves they will you know improve</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:29.960" style="s2">their houses they will and we prove</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.530" end="00:36:32.150" style="s2">their education they&#39;ll you know do</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.960" end="00:36:33.710" style="s2">things and they&#39;ll invest it and it even</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.150" end="00:36:36.470" style="s2">if it they even if they spend it on and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.710" end="00:36:37.970" style="s2">say a vacation or whatever it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.470" end="00:36:39.470" style="s2">you know better spent and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.970" end="00:36:41.990" style="s2">things I&#39;ve seen on the company side</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.470" end="00:36:43.819" style="s2">right and and spending in our vacation</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.990" end="00:36:45.950" style="s2">would help the tourists and travel</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.819" end="00:36:48.730" style="s2">industry but interestingly enough that</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.299" end="00:37:07.020" style="s2">this cycle is it infections is it deaths</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.970" end="00:37:09.569" style="s2">is it hospital bed utilization rates</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.569" end="00:37:13.470" style="s2">watching to see if it&#39;s going up or down</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.400" end="00:37:15.059" style="s2">so that we can predict out you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.470" end="00:37:18.420" style="s2">however many months to see if the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.059" end="00:37:20.819" style="s2">is gonna crest or not well there&#39;s a top</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.420" end="00:37:23.250" style="s2">level numbers infection rates number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.819" end="00:37:26.339" style="s2">people infected but that&#39;s get screwy</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.250" end="00:37:28.140" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have testing kits out</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.200" end="00:37:38.490" style="s2">the United States is that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.609" end="00:37:40.230" style="s2">other places that had in a rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.490" end="00:37:44.700" style="s2">growing numbers had it concentrated in a</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.140" end="00:37:52.380" style="s2">overflow because I mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.240" end="00:37:55.470" style="s2">when things start to really break down</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.380" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">is with this virus is that when the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.470" end="00:38:00.809" style="s2">number of people infected reach a point</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">where it overwhelms the hospital system</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.270" end="00:38:11.670" style="s2">area and they start to have to pick who</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.270" end="00:38:13.319" style="s2">gets treated and who doesn&#39;t so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.670" end="00:38:14.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like when eighty percent eighty</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.700" end="00:39:25.329" style="s2">and they&#39;re wrapping up really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:28.270" style="s2">when they get to a point where they</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.329" end="00:39:31.150" style="s2">overwhelm the hospital system in each of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.270" end="00:39:34.780" style="s2">those spots then we have a serious</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.150" end="00:39:38.289" style="s2">problem from what I understand our our</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.780" end="00:39:39.910" style="s2">hospital bed numbers are like on a per</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.289" end="00:39:43.059" style="s2">capita basis like the lowest that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.910" end="00:39:46.210" style="s2">they&#39;ve been in in a long time yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.059" end="00:39:48.730" style="s2">1975 it was 1.5 million beds and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.210" end="00:39:50.049" style="s2">there was a consolidation wave now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.730" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">down to like nine hundred and thirty</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.049" end="00:39:54.970" style="s2">thousand hospital beds even though our</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:57.579" style="s2">population is 50 percent larger even</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.970" end="00:40:00.549" style="s2">more important as the number of ICU beds</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.579" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">so we have an expensive capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.549" end="00:40:05.799" style="s2">around 90,000 and then respirators and</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.390" style="s2">then there&#39;s another restriction as</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.799" end="00:40:09.549" style="s2">servicing those respirators after</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:12.609" style="s2">they&#39;ve had an infected person on them</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.549" end="00:40:14.109" style="s2">and what happens is that when the 20</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.609" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">percent who do get infected that need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.109" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">be hospitalized end up in the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:22.510" style="s2">usually in those you know that those</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:26.730" style="s2">target demographics 15 percent out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.510" end="00:40:29.170" style="s2">that 20 percent you need oxygen and some</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.730" end="00:40:31.630" style="s2">lighter care but so they have to be on</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.170" end="00:40:36.700" style="s2">you know enriched oxygen environment and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.630" end="00:40:39.579" style="s2">five percent of that twenty percent it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.700" end="00:40:40.660" style="s2">have to be put on ventilators so that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.579" end="00:40:42.970" style="s2">could be you know five percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.660" end="00:40:44.650" style="s2">all the people infected have to be on</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.970" end="00:40:46.260" style="s2">ventilators and that&#39;s where everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.650" end="00:40:50.020" style="s2">starts to really truly break down</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.260" end="00:40:51.789" style="s2">interesting and in in Milan that here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.020" end="00:40:54.539" style="s2">this you know the stories coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.789" end="00:40:57.640" style="s2">the hospitals I mean Mons a first-world</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.539" end="00:41:00.789" style="s2">hospital system it&#39;s really high-end</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.640" end="00:41:04.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a economic center of Italy</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.789" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">and you know they I&#39;ve heard that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.390" end="00:41:10.390" style="s2">had twice as many doctors as the NHS</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">does in the UK you know per Hospital is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.390" end="00:41:14.890" style="s2">that when they started we get</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:17.349" style="s2">overwhelmed they had to make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.890" end="00:41:20.230" style="s2">and who got the respirator and they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.349" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">basing it on efficacy and so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.230" end="00:41:26.020" style="s2">a younger person say 25 with type 1</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:27.160" style="s2">diabetes their epics you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.020" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">efficacy of actually giving them a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.160" end="00:41:33.190" style="s2">respirator was relatively low so they</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.790" end="00:41:34.630" style="s2">denied them access to it and gave it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.190" end="00:41:37.030" style="s2">an older person that had you know a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.630" end="00:41:38.620" style="s2">higher chance of surviving so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.030" end="00:41:40.060" style="s2">this is like the horrible nasty</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.620" end="00:41:41.860" style="s2">decisions that the doctors were making</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.060" end="00:41:44.350" style="s2">and they were like going they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.860" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">sick and they&#39;re facing having to kill</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.350" end="00:41:49.150" style="s2">patients and it&#39;s not a good situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:50.830" style="s2">to be in and you think you think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.150" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">gonna be in that situation in the United</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.830" end="00:41:55.080" style="s2">States at some point soon here yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">really it&#39;s really close</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.080" end="00:41:59.770" style="s2">most people would say that we&#39;re say we</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:01.120" style="s2">can have two weeks behind Italy I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.770" end="00:42:04.180" style="s2">it might be a little longer because we</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.120" end="00:42:07.540" style="s2">have a kind of a multi region situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.180" end="00:42:08.950" style="s2">going I don&#39;t even think you know as</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.540" end="00:42:12.130" style="s2">this develops that even the you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.950" end="00:42:13.930" style="s2">rural hospitals won&#39;t be that much</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.130" end="00:42:15.880" style="s2">better off because they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.930" end="00:42:17.290" style="s2">lighter on the equipment and lighter on</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.880" end="00:42:21.550" style="s2">the beds ICU but it&#39;s and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.290" end="00:42:23.610" style="s2">be swamped more easily I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.550" end="00:42:25.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s really dependent now since</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.610" end="00:42:27.400" style="s2">we&#39;re not seeing much action at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.720" end="00:42:29.650" style="s2">federal level everything&#39;s down to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.400" end="00:42:31.450" style="s2">mitigation level and we have kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.650" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">unique kind of situation in the states</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.450" end="00:42:39.970" style="s2">is that we&#39;re sharing information on how</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:42.490" style="s2">to shut this down and there&#39;s a peer</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.970" end="00:42:44.440" style="s2">pressure and shutting things down that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.490" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">propagate this virus far faster than</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.440" end="00:42:48.670" style="s2">anyone else in the world and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:50.050" style="s2">do it at the mitigation level that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.670" end="00:42:52.150" style="s2">think that over the long term is more</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.050" end="00:42:54.490" style="s2">flexible than the quarantine system and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.150" end="00:42:57.930" style="s2">we&#39;ll have less damage on our economy or</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.490" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">not and our society if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.930" end="00:43:03.990" style="s2">optimally and this is where I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:06.520" style="s2">to figure out this on my own is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.990" end="00:43:09.400" style="s2">because I don&#39;t see anyone thinking this</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.520" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">through is that about a year if this</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.400" end="00:43:14.020" style="s2">lasts another you know twelve thirteen</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">months before next year next spring</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.020" end="00:43:21.940" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of it starts to die off for</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:24.220" style="s2">the summer again is that our optimal</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.940" end="00:43:25.930" style="s2">strategy is to try to become as immune</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.220" end="00:43:27.640" style="s2">to it as possible because we can&#39;t shut</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.930" end="00:43:29.800" style="s2">down for that whole period a dime camp</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.640" end="00:43:33.519" style="s2">quarantine for that well you know 12 13</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.800" end="00:43:34.989" style="s2">14 months right and the way you do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.519" end="00:43:36.729" style="s2">you&#39;d wait without actually causing</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.989" end="00:43:39.219" style="s2">excess death is that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.729" end="00:43:41.079" style="s2">mitigation strategy to keep your number</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.219" end="00:43:42.969" style="s2">of cases below what the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.079" end="00:43:45.969" style="s2">hospital system is they call that down</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.969" end="00:43:47.409" style="s2">you know cramming down the curve or</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.969" end="00:43:49.959" style="s2">pushing down the curve kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.409" end="00:43:50.529" style="s2">right but you don&#39;t want to push it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.959" end="00:43:53.739" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.529" end="00:43:59.189" style="s2">you actually want a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.739" end="00:44:01.869" style="s2">who are not in the targeted category</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.189" end="00:44:06.009" style="s2">target demographic of this virus to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.869" end="00:44:08.439" style="s2">the disease and get the immunity so with</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.009" end="00:44:10.689" style="s2">that when it comes back in the fall that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.439" end="00:44:13.689" style="s2">they won&#39;t get sick and they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.689" end="00:44:16.869" style="s2">carriers you get this herd immunity to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.689" end="00:44:20.380" style="s2">this infection such that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.869" end="00:44:22.899" style="s2">were less vulnerable to this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:26.380" style="s2">right so you know it&#39;s hard to actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.899" end="00:44:28.329" style="s2">you know keep it going at a level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.380" end="00:44:32.199" style="s2">just below the level of the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.329" end="00:44:33.549" style="s2">system I see you see what I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.199" end="00:44:35.949" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.549" end="00:44:37.539" style="s2">analysis to make like how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.949" end="00:44:40.389" style="s2">sure just the right amount of people get</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.539" end="00:44:41.949" style="s2">sick right rather than trying to drive</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.389" end="00:44:43.539" style="s2">it I mean I don&#39;t think an under</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.949" end="00:44:45.519" style="s2">mitigation strategy we&#39;re gonna able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.539" end="00:44:49.539" style="s2">drive it to zero like a or close to zero</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.519" end="00:44:51.339" style="s2">like a quarantine so could you define</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.539" end="00:44:53.919" style="s2">what you mean by mitigation strategy</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.339" end="00:44:55.569" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s this for different there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.919" end="00:44:59.139" style="s2">a lot of terms being thrown around and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.569" end="00:45:00.819" style="s2">for what I could dig in you know based</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.139" end="00:45:03.519" style="s2">on that you know the most cogent experts</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.819" end="00:45:06.130" style="s2">on the topic there are four different</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.519" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">levels of response or a society can make</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.130" end="00:45:10.209" style="s2">against a pandemic and the first layer</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:11.889" style="s2">is mitigation which is mostly done at</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.209" end="00:45:16.239" style="s2">the decentralized level it&#39;s social</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.889" end="00:45:18.089" style="s2">distancing it&#39;s companies saying it work</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.239" end="00:45:22.359" style="s2">online go home</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.089" end="00:45:25.569" style="s2">it&#39;s a events being canceled its people</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.359" end="00:45:27.969" style="s2">not shaking hands and not giving hugs to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.569" end="00:45:30.969" style="s2">people they meet in the street that kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.969" end="00:45:32.439" style="s2">of thing that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.969" end="00:45:35.469" style="s2">now and we&#39;re working out all the ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.439" end="00:45:37.269" style="s2">in which to in you know do that most</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.469" end="00:45:38.589" style="s2">effectively and then and then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.269" end="00:45:41.709" style="s2">enforcing it a little bit through kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.589" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">of peer pressure and that&#39;s moving at</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.709" end="00:45:43.800" style="s2">the speed of you know online thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:47.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.800" end="00:45:52.140" style="s2">and the second layer is containment and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.880" end="00:45:53.550" style="s2">usually that is travel restrictions for</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.140" end="00:45:55.170" style="s2">the most part it&#39;s done at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.550" end="00:45:58.110" style="s2">governmental level usually the federal</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.170" end="00:46:00.180" style="s2">and is in the US case it would be say</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.110" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">nobody from China can come here in less</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.180" end="00:46:04.620" style="s2">stay or that first you could say nobody</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:05.910" style="s2">from China can come here directly or you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.620" end="00:46:09.750" style="s2">could say they could be you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.910" end="00:46:12.540" style="s2">put into isolation for two weeks that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.750" end="00:46:15.450" style="s2">can slow the rate of propagation of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.540" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">virus then layer after that is isolation</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.450" end="00:46:21.360" style="s2">and usually that&#39;s connected to contact</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:22.920" style="s2">tracing and you know investigative</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.360" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">technique and and it that means</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.920" end="00:46:28.170" style="s2">basically if you have the virus you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:32.040" style="s2">there hospitalized or if you&#39;re not that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.170" end="00:46:34.380" style="s2">sick you&#39;re still isolated or if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.380" end="00:46:40.790" style="s2">you were you had a contact you would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:43.860" style="s2">put into isolation now that can be done</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:45.900" style="s2">voluntarily or in the case of what they</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.860" end="00:46:47.310" style="s2">did just recently in New York and New</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.900" end="00:46:49.080" style="s2">Rochelle you know with the National</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.750" end="00:46:56.760" style="s2">order right so they&#39;ve got to put them</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:46:58.590" style="s2">in a facility and input National Guard</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.760" end="00:47:01.350" style="s2">around it and say don&#39;t move for two</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.590" end="00:47:03.330" style="s2">weeks all right gang and then you have</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:53.130" style="s2">had local leaders who were in charge of</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.650" end="00:48:34.650" style="s2">a it&#39;s a pretty pretty austere kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.930" end="00:48:37.619" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like very centrally</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.650" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">controlled yet also operating at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.619" end="00:48:42.720" style="s2">local level work you know every town was</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.550" end="00:48:54.119" style="s2">then there says this weird kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.170" end="00:48:56.730" style="s2">middle ground that Singapore started</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.119" end="00:48:59.670" style="s2">putting in place the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.730" end="00:49:03.319" style="s2">interventionalist kind of mitigation</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.670" end="00:49:06.540" style="s2">strategy and where they are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.319" end="00:49:08.309" style="s2">peppering people with reminders of to</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.540" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">wash their hands and stuff watching</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.480" end="00:49:19.319" style="s2">that change your behavior constant</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.250" end="00:49:21.780" style="s2">testing temperature testing and in every</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.319" end="00:49:24.020" style="s2">location so you can&#39;t really go into a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.780" end="00:49:26.329" style="s2">building without being tested and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.020" end="00:49:28.079" style="s2">just you know social distance</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.329" end="00:49:31.140" style="s2">maximization they&#39;ve been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.079" end="00:49:33.480" style="s2">effective in in mitigating it mitigating</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.140" end="00:49:35.940" style="s2">the the spread of the virus using that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.480" end="00:49:37.650" style="s2">extra governmental add-on but that</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.940" end="00:49:39.299" style="s2">that&#39;s a level of control that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.650" end="00:49:43.410" style="s2">probably never see in the states that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.299" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">requires a super competent kind of city</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.410" end="00:49:46.740" style="s2">level government hey I don&#39;t know of any</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:49.049" style="s2">city level government that could pull</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.740" end="00:49:51.210" style="s2">that off let alone national right so do</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.049" end="00:49:53.069" style="s2">you think that the the mass quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.210" end="00:49:55.290" style="s2">you know possibility is is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.069" end="00:49:58.170" style="s2">ruled out for our here in the u.s. I</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.290" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">want to say definitely ruled out I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.170" end="00:50:04.200" style="s2">well it&#39;s more likely if it does occur</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:06.809" style="s2">it will be at the state or city level</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.200" end="00:50:09.270" style="s2">right and then it will be instituted by</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.809" end="00:50:10.230" style="s2">the state or city government and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.270" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">could they could</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.230" end="00:50:14.790" style="s2">just say you know if it&#39;s New York they</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:17.250" style="s2">put a ring around it and say no one in</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.790" end="00:50:21.109" style="s2">and out and then they have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.250" end="00:50:21.109" style="s2">how to get the the supplies in and out</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.590" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a mess and you know if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:29.270" style="s2">stuff leaks out like it did in Italy you</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.200" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">they said okay well we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.820" end="00:50:58.140" style="s2">expand this quarantine to everywhere so</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.640" end="00:51:00.210" style="s2">if you do it wrong you spread the virus</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.140" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">everywhere and I&#39;m sure they went</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.759" end="00:52:27.990" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t affect me you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.220" end="00:52:30.269" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna get sick my chances of</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.990" end="00:52:33.000" style="s2">getting sicker really low and if I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.269" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">get sick man you know it it might be</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.000" end="00:52:36.329" style="s2">just a cough or headache and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:39.210" style="s2">probably true but if you care about</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.329" end="00:52:42.660" style="s2">other people who are older I mean I have</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.210" end="00:52:44.339" style="s2">you know I have a mother you know a</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.660" end="00:52:45.930" style="s2">little older and she would be in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.339" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">vulnerable population I have I have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.930" end="00:52:51.900" style="s2">daughter who has type 1 diabetes had it</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:53.970" style="s2">since she was 2 and she&#39;s an operating</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.900" end="00:52:55.380" style="s2">room nurse so I&#39;m kind of I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.970" end="00:52:57.900" style="s2">worried that she&#39;s going to be put in</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.380" end="00:52:59.789" style="s2">the crosshairs on this so I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.900" end="00:53:02.190" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to take measures to make</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.789" end="00:53:04.529" style="s2">sure that they&#39;re protected and isolated</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.190" end="00:53:08.130" style="s2">from this extent possible right</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.529" end="00:53:10.529" style="s2">it&#39;s it really when you asked when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.130" end="00:53:12.450" style="s2">see people say their level of concern</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.529" end="00:53:15.240" style="s2">over this it often it goes from 2 to 8</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.450" end="00:53:17.430" style="s2">or 9 and you know you can see the all</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.240" end="00:53:18.930" style="s2">the twos are usually younger you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.430" end="00:53:20.099" style="s2">guys that like you know they live in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.930" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">pretty much alone they really don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.099" end="00:53:25.980" style="s2">that kind of fear there you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:27.660" style="s2">having to care for people you know you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.980" end="00:53:29.759" style="s2">know and then you have the older ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.660" end="00:53:31.579" style="s2">who have kids or have with problems and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.759" end="00:53:33.750" style="s2">you have you know caring for older</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.579" end="00:53:36.119" style="s2">parents and the like and it&#39;s like ok</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.750" end="00:53:38.759" style="s2">that that&#39;s when the fear goes up and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.119" end="00:53:42.779" style="s2">can understand both perspectives but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.759" end="00:53:45.420" style="s2">think the more conservative approach is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.779" end="00:53:47.640" style="s2">to you know preserve the life and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.420" end="00:53:49.470" style="s2">probably the best way to go right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.640" end="00:53:51.059" style="s2">I&#39;m telling my kids everything&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.470" end="00:53:53.039" style="s2">be fine don&#39;t worry you&#39;re totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.059" end="00:53:54.180" style="s2">healthy you&#39;ll be fine you&#39;ll brush it</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.039" end="00:53:55.559" style="s2">off it&#39;s not a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.180" end="00:53:59.069" style="s2">oh it&#39;s even better for kids under 15</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.559" end="00:54:01.500" style="s2">yeah they can&#39;t even detect the virus in</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.069" end="00:54:03.299" style="s2">those kids right it&#39;s awesome it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.500" end="00:54:06.599" style="s2">the nestling news but then they say well</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.299" end="00:54:08.700" style="s2">what about grandma exactly exactly so my</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.599" end="00:54:10.710" style="s2">mom my mom is uh she&#39;s a medical doctor</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.700" end="00:54:13.589" style="s2">and now a hospital administrator so she</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.710" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">likes she&#39;s she&#39;s crosshairs she&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.589" end="00:54:18.269" style="s2">the crosshairs and she has a she has a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:20.279" style="s2">crew scheduled in like two weeks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.269" end="00:54:22.230" style="s2">been on the books from like happy here</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.279" end="00:54:24.569" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to talk her talk her out</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.230" end="00:54:26.549" style="s2">of going but she&#39;s not well the CDC</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.569" end="00:54:27.990" style="s2">already said they would not recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.549" end="00:54:29.549" style="s2">any when using you know go on cruises</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.990" end="00:54:31.890" style="s2">they said yeah that&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.549" end="00:54:33.420" style="s2">hazard right now most of these things</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.890" end="00:54:34.470" style="s2">most these big events are canceling</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.420" end="00:54:36.450" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.470" end="00:54:39.210" style="s2">people are doing you know voting with</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.450" end="00:54:41.010" style="s2">their feet right so when you lose more</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.210" end="00:54:43.609" style="s2">than half of the audience or most half</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.010" end="00:54:46.080" style="s2">the people on the crews have opted out</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.609" end="00:54:48.510" style="s2">do you continue to do the crews or you</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.080" end="00:54:52.109" style="s2">do continue to hold the event and do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.510" end="00:54:54.180" style="s2">as a run it out of los or do you cancel</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.109" end="00:54:57.990" style="s2">it yourself so I think we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.180" end="00:55:00.900" style="s2">about varying levels of effect here</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.990" end="00:55:02.670" style="s2">right where we&#39;re thinking about who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.900" end="00:55:04.710" style="s2">gonna get sick who&#39;s gonna get treated</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.670" end="00:55:07.290" style="s2">and who&#39;s gonna end up dying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.710" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">that level and then there&#39;s the second</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.290" end="00:55:11.820" style="s2">second and third level effects of what</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:13.890" style="s2">happens to the economy and you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.820" end="00:55:15.900" style="s2">interestingly enough with the economy</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.890" end="00:55:18.359" style="s2">being so big as it is you know just</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.900" end="00:55:21.390" style="s2">economic dislocations lead to extra</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.359" end="00:55:23.940" style="s2">deaths as well too right right and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.390" end="00:55:26.070" style="s2">then there&#39;s also the issue of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.940" end="00:55:28.290" style="s2">medicine that we get from places that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.070" end="00:55:30.540" style="s2">are under quarantine or aren&#39;t producing</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.290" end="00:55:33.240" style="s2">as much as they were before have you</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.540" end="00:55:35.849" style="s2">seen any information or data on on</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.240" end="00:55:37.020" style="s2">insulin distribution in manufacturing I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.849" end="00:55:39.030" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.020" end="00:55:41.339" style="s2">insulin manufacturers around the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.030" end="00:55:44.490" style="s2">but most of the precursors come from</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.339" end="00:55:45.869" style="s2">China and that was one area in the lumo</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.490" end="00:55:47.550" style="s2">order that we were really focused on</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.869" end="00:55:50.040" style="s2">it&#39;s what are these you know second and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.550" end="00:55:51.500" style="s2">third order effects going to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.040" end="00:55:53.369" style="s2">and do you see you know manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.500" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">disruptions like that that are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.369" end="00:55:57.330" style="s2">lead to additional distress economic and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:55:59.609" style="s2">medical here in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.330" end="00:56:03.089" style="s2">especially yeah I think those are going</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.609" end="00:56:05.130" style="s2">to erupt on a surprise basis very much</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.089" end="00:56:09.300" style="s2">the same way that a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.130" end="00:56:10.619" style="s2">consume masks and surgical gloves we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.300" end="00:56:12.570" style="s2">suddenly surprised in the last three</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.619" end="00:56:14.460" style="s2">weeks that they were all gone right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.570" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna find that across the board</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.460" end="00:56:18.869" style="s2">and in a lot of medicines particularly</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:20.940" style="s2">life-saving medicines I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.869" end="00:56:22.170" style="s2">this is like okay we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.940" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">things that the federal government can</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.170" end="00:56:29.310" style="s2">do this is where the feds can play a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:30.420" style="s2">part of a crucial role it&#39;s a golden</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.310" end="00:56:32.970" style="s2">opportunity to bring medical</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.420" end="00:56:34.710" style="s2">manufacturing back to the states in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.970" end="00:56:36.869" style="s2">crash program and then keep it here</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.710" end="00:56:38.220" style="s2">because you could you have government</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.869" end="00:56:40.500" style="s2">spending on health care and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.220" end="00:56:42.970" style="s2">government spending on health care can</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.500" end="00:56:45.010" style="s2">be used a lock in place</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.970" end="00:56:47.530" style="s2">you know domestic manufacturing of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.010" end="00:56:50.170" style="s2">items this is like a this is a safety</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.530" end="00:56:52.809" style="s2">issue it&#39;s a it&#39;s a national safety</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.170" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">issue and it it would take billions to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.809" end="00:56:57.130" style="s2">get it going but it could happen really</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">really quickly and it would be a net</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.130" end="00:57:02.470" style="s2">positive to come out of this with you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:04.109" style="s2">know more resilience and and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.470" end="00:57:06.609" style="s2">capability to take care of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.109" end="00:57:07.960" style="s2">when the world disconnects because what</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.609" end="00:57:11.079" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is huge sections of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.960" end="00:57:12.430" style="s2">world just kind of winking out and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.079" end="00:57:16.089" style="s2">know if this happens again in the future</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.430" end="00:57:18.819" style="s2">and it will I mean this stuff will</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.089" end="00:57:20.829" style="s2">happen again you don&#39;t wanna get caught</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.819" end="00:57:23.049" style="s2">flat-footed or what every time is it so</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.829" end="00:57:24.849" style="s2">this is like that&#39;s a that&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.049" end="00:57:27.670" style="s2">that trump could do right now the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.849" end="00:57:28.780" style="s2">thing would be the ubi for the economic</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.670" end="00:57:31.089" style="s2">kind of cushioning effects that people</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.780" end="00:57:35.430" style="s2">aren&#39;t kicked out of their apartments or</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.089" end="00:57:37.869" style="s2">in Italy they waived mortgage and rent</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.430" end="00:57:40.359" style="s2">so they put a moratorium on that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.869" end="00:57:41.470" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to pay that Wow cuz they</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.359" end="00:57:43.089" style="s2">don&#39;t want people thrown in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.470" end="00:57:45.789" style="s2">I mean because they can&#39;t work they you</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.089" end="00:57:47.619" style="s2">know what do you do I have no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.789" end="00:57:48.579" style="s2">you put that into practice but that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.619" end="00:57:51.250" style="s2">interesting concept</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.579" end="00:57:53.160" style="s2">so what you know to tie this all in with</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.250" end="00:57:57.579" style="s2">some of our earlier discussions right</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.160" end="00:57:59.559" style="s2">the the the grand strategy with China</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.579" end="00:58:03.549" style="s2">has been a failure as you so eloquently</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.559" end="00:58:06.150" style="s2">put it worth earlier and in a previous</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.549" end="00:58:08.770" style="s2">podcast and in writing and such and</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:23.950" style="s2">talking to him you know he really</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">emphasized how we not only offshored</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.950" end="00:58:28.420" style="s2">sort of basic manufacturing but then</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">also like precision tool manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.420" end="00:58:33.579" style="s2">and then high-level stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:36.369" style="s2">disrupted the iterative process between</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.579" end="00:58:39.010" style="s2">manufacturer and engineer which has</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.369" end="00:58:42.010" style="s2">really handy handicapped our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.010" end="00:58:43.710" style="s2">produce important elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.010" end="00:58:46.450" style="s2">manufacturing chain as well as in</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.710" end="00:58:48.670" style="s2">national defense and whatnot and now</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.450" end="00:58:51.220" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that offshoring and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.670" end="00:58:53.560" style="s2">exporting our ability to provide</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.220" end="00:58:56.860" style="s2">medicine and healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.560" end="00:58:59.260" style="s2">all in the name of global trade and WTO</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.860" end="00:59:01.660" style="s2">rules and China&#39;s ascension and all that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.260" end="00:59:03.670" style="s2">I mean is this gonna finally be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.660" end="00:59:06.190" style="s2">wake-up call for people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.670" end="00:59:08.560" style="s2">that you know comparative advantage</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.190" end="00:59:10.990" style="s2">isn&#39;t always necessarily the best best</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.560" end="00:59:13.360" style="s2">you know rule to follow and that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.990" end="00:59:15.370" style="s2">know exporting all this stuff to foreign</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.360" end="00:59:17.950" style="s2">countries that manufacturing is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.370" end="00:59:22.000" style="s2">always a hundred percent going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.950" end="00:59:25.330" style="s2">positive and that there&#39;s a real an</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:27.070" style="s2">urgent need to like begin Rhian shoring</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.330" end="00:59:28.840" style="s2">all these various elements of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.070" end="00:59:31.570" style="s2">national security and our national</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.840" end="00:59:35.950" style="s2">health is this going to be the moment at</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.570" end="00:59:37.600" style="s2">which those tides you know change or do</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.950" end="00:59:38.200" style="s2">we still have that long road to hoe</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.600" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.200" end="00:59:44.320" style="s2">well you&#39;d hope right hey</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:47.080" style="s2">so I mean Trump is pretty much just he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.320" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">singular in his you know focus on that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.080" end="00:59:54.430" style="s2">mean you look at Biden and he you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.160" end="00:59:56.860" style="s2">he is go back to you know way was with</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.430" end="01:00:00.550" style="s2">Obama and was with Bush go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.860" end="01:00:02.560" style="s2">the old open approach kind of a legacy</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.550" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">of the Cold War where were the market of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.560" end="01:00:06.760" style="s2">last resort for everybody and we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:09.340" style="s2">it we&#39;ll take the losses associated with</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.760" end="01:00:14.650" style="s2">that because we&#39;re leader and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.340" end="01:00:16.780" style="s2">do that so our return to the old order</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.650" end="01:00:20.380" style="s2">going exactly the opposite direction is</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.780" end="01:00:23.500" style="s2">is looming right and I just still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.380" end="01:00:27.580" style="s2">see people fully cognizant of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.500" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re barnable yet I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.580" end="01:00:31.120" style="s2">like again you got to take advantage of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">the the opportunities when they present</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.120" end="01:00:35.890" style="s2">themselves right so like free money take</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:38.980" style="s2">advantage of it yeah an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.890" end="01:00:43.150" style="s2">point out that you know we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.980" end="01:00:45.700" style="s2">manufacture medical devices and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.150" end="01:00:48.790" style="s2">everything from masks and gloves all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.700" end="01:00:50.770" style="s2">way through to key ingredients that go</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.790" end="01:00:53.770" style="s2">into insulin and and and and the like</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.770" end="01:00:55.870" style="s2">here in order to protect us in case</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.770" end="01:00:57.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a global supply disruption well</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.870" end="01:00:59.170" style="s2">this is like the perfect opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.310" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">do that if you don&#39;t take on you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.170" end="01:01:02.380" style="s2">take advantage of the opportunities we</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:05.350" style="s2">come out the other side a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.380" end="01:01:06.560" style="s2">die things go wrong as a result of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.350" end="01:01:07.880" style="s2">and people afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.560" end="01:01:09.620" style="s2">oh they&#39;re focused on other things</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.880" end="01:01:11.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not taking heat you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.620" end="01:01:12.530" style="s2">trying to recover and they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.000" end="01:01:14.300" style="s2">even thinking through the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.530" end="01:01:16.070" style="s2">ways to stop it in the futures you got</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.300" end="01:01:17.900" style="s2">to get a strike when it top you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.070" end="01:01:19.310" style="s2">when the opportunities presented you</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.900" end="01:01:21.920" style="s2">know it does seem like Trump might be</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.310" end="01:01:23.660" style="s2">uniquely suited to solve that problem or</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.920" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">at least move and move us back in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.660" end="01:01:27.500" style="s2">other direction right now and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;s funny for anybody that&#39;s followed</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.500" end="01:01:30.530" style="s2">or studied Trump for a long time you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.120" end="01:01:32.660" style="s2">know all of this comes from his</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.530" end="01:01:35.060" style="s2">experience in the 80s in real estate in</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.660" end="01:01:37.670" style="s2">New York and when the when the Japanese</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.060" end="01:01:40.220" style="s2">bought Rockefeller Center like Japanese</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.670" end="01:01:41.660" style="s2">buying Rockefeller Center and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.220" end="01:01:43.310" style="s2">famous golf course in California and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.660" end="01:01:46.340" style="s2">Carmel in the name escapes me right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">those those moments you know stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.340" end="01:01:51.920" style="s2">Trump&#39;s mind so so prominently that 40</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:54.140" style="s2">years later you know he&#39;s still running</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.920" end="01:01:56.810" style="s2">and appropriately and but maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.140" end="01:01:59.390" style="s2">just accidentally on his part his part</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.810" end="01:02:02.570" style="s2">but you know his whole his whole focus</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.390" end="01:02:06.860" style="s2">has been on observing and understanding</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.570" end="01:02:09.440" style="s2">how our imbalances with China are a risk</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.860" end="01:02:11.840" style="s2">to us and it&#39;s just funny to me that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.440" end="01:02:14.090" style="s2">was born all those years ago during the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.840" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">80s yes it is New York real estate</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.090" end="01:02:19.010" style="s2">experience it&#39;s so funny because I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:21.620" style="s2">it the kind of Reagan James Baker kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.010" end="01:02:23.000" style="s2">of approach to Japan was the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.620" end="01:02:25.700" style="s2">thing that could have saved us from this</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.000" end="01:02:26.750" style="s2">problem with China is it I mean when it</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.700" end="01:02:28.430" style="s2">looked like the Japanese were going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.750" end="01:02:29.750" style="s2">eat the auto industry I mean James Baker</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.430" end="01:02:32.450" style="s2">came over and said you know to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.750" end="01:02:34.970" style="s2">Japanese I said hey I tried deficit with</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.450" end="01:02:36.530" style="s2">you is 60 billion either you correct it</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.970" end="01:02:38.270" style="s2">through buying more of our stuff for you</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.530" end="01:02:40.820" style="s2">cap what you get yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.270" end="01:02:42.470" style="s2">if not then we&#39;re going to cut you out</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.820" end="01:02:44.330" style="s2">we&#39;ll find a way to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.470" end="01:02:46.400" style="s2">don&#39;t sell anything here and they you</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.330" end="01:02:48.530" style="s2">said Japanese willing to work they were</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.400" end="01:02:51.410" style="s2">willing to manage the situation and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.530" end="01:02:53.360" style="s2">we got a auto recovery and now we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.410" end="01:02:54.440" style="s2">auto manufacturers here in the states</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.360" end="01:02:57.590" style="s2">that that wouldn&#39;t have existed</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.440" end="01:02:59.660" style="s2">otherwise right and we had a total</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.590" end="01:03:02.630" style="s2">abdication of responsibility when it</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.660" end="01:03:04.970" style="s2">came to Chinese trade it was it was like</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.630" end="01:03:07.970" style="s2">this kind of weird ideology that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.970" end="01:03:10.820" style="s2">it has to be this way you know every</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.970" end="01:03:12.440" style="s2">through has to be zero barriers and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.820" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">know that&#39;s the only way to approach</p>

<p begin="01:03:23.170" end="01:03:28.750" style="s2">you know what&#39;s uniquely American</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.950" end="01:03:32.260" style="s2">American philosophy is this pragmatism</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.750" end="01:03:35.590" style="s2">if it works do it all right you know hey</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.260" end="01:03:37.390" style="s2">if you&#39;re locked into an ideology and it</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:22.810" style="s2">remember Paul Krugman said something</p>

<p begin="01:04:36.900" end="01:04:43.510" style="s2">the politics in the United States from</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.400" end="01:04:45.700" style="s2">90s the 2000s 2010 are all coalesce</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.510" end="01:04:48.850" style="s2">around this central idea the neoliberal</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.700" end="01:04:51.370" style="s2">ideas of lowering borders and such and</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.850" end="01:04:53.560" style="s2">and and now we&#39;re really seeing all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.370" end="01:04:56.200" style="s2">negative impacts of that and I just</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.560" end="01:04:59.290" style="s2">don&#39;t understand don&#39;t I&#39;m not sure to</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.200" end="01:05:00.870" style="s2">what extent the this is information</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.290" end="01:05:03.400" style="s2">that&#39;s filtered into the general</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.870" end="01:05:06.130" style="s2">populace and into the general you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.400" end="01:05:08.350" style="s2">people in the United States you know of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.130" end="01:05:11.170" style="s2">some of it&#39;s so esoteric and obscure and</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.350" end="01:05:12.700" style="s2">it&#39;s economics and but people feel it</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.170" end="01:05:14.530" style="s2">right they feel right on the ground and</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.700" end="01:05:15.550" style="s2">they feel at the factory closed and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.530" end="01:05:18.430" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna feel it when they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.550" end="01:05:19.840" style="s2">get their insulin and so it would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.430" end="01:05:22.210" style="s2">wonderful if we could turn this around</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.840" end="01:05:23.860" style="s2">and turn it into something positive that</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.210" end="01:05:25.530" style="s2">would continue this decoupling that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.860" end="01:05:28.019" style="s2">need to have and the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.530" end="01:05:30.609" style="s2">re-establishment of our independence</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.019" end="01:05:32.019" style="s2">self-care really this is what we were</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.609" end="01:05:33.579" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s like it&#39;s independent</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.019" end="01:05:35.559" style="s2">self-care ability to defend ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.579" end="01:05:38.349" style="s2">and our ability to take care of our own</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.559" end="01:05:41.049" style="s2">health and and we&#39;re gonna use that to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.349" end="01:05:42.609" style="s2">transition into what what all of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.049" end="01:05:45.539" style="s2">sudden seems a little bit mundane which</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.609" end="01:05:48.309" style="s2">would be the current current politics</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.539" end="01:05:50.170" style="s2">you know last time we talked and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.309" end="01:05:51.880" style="s2">just observing your writings over the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.170" end="01:05:55.450" style="s2">last year you know you&#39;re very focused</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.880" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">on the network political movements</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.450" end="01:06:00.670" style="s2">versus established political movements</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:03.009" style="s2">and could you just sort of give your</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.670" end="01:06:05.499" style="s2">assessment of what&#39;s happened with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.009" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">Democratic primary leading up into Super</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.499" end="01:06:10.479" style="s2">Tuesday and and the coalescence behind</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:12.519" style="s2">Biden and what do you what do you see</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.479" end="01:06:15.459" style="s2">there and what is it portend for the</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.519" end="01:06:17.459" style="s2">general election do you think okay good</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.459" end="01:06:20.619" style="s2">I&#39;d like to just add something to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.459" end="01:06:22.269" style="s2">the last point you were making before we</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.619" end="01:06:25.299" style="s2">transitioned yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.269" end="01:06:27.339" style="s2">general philosophy about kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.299" end="01:06:29.289" style="s2">resilience in a kind of a connected</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.339" end="01:06:31.089" style="s2">world is that you know I started my</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.289" end="01:06:32.589" style="s2">stuff back with global guerrillas about</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.089" end="01:06:36.670" style="s2">small groups of people being able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.589" end="01:06:39.190" style="s2">disrupt the global systems and in that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.670" end="01:06:40.900" style="s2">disruption would percolate and cascade</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.190" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">throughout these interconnected systems</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.900" end="01:06:45.910" style="s2">and a lot of people thought hey that</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:48.339" style="s2">means that I have to become totally</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.910" end="01:06:50.259" style="s2">disconnected I have to cut the grid you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.339" end="01:06:53.229" style="s2">know disconnect from the grid and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.259" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">produce everything myself and and my</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.229" end="01:06:57.789" style="s2">philosophy on that after carefully</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:06:59.769" style="s2">thinking about it and trying out</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.789" end="01:07:03.069" style="s2">different strategies for quite a long</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.769" end="01:07:04.630" style="s2">time was that you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.069" end="01:07:07.029" style="s2">disconnect from the grid you want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.630" end="01:07:09.069" style="s2">connect with you want to connect to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.029" end="01:07:11.650" style="s2">grid or connect to the the global system</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.069" end="01:07:14.289" style="s2">on your own terms and it means that</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.650" end="01:07:15.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to take got to be in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.289" end="01:07:17.349" style="s2">situation where you could take advantage</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.880" end="01:07:21.940" style="s2">of all the benefits of being</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.349" end="01:07:25.660" style="s2">interconnected but you&#39;re not vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.940" end="01:07:28.449" style="s2">to situations when it breaks down so</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.660" end="01:07:30.940" style="s2">what is disrupted and it breaks you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.449" end="01:07:33.779" style="s2">not just you&#39;re not destitute you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.940" end="01:07:36.219" style="s2">you know completely prostate or a</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.779" end="01:07:38.829" style="s2">prostrate you know you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.219" end="01:07:40.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not falling apart as a result of</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.829" end="01:07:43.349" style="s2">that disconnection</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.470" end="01:07:45.960" style="s2">it&#39;s connecting on your own terms is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.349" end="01:07:48.119" style="s2">keys you get the best of both worlds so</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.960" end="01:07:49.440" style="s2">like for instance I have just just</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.119" end="01:07:52.230" style="s2">putting into concrete terms I have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.440" end="01:07:55.280" style="s2">generator and the whole house generator</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.230" end="01:07:59.190" style="s2">so when the electrical grid goes down</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:08:00.450" style="s2">that&#39;s fine my generator boots up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.190" end="01:08:02.040" style="s2">not that I&#39;d want to have my house</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.450" end="01:08:03.869" style="s2">disconnected from the electrical grid</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.040" end="01:08:05.970" style="s2">right this is relatively cheap energy</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.869" end="01:08:08.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s like hey why not take advantage</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.970" end="01:08:11.250" style="s2">of it in volume in it I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.460" end="01:08:12.990" style="s2">maintain all of the systems required to</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.250" end="01:08:16.680" style="s2">actually keep generating that amount</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.990" end="01:08:20.009" style="s2">electricity so all the benefits with a</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.680" end="01:08:21.900" style="s2">back-up plan with on my own terms</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.009" end="01:08:23.940" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s generally the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.900" end="01:08:25.799" style="s2">thing with life is you have to connect</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.940" end="01:08:28.770" style="s2">on your own terms if you feel that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.799" end="01:08:29.540" style="s2">know disconnection is going to wipe you</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.770" end="01:08:32.609" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.540" end="01:08:34.500" style="s2">avoid you know just set it up in a way</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.609" end="01:08:36.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to wipe you out right</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.500" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">but our our connection into the global</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.690" end="01:08:40.980" style="s2">trade by our I mean the United States</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">into the right trade network was a was</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.980" end="01:08:46.620" style="s2">absolutely yeah yeah it was not it</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:50.370" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there were no turn turns or real</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.620" end="01:08:52.560" style="s2">for thought put into it I mean do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.370" end="01:08:55.890" style="s2">think in the do you think that those</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.560" end="01:08:58.380" style="s2">guys knew did they expect or do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.890" end="01:09:01.020" style="s2">think I&#39;m just trying to gauge like the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.380" end="01:09:03.989" style="s2">general level of cynicism or greed that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.020" end="01:09:06.029" style="s2">was in play at that time you know I know</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.989" end="01:09:07.890" style="s2">everybody wanted those those hungry</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.029" end="01:09:09.870" style="s2">Chinese markets and you know got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.890" end="01:09:12.960" style="s2">billion new people to sell bicycles to</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.870" end="01:09:13.529" style="s2">or whatever but you know nobody thought</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.960" end="01:09:15.569" style="s2">this through</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.529" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">like we just didn&#39;t know at that at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.569" end="01:09:18.989" style="s2">time I mean the only people that were</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:21.719" style="s2">really complaining really loudly</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.989" end="01:09:23.850" style="s2">we&#39;re like the Black Bloc people and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.719" end="01:09:26.190" style="s2">like an Tifa which is really crazy to</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.850" end="01:09:29.100" style="s2">think back on now that you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.190" end="01:09:32.330" style="s2">circled coming around 360 degrees in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.100" end="01:09:34.830" style="s2">way with with the protests there but</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.330" end="01:09:37.200" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty nutty to see that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.830" end="01:09:38.940" style="s2">Al Gore was the one doing the heavy duty</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.200" end="01:09:41.580" style="s2">lobbying Congress to get the China</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.940" end="01:09:43.049" style="s2">admitted into the WTO I mean and trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.580" end="01:09:45.239" style="s2">to almost single-handedly is the one</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.049" end="01:09:48.390" style="s2">that you know accelerated global warming</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.239" end="01:09:50.069" style="s2">by 50 years right so right he obviously</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.390" end="01:09:51.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t like think it through is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.069" end="01:09:53.799" style="s2">you&#39;re transferring environmentally</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.630" end="01:09:55.630" style="s2">protected manufacturing to a</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.799" end="01:09:57.909" style="s2">a place that just will lift all those</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.630" end="01:09:59.949" style="s2">restrictions and just do it as dirty as</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.909" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">possible is good it&#39;d be a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.949" end="01:10:04.030" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it reminds me of how NATO</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:06.040" style="s2">expansion you know how do we expand a</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.030" end="01:10:06.699" style="s2">NATO up to the edges of the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.040" end="01:10:08.349" style="s2">or Russia</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.699" end="01:10:10.570" style="s2">I heard that follow the Sun you Soviet</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.349" end="01:10:13.210" style="s2">Union and it was under Clinton and they</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.570" end="01:10:17.409" style="s2">traced it back he traced his decision</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.210" end="01:10:20.760" style="s2">back to when he had a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.409" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">coming in to discuss ending genocides</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.760" end="01:10:25.510" style="s2">which is interesting and then that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.679" end="01:10:26.860" style="s2">hear this story is it well yeah I just</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.510" end="01:10:29.050" style="s2">laughed because I remember Hillary</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.860" end="01:10:31.659" style="s2">Clinton constantly referencing Rwanda</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.050" end="01:10:34.780" style="s2">constantly referencing right yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.659" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">they he asked them what can we do to</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.780" end="01:10:41.800" style="s2">prevent genocides in the future and they</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:42.820" style="s2">said expand NATO all right and so you</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.800" end="01:10:44.710" style="s2">know that was their thinking through</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.820" end="01:10:46.270" style="s2">maybe the the Balkans crisis and they</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.710" end="01:10:47.889" style="s2">were thinking okay if we had more NATO</p>

<p begin="01:10:53.230" end="01:10:57.880" style="s2">spur-of-the-moment decision without any</p>

<p begin="01:11:06.369" end="01:11:10.750" style="s2">became right the obviously obviously</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.920" end="01:11:13.179" style="s2">we&#39;re corrected that the u.s. was an</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.750" end="01:11:16.300" style="s2">aggressor right and then we that made</p>

<p begin="01:11:23.440" end="01:11:28.030" style="s2">kind of thing and you know a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.869" end="01:11:31.150" style="s2">was like trendy academic theories and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.030" end="01:11:32.909" style="s2">you know philosophies that everything is</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.150" end="01:11:36.070" style="s2">going to be interconnected and you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.909" end="01:11:37.239" style="s2">yeah there has to be right without</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.070" end="01:11:38.829" style="s2">thinking through the consequences of</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.239" end="01:11:40.449" style="s2">disruptions and everything else but you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.829" end="01:11:41.889" style="s2">wanted to talk about top politics so we</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.449" end="01:11:43.869" style="s2">probably should jump yeah we can do that</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.889" end="01:11:45.730" style="s2">one last thing you know I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.869" end="01:11:48.040" style="s2">kill a good conversation just forever as</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.730" end="01:11:51.460" style="s2">an agenda oh what&#39;s interesting actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.040" end="01:11:54.670" style="s2">that popped into my mind just now as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.460" end="01:11:56.530" style="s2">comparison social media right it comes</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.670" end="01:11:57.809" style="s2">out everybody gets out there starts</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.530" end="01:12:00.280" style="s2">screaming and yelling</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.809" end="01:12:03.219" style="s2">exploring and expressing as Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.280" end="01:12:04.929" style="s2">says and it seems like this is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.219" end="01:12:06.609" style="s2">natural course of action this is where</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.929" end="01:12:09.010" style="s2">we should go this is the future yada</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.609" end="01:12:11.199" style="s2">yada well you know what in the last few</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.010" end="01:12:13.209" style="s2">years people have realized that actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.199" end="01:12:14.979" style="s2">doing all of your business in public and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.209" end="01:12:17.559" style="s2">sharing everything in public and being</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.979" end="01:12:19.389" style="s2">100% engaged in social media may not</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.559" end="01:12:22.409" style="s2">necessarily be the smartest corner of</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.389" end="01:12:25.719" style="s2">course affection and in fact and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.409" end="01:12:28.839" style="s2">breaking off from that giant system into</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.719" end="01:12:33.189" style="s2">smaller groups that are private with</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.839" end="01:12:34.989" style="s2">high trust levels yeah are more</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.189" end="01:12:37.389" style="s2">effective than participating in this</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.989" end="01:12:40.269" style="s2">giant cacophony where there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.389" end="01:12:43.719" style="s2">downside risk and it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.269" end="01:12:46.539" style="s2">parallel to to globalization and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.719" end="01:12:49.510" style="s2">path that we took into WTO and out of</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.539" end="01:12:53.530" style="s2">the 90s and now here we are considering</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.510" end="01:12:55.989" style="s2">whether or not you know as a rule those</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.530" end="01:12:57.849" style="s2">sort of open exchanges are 100% an</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.989" end="01:13:01.329" style="s2">essential good and are there ways that</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.849" end="01:13:04.929" style="s2">we can do it more effectively a safer</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.329" end="01:13:06.550" style="s2">and maybe even cheaper it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.929" end="01:13:08.409" style="s2">interesting parallel actually that I</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.550" end="01:13:10.510" style="s2">hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t considered until just now</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.409" end="01:13:13.329" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t make sense like market</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.510" end="01:13:17.260" style="s2">evolution evolution of ideas etc it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.329" end="01:13:19.419" style="s2">just the consequences getting it wrong</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.260" end="01:13:22.030" style="s2">in the first place were so severe well</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.419" end="01:13:24.459" style="s2">you know the breakdown processes is</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.030" end="01:13:26.199" style="s2">pretty chaotic I mean we saw that when</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.459" end="01:13:27.999" style="s2">the printing press broke up you know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.199" end="01:13:29.919" style="s2">Catholic Church and feudalism and</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.999" end="01:13:32.229" style="s2">instead in motion a series of changes</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.919" end="01:13:33.939" style="s2">that you know built the modern world you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.229" end="01:13:37.659" style="s2">know built science and built the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.939" end="01:13:40.209" style="s2">bureaucratic state built the the global</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.659" end="01:13:41.800" style="s2">financial system as we see it and all</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.209" end="01:13:45.879" style="s2">from that little printing press you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.800" end="01:13:47.559" style="s2">just but the you know one of the big</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.879" end="01:13:51.239" style="s2">trends that we&#39;re dealing with now and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.559" end="01:13:54.459" style="s2">you&#39;re taking advantage that is the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.239" end="01:13:57.369" style="s2">this tribal thing is that you try being</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.459" end="01:14:00.129" style="s2">up is a good thing said we&#39;re not solid</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.369" end="01:14:03.070" style="s2">it we&#39;re not individuals anymore like we</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.129" end="01:14:05.709" style="s2">were after the printing press when we</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.070" end="01:14:07.780" style="s2">think in isolation we we learn in</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.709" end="01:14:10.389" style="s2">isolation by reading and and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.780" end="01:14:12.579" style="s2">we take a stand as individuals is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.389" end="01:14:16.090" style="s2">we&#39;re increasingly part of a group and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.579" end="01:14:19.780" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of alien but it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.090" end="01:14:21.730" style="s2">survivable in this environment you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.780" end="01:14:23.559" style="s2">if there&#39;s a lot of comfort in actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.730" end="01:14:26.440" style="s2">having other people who are around you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.559" end="01:14:28.539" style="s2">that will will back you up and we all</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.440" end="01:14:32.679" style="s2">miss that we all like we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.539" end="01:14:35.289" style="s2">wanted I mean you know it&#39;s this is this</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.679" end="01:14:37.059" style="s2">like this missing limb that until</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.289" end="01:14:39.880" style="s2">recently you know you didn&#39;t really feel</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.059" end="01:14:41.139" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t you know we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.880" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">in a different world and now in this</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.139" end="01:14:43.780" style="s2">kind of more a little more chaotic world</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:46.059" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to feel that this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.780" end="01:14:50.559" style="s2">this phantom limb problem yeah like the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.059" end="01:14:52.900" style="s2">lack of this kind of tribal context that</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.559" end="01:14:55.150" style="s2">helps you know stabilize your life and</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.900" end="01:14:56.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not all done out and they open</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.150" end="01:14:58.599" style="s2">I&#39;m you know it&#39;s not done through just</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.650" end="01:14:59.949" style="s2">friend networks though you know friend</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.599" end="01:15:01.989" style="s2">networks and followers and stuff are</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.949" end="01:15:03.730" style="s2">great for vetting information and</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.989" end="01:15:06.270" style="s2">introducing you to these people but</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.730" end="01:15:08.619" style="s2">these people that are this backplane is</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.270" end="01:15:10.900" style="s2">its key to getting through this intact</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.619" end="01:15:12.969" style="s2">yeah I agree a hundred percent this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.900" end="01:15:15.969" style="s2">basically one of the fundamental premise</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.969" end="01:15:17.889" style="s2">underlying the the limo order and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.969" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">know tell them we uh we have a hundred</p>

<p begin="01:15:33.900" end="01:15:38.530" style="s2">we&#39;re doing like a logic class like just</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.520" end="01:15:41.050" style="s2">how to think rationally and clearly we</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.530" end="01:15:42.789" style="s2">have an active sense making apparatus</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.050" end="01:15:44.710" style="s2">that&#39;s constantly processing information</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.789" end="01:15:47.170" style="s2">and crowd sourcing and putting it</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.710" end="01:15:49.270" style="s2">together into a useful and actionable</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.170" end="01:15:52.119" style="s2">actionable information in fact you know</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.460" end="01:16:11.079" style="s2">that were saved just from the right our</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.349" end="01:16:12.909" style="s2">sense making capabilities is so big I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.079" end="01:16:15.730" style="s2">not even gonna say it on the podcast</p>

<p begin="01:18:03.670" end="01:18:08.440" style="s2">political networks the open source</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.090" end="01:18:10.750" style="s2">politics that we find ourselves in where</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.440" end="01:18:13.300" style="s2">where are we today what happened before</p>

<p begin="01:18:13.300" end="01:18:19.420" style="s2">moving forward this is okay so you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.420" end="01:18:22.269" style="s2">my first thing when I start or when I</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.420" end="01:18:25.340" style="s2">started writing and as</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.269" end="01:18:27.139" style="s2">independent person online and and with</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.340" end="01:18:30.349" style="s2">my global Gorillaz blog and then my book</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.139" end="01:18:32.690" style="s2">and then this I started focusing in on</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.349" end="01:18:34.190" style="s2">fourth-generation warfare and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.690" end="01:18:38.449" style="s2">premise behind that is that we were</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.190" end="01:18:41.239" style="s2">going reversing the peace of westphalia</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.449" end="01:18:44.360" style="s2">were going you know to the the error</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.239" end="01:18:47.900" style="s2">that existed before that whether the</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.360" end="01:18:51.500" style="s2">nation-state was in decline but well</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.900" end="01:18:55.809" style="s2">what we saw as like this online world</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.500" end="01:18:58.489" style="s2">exploded is that it was more just a</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.809" end="01:19:02.030" style="s2">seminal event brought on by technology</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.489" end="01:19:05.090" style="s2">that was setting in motion a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.030" end="01:19:08.690" style="s2">different forces creating new things and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.090" end="01:19:09.980" style="s2">shaking up the old order kind of just</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.690" end="01:19:13.550" style="s2">like the the printing press did like we</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.980" end="01:19:15.230" style="s2">mentioned earlier and that the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.550" end="01:19:16.639" style="s2">breakup that of the nation-state that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.230" end="01:19:19.280" style="s2">saw in the fourth generation warfare the</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.639" end="01:19:23.300" style="s2">primary loyalty isn&#39;t like developing as</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.280" end="01:19:24.860" style="s2">in opposition to that was very similar</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.300" end="01:19:27.849" style="s2">to what was going on with the Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.860" end="01:19:29.869" style="s2">Church and and and the feudal system</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.849" end="01:19:31.340" style="s2">when when the printing press made it</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.869" end="01:19:32.960" style="s2">possible to you know start here on</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.340" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">Church I mean actually have a Bible in</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.960" end="01:19:40.579" style="s2">hand right um so what we&#39;re seeing now</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:43.750" style="s2">is some you know I&#39;ve been talking a lot</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.579" end="01:19:46.010" style="s2">about networks and and network politics</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.750" end="01:19:48.079" style="s2">you know I started with this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.010" end="01:19:52.400" style="s2">there are three different networks</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.079" end="01:19:53.989" style="s2">competing that this network system the</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.400" end="01:19:56.630" style="s2">social networking system plus everything</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.989" end="01:19:58.190" style="s2">else associated with it online was a new</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.630" end="01:20:00.079" style="s2">decision-making system a new social</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.190" end="01:20:02.960" style="s2">decision-making system and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.079" end="01:20:04.699" style="s2">learning how to use it effectively to go</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.960" end="01:20:07.030" style="s2">along with you know markets and</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.699" end="01:20:09.679" style="s2">bureaucracies and and kind of tribal</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.030" end="01:20:12.949" style="s2">cohesion cohesion in the form of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.679" end="01:20:14.510" style="s2">nationalism those systems work well up</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.949" end="01:20:17.570" style="s2">to the end of the 20th century and this</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.510" end="01:20:20.030" style="s2">one was being added so we were in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.570" end="01:20:21.050" style="s2">kind of training wheels phase or no</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.030" end="01:20:23.480" style="s2">training wheels because we were falling</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.050" end="01:20:27.409" style="s2">over all the time right and so okay so</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.480" end="01:20:29.269" style="s2">he hit three big forces and forced on</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.409" end="01:20:30.850" style="s2">the right force on the left and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.269" end="01:20:34.510" style="s2">establishment</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.850" end="01:20:37.210" style="s2">and the force on the right it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.510" end="01:20:39.910" style="s2">kind of a classic conservative force it</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.210" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">was in this networked world it had a</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.910" end="01:20:46.450" style="s2">different kind of form it was disruption</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:48.400" style="s2">they broke down consensus or old</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.450" end="01:20:51.550" style="s2">consensus so old ways of doing things</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:54.550" style="s2">that were locked in place so Kitely we</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.550" end="01:20:58.450" style="s2">couldn&#39;t even address them because those</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.550" end="01:21:00.220" style="s2">assumptions were in not if you know not</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.450" end="01:21:02.380" style="s2">questionable right all right stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.220" end="01:21:03.940" style="s2">trade it&#39;s like right of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.380" end="01:21:07.420" style="s2">gonna do this trade trade has to work</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.940" end="01:21:08.830" style="s2">this way or you know a you know of</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.420" end="01:21:09.850" style="s2">course you know we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.830" end="01:21:11.080" style="s2">change anything having to do with</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.850" end="01:21:12.580" style="s2">immigration of course we&#39;ve got to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.080" end="01:21:14.110" style="s2">this or that it has to be this way</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.580" end="01:21:16.600" style="s2">because this is the way we&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.110" end="01:21:18.100" style="s2">done it and you see like little versions</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.600" end="01:21:21.790" style="s2">of that with like Eric Weinstein thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.100" end="01:21:23.260" style="s2">about the rat testing I think wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.790" end="01:21:25.660" style="s2">even change that basic little thing in</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.260" end="01:21:28.030" style="s2">the rat testing even though it was shown</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.660" end="01:21:29.740" style="s2">that those rats were biasing the results</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.030" end="01:21:31.600" style="s2">because it was such a core assumption</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.740" end="01:21:34.360" style="s2">right all this other research and</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:36.100" style="s2">unraveling it was incomprehensible so</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.360" end="01:21:37.870" style="s2">what so the right forget it</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.100" end="01:21:41.590" style="s2">yeah the right formed kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.870" end="01:21:44.050" style="s2">disruption kind of little little chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.590" end="01:21:46.780" style="s2">at times but you know take those things</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.050" end="01:21:50.290" style="s2">on and they formed there was a form of</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.780" end="01:21:51.700" style="s2">warfare that allowed them to actually do</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.290" end="01:21:53.350" style="s2">a successfully online a kind of a form</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.700" end="01:21:54.910" style="s2">of maneuver warfare where you get a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.350" end="01:21:56.620" style="s2">rapidly changing topics and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.910" end="01:21:58.990" style="s2">constantly attacking it from ready for</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.620" end="01:22:01.270" style="s2">any different directions and that was</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.990" end="01:22:03.160" style="s2">Trump&#39;s that was the network that put</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.270" end="01:22:05.800" style="s2">Trump in office and Trump was more of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.160" end="01:22:08.080" style="s2">conduit for making that happen then the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.800" end="01:22:14.530" style="s2">actual classic candidate in the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.080" end="01:22:15.970" style="s2">literary world and what the assumption</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.530" end="01:22:17.590" style="s2">was and my part was that there was going</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.970" end="01:22:20.710" style="s2">to be a challenge on the left and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.590" end="01:22:23.910" style="s2">left wasn&#39;t the classic like how much</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.710" end="01:22:29.550" style="s2">more government spending there would be</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.910" end="01:22:31.660" style="s2">it was more trying to set up a consensus</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.550" end="01:22:33.850" style="s2">consensus that we can all agree on and</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.660" end="01:22:38.520" style="s2">consensus forming around a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.850" end="01:22:40.810" style="s2">just as really basic gut issues and</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.520" end="01:22:42.220" style="s2">optimally if you could form a consensus</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.810" end="01:22:43.280" style="s2">is that you can do other things as a</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.220" end="01:22:45.619" style="s2">group and</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.280" end="01:22:47.059" style="s2">future right now if you ask anyone I</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.619" end="01:22:49.909" style="s2">mean I did a couple polls on that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.059" end="01:22:52.159" style="s2">it and I vote you know I asked you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.909" end="01:22:55.130" style="s2">what do we agree on as a country mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.159" end="01:22:57.469" style="s2">and nobody can come up with anything you</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.130" end="01:23:00.260" style="s2">know they like potato chips or something</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.469" end="01:23:04.969" style="s2">like football but but even that&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.260" end="01:23:06.260" style="s2">as universal as it was so um um in terms</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.969" end="01:23:08.809" style="s2">of doing anything as a government or</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.260" end="01:23:13.789" style="s2">doing anything you know together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.809" end="01:23:15.380" style="s2">pretty much all over the map so what we</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.789" end="01:23:18.469" style="s2">need to have in order to work as a group</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.380" end="01:23:19.760" style="s2">though is is is that consensus and I was</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.469" end="01:23:23.510" style="s2">hoping you&#39;d see some of that on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.760" end="01:23:25.940" style="s2">left like even if you know most people</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.510" end="01:23:27.440" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t agree with it agree</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.940" end="01:23:29.570" style="s2">that you know health care should be some</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.440" end="01:23:31.130" style="s2">kind of right you know we should have at</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.570" end="01:23:32.750" style="s2">least a basic level of health care for</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.130" end="01:23:33.980" style="s2">people yeah you shouldn&#39;t be able it</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.750" end="01:23:35.829" style="s2">just because you don&#39;t have a dollar in</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.980" end="01:23:38.949" style="s2">your pocket you know you shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.829" end="01:23:43.130" style="s2">denied getting some basic health care</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.949" end="01:23:45.170" style="s2">and if you frame it like that it could</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.130" end="01:23:47.179" style="s2">people can agree on it and then you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.170" end="01:23:49.219" style="s2">start to build policy but we have we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.179" end="01:23:50.510" style="s2">not even getting you know we&#39;re we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.219" end="01:23:52.039" style="s2">been talking more at the policy level</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.510" end="01:23:53.809" style="s2">which is hiring the stack and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.039" end="01:23:55.670" style="s2">that&#39;s not something we can address so</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.809" end="01:23:57.289" style="s2">what we had is like Sanders and Warren</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.670" end="01:23:59.150" style="s2">and it looked early on that they were</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.289" end="01:24:03.500" style="s2">gonna be able to do something along that</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.150" end="01:24:06.429" style="s2">vein I mean Warren was great at these</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.500" end="01:24:11.059" style="s2">big sweeping moral arguments right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.429" end="01:24:12.710" style="s2">and you know mostly focusing her initial</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.059" end="01:24:15.590" style="s2">work was all focused on the family and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.710" end="01:24:17.150" style="s2">that and and family incomes and how it</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.590" end="01:24:20.360" style="s2">was impossible for them to get ahead</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.150" end="01:24:22.429" style="s2">because of these cost structures and if</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.360" end="01:24:24.530" style="s2">she had based her you know sweeping</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.429" end="01:24:28.010" style="s2">moral claims based on that she probably</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.530" end="01:24:30.079" style="s2">would have been a winner and the network</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.010" end="01:24:33.500" style="s2">was could have formed around her and</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.079" end="01:24:36.289" style="s2">what happened is that the the network</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.500" end="01:24:37.520" style="s2">was divided into two pieces at Fort the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.289" end="01:24:39.619" style="s2">network there was a posting trump the</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.520" end="01:24:43.340" style="s2">resistance forked into two pieces one in</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.619" end="01:24:45.289" style="s2">behind sanders who was talking in more</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.340" end="01:24:47.239" style="s2">sweeping terms using the night made us</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.289" end="01:24:49.909" style="s2">kind of label it was it was had some</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.239" end="01:24:52.519" style="s2">good pieces to it but it was still tied</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.909" end="01:24:55.130" style="s2">to a lot of older policies and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.519" end="01:24:57.750" style="s2">warren was more particularly she was in</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.130" end="01:25:00.370" style="s2">she dived into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.750" end="01:25:03.670" style="s2">intersectional stuff right very heavily</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.370" end="01:25:06.100" style="s2">and that was more divisive you know and</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.670" end="01:25:08.530" style="s2">that&#39;s not building that consensus and</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.100" end="01:25:10.120" style="s2">the civil war between that I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.530" end="01:25:13.090" style="s2">whenever there&#39;s a fork in any network</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.120" end="01:25:14.590" style="s2">it&#39;s usually the most vicious war it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.090" end="01:25:18.010" style="s2">just that they&#39;re constantly there&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.590" end="01:25:22.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not reconcilable and that tanked</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.010" end="01:25:27.910" style="s2">the network left response to this</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.570" end="01:25:31.060" style="s2">election and so the establishment which</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.910" end="01:25:33.160" style="s2">is the third party uses their control</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.060" end="01:25:36.960" style="s2">over the existing networks the legacy</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.160" end="01:25:41.200" style="s2">media that the their ability to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.960" end="01:25:43.870" style="s2">influence governments and the like or</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.200" end="01:25:49.240" style="s2">you know local state and local level</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.870" end="01:25:51.160" style="s2">as kind of a bludgeon well they were</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.240" end="01:25:54.280" style="s2">able to consolidate based on their fear</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.160" end="01:25:55.720" style="s2">that Sanders or would take over the</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.280" end="01:25:59.050" style="s2">party and then they were able to fight</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.720" end="01:26:00.700" style="s2">them off and it&#39;s been successful so now</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.050" end="01:26:02.560" style="s2">we have a kind of a dysfunctional system</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.700" end="01:26:04.030" style="s2">we have like a an establishment</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.560" end="01:26:06.970" style="s2">candidate and the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.030" end="01:26:08.170" style="s2">establishment just like same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.970" end="01:26:10.260" style="s2">face the kind of the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.170" end="01:26:15.060" style="s2">right after the Reformation started is</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.260" end="01:26:20.080" style="s2">why do you exist you know why are we</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.060" end="01:26:21.960" style="s2">supporting you and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.080" end="01:26:26.410" style="s2">established market it says basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.960" end="01:26:30.100" style="s2">we&#39;re not them or we can bring you back</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.410" end="01:26:31.900" style="s2">to where we were or you know in Biden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.100" end="01:26:33.310" style="s2">Casey says I&#39;m more electable and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.900" end="01:26:34.660" style="s2">it that&#39;s the extent of their entire</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.310" end="01:26:36.220" style="s2">argument they don&#39;t they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.660" end="01:26:39.730" style="s2">anything to do any direction they want</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.220" end="01:26:45.310" style="s2">to take us other than back no real</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.730" end="01:26:48.670" style="s2">reason no real grievance other than you</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.310" end="01:26:50.020" style="s2">know opposition to Trump brand right so</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.670" end="01:26:53.610" style="s2">they&#39;re just so nothing it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.020" end="01:26:53.610" style="s2">nothing burger kind of thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.690" end="01:26:58.160" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the situation</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.010" end="01:27:00.450" style="s2">we&#39;re in it&#39;s like this empty</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.160" end="01:27:04.020" style="s2">establishment trying to rally around a</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.450" end="01:27:07.560" style="s2">candidate up against the networked right</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.020" end="01:27:09.110" style="s2">which Sela seems vibrant I mean they</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.560" end="01:27:12.660" style="s2">tried to take him down through legal</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.110" end="01:27:14.580" style="s2">campaigns you know all that all the you</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.660" end="01:27:16.290" style="s2">know I was writing two years ago that</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.580" end="01:27:19.050" style="s2">the you know all of this stuff wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.290" end="01:27:21.650" style="s2">work because you know the the Russia</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.050" end="01:27:25.890" style="s2">Russia Gate stuff and then the follow on</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.650" end="01:27:28.500" style="s2">impeachment wouldn&#39;t work because Trump</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.890" end="01:27:30.510" style="s2">is immune to that because he&#39;s he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.500" end="01:27:32.040" style="s2">conduit for the network so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.510" end="01:27:33.410" style="s2">at you know if you tech the person the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.040" end="01:27:35.880" style="s2">person is really not there</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.410" end="01:27:38.040" style="s2">he&#39;s just the conduit for the network so</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.880" end="01:27:40.470" style="s2">that every attack you make on him passes</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.040" end="01:27:43.020" style="s2">right through it right you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.470" end="01:27:46.140" style="s2">is exactly what happened it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.020" end="01:27:47.520" style="s2">legal process it was a way of damaging</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.140" end="01:27:50.190" style="s2">there&#39;s supposed to be a way of</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.520" end="01:27:52.140" style="s2">discrediting or D legitimizing the</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.190" end="01:27:54.150" style="s2">target and it didn&#39;t have the intended</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.140" end="01:27:56.730" style="s2">effect and Trump ended the whole process</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.150" end="01:27:58.560" style="s2">up the way forty six percent approval</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.730" end="01:28:00.480" style="s2">really the highest he&#39;s been since at</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.560" end="01:28:02.580" style="s2">the beginning of the presidency right so</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.480" end="01:28:04.530" style="s2">um so now we&#39;re going to coming up on</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.580" end="01:28:07.440" style="s2">election where there&#39;s not a network</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.530" end="01:28:10.550" style="s2">left is gonna go sulk for a while and</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.440" end="01:28:13.800" style="s2">try to figure out what is supposed to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.550" end="01:28:16.680" style="s2">and they may end up tanking it by not</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.800" end="01:28:18.750" style="s2">supporting Biden and then you have you</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.680" end="01:28:22.110" style="s2">know Biden versus Trump up in the you</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.750" end="01:28:24.720" style="s2">know establishment versus network great</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.110" end="01:28:26.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s my that&#39;s my nutshell it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.720" end="01:28:28.350" style="s2">gonna be interesting to see the inside</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.040" end="01:28:32.000" style="s2">now it&#39;s it would have been more</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.350" end="01:28:34.800" style="s2">interesting if the network left had</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.000" end="01:28:36.930" style="s2">consolidated and taken over the</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:38.640" style="s2">Democratic Party as decisively as the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.930" end="01:28:40.850" style="s2">network right did with the Republicans</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.640" end="01:28:40.850" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.550" end="01:28:45.150" style="s2">they just weren&#39;t able they just weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.139" end="01:28:49.949" style="s2">able to pull it off they just weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.150" end="01:28:52.769" style="s2">well and and I would say good good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.949" end="01:28:54.690" style="s2">you know partially because their their</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.769" end="01:28:57.210" style="s2">moral compass is something that I find</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.690" end="01:28:59.369" style="s2">abhorrent and I find you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.210" end="01:29:01.889" style="s2">incompatible with American values in</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.369" end="01:29:03.210" style="s2">general and so you know from a purely</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.889" end="01:29:05.039" style="s2">academic standpoint it would have been</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.210" end="01:29:07.199" style="s2">interesting to see how the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.039" end="01:29:09.150" style="s2">Party would have been hijacked however</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.199" end="01:29:10.829" style="s2">I&#39;m pleased with them running an</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.150" end="01:29:13.409" style="s2">establishment candidate who&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.829" end="01:29:15.300" style="s2">Hillary who&#39;s basically Obama who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.409" end="01:29:18.329" style="s2">basically Bush is basically Clinton and</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.300" end="01:29:21.449" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very easy campaign I think for</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.329" end="01:29:24.780" style="s2">Donald Trump to continue basically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.449" end="01:29:26.610" style="s2">just 2016 all over again and most of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.780" end="01:29:28.380" style="s2">factors that were at play which drove</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.610" end="01:29:31.409" style="s2">Trump to the presidency are still in</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.380" end="01:29:34.289" style="s2">play either their trends that negatively</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.409" end="01:29:37.190" style="s2">we&#39;re trending downward that favored him</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.289" end="01:29:39.539" style="s2">or they were trends that were negatively</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.190" end="01:29:43.050" style="s2">going negative that he has reversed</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.539" end="01:29:44.610" style="s2">which also that in favor him too so I</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.050" end="01:29:47.190" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a pretty good chance</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.610" end="01:29:49.280" style="s2">that he gets reelected it will be</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.190" end="01:29:51.989" style="s2">interesting to see what the Bernie</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.280" end="01:29:54.349" style="s2">supporters do I do know that there were</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.989" end="01:29:57.300" style="s2">a number of people who supported Bernie</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.349" end="01:29:59.880" style="s2">in 2016 who then crossed over to Trump</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.300" end="01:30:01.469" style="s2">after the DNC you know the convention</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.880" end="01:30:03.749" style="s2">and all the nonsense that went on there</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.469" end="01:30:05.940" style="s2">and and I&#39;ve come to realize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.749" end="01:30:09.239" style="s2">because the network left and the network</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.940" end="01:30:12.059" style="s2">right have the same enemy which is the</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.239" end="01:30:13.679" style="s2">establishment it&#39;s just once you defeat</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.059" end="01:30:16.860" style="s2">the establishment what you do after that</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.679" end="01:30:19.230" style="s2">is it&#39;s completely different policies</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.860" end="01:30:22.980" style="s2">but you know the the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.230" end="01:30:26.190" style="s2">controlled by a cabal of neo liberal</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.980" end="01:30:28.949" style="s2">minded corporatist basically from both</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.190" end="01:30:31.679" style="s2">the right and the left is is sounded</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.949" end="01:30:34.079" style="s2">before like a weird conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.679" end="01:30:35.219" style="s2">but it&#39;s so plainly obvious and all</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.079" end="01:30:38.909" style="s2">these issues we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.219" end="01:30:42.179" style="s2">today are a result of that cabal the</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.909" end="01:30:45.449" style="s2">China Ascension the global trade the the</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.179" end="01:30:47.489" style="s2">neutering of our military capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.449" end="01:30:50.360" style="s2">manufacturing capabilities and just gosh</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.489" end="01:30:53.210" style="s2">darn friggin self-help and medical</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.360" end="01:30:56.659" style="s2">CAIR capabilities all of these are a</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.210" end="01:30:59.449" style="s2">result of the last four decades of</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.659" end="01:31:00.469" style="s2">basically unified control even though</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.449" end="01:31:03.409" style="s2">they both came from the right in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.469" end="01:31:05.750" style="s2">left yeah it also points to probably</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.409" end="01:31:08.300" style="s2">what who the next candidate to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.750" end="01:31:10.130" style="s2">replace Trump would be mmm it&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.300" end="01:31:13.580" style="s2">think right now it looks like Tucker</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.130" end="01:31:15.380" style="s2">Carlson I mean I me truly he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.580" end="01:31:17.300" style="s2">just he hits it like for instance</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.380" end="01:31:18.530" style="s2">bringing back medical manufacturing I</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.300" end="01:31:21.770" style="s2">was thinking that I wrote about it and</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.530" end="01:31:24.199" style="s2">then I saw he had a show on that is like</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.770" end="01:31:26.210" style="s2">that&#39;s right that seems to hit these</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.199" end="01:31:29.030" style="s2">notes constantly he&#39;s got a better ear</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.210" end="01:31:30.830" style="s2">for it then Trump I mean he&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.030" end="01:31:33.500" style="s2">good at the disruption element and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.830" end="01:31:36.489" style="s2">changing the fast transients but I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.500" end="01:31:39.650" style="s2">he has a better ear for figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.489" end="01:31:42.469" style="s2">where that where the pressure points are</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.650" end="01:31:43.909" style="s2">but that&#39;s me I mean this I I think I</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.469" end="01:31:45.469" style="s2">don&#39;t see anyone else I could pull it</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.909" end="01:31:46.670" style="s2">off I think here I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.469" end="01:31:50.929" style="s2">Tucker Carlson would make a fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.670" end="01:31:54.110" style="s2">candidate he he may be even better</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.929" end="01:31:56.900" style="s2">public speaker and order then then Trump</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.110" end="01:31:58.699" style="s2">the way he can get people riled up and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.900" end="01:32:00.530" style="s2">do appreciate and you know he does have</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.699" end="01:32:02.420" style="s2">a network of people scouring all of</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.530" end="01:32:05.510" style="s2">social media all of our work your work</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.420" end="01:32:07.040" style="s2">so if you if you say something and two</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.510" end="01:32:09.949" style="s2">days later ends up on Tucker Carlson</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.040" end="01:32:12.050" style="s2">there&#39;s less than zero chance sit there</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.949" end="01:32:14.389" style="s2">they&#39;re watching and observing and and</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.050" end="01:32:16.460" style="s2">and taking information from but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.389" end="01:32:20.060" style="s2">kind of a formal he&#39;s formalized to</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.460" end="01:32:21.860" style="s2">process it of the network feeding the</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.060" end="01:32:23.840" style="s2">candidate just like Trump was an</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.860" end="01:32:25.310" style="s2">informal version of that you just what</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.840" end="01:32:27.710" style="s2">he happen to see where they happened to</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.310" end="01:32:29.510" style="s2">pick up but the Carlson&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.710" end="01:32:31.159" style="s2">formalized that process he&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.510" end="01:32:33.260" style="s2">the good ideas to percolate pop up out</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.159" end="01:32:35.060" style="s2">of this open source network it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.260" end="01:32:37.520" style="s2">interesting I mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.060" end="01:32:39.560" style="s2">you know and exactly the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.520" end="01:32:41.239" style="s2">left it the network left at least the</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.560" end="01:32:42.710" style="s2">candidates that ran I mean there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.239" end="01:32:44.780" style="s2">way Biden would look at anything on from</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.710" end="01:32:48.830" style="s2">Twitter and take it as as a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.780" end="01:32:52.219" style="s2">you know or or Sanders or even Warren</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.830" end="01:32:54.679" style="s2">you know I unless Warren had a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.219" end="01:32:56.210" style="s2">not invented here kind of thing if she</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.679" end="01:32:59.330" style="s2">didn&#39;t come up with the policy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.210" end="01:33:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not good enough right so I I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.330" end="01:33:02.860" style="s2">that the some of those people on network</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.280" end="01:33:04.630" style="s2">left did take a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.860" end="01:33:07.239" style="s2">Twitter too seriously which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.630" end="01:33:09.010" style="s2">the woke the woke element you know right</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.239" end="01:33:12.520" style="s2">when they were all on stage and Bernie</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.010" end="01:33:15.580" style="s2">Sanders goes America is racist from top</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.520" end="01:33:17.230" style="s2">to bottom and and Elizabeth Warren says</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.580" end="01:33:20.469" style="s2">racism is everywhere and getting worse</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.230" end="01:33:21.940" style="s2">every single day I&#39;m like wait the only</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.469" end="01:33:23.679" style="s2">place they&#39;re getting that from is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.940" end="01:33:25.960" style="s2">intersectional left the online</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.679" end="01:33:28.600" style="s2">intersectional left it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.960" end="01:33:32.110" style="s2">obviously not based in fact but it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.600" end="01:33:34.570" style="s2">interesting to see how you know I call</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.110" end="01:33:37.270" style="s2">her mom Amy Amy mom she fell in line</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.570" end="01:33:39.600" style="s2">mayor Pete fell in line they all fell in</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.270" end="01:33:42.040" style="s2">line behind Biden who is by all accounts</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.600" end="01:33:44.020" style="s2">clearly deteriorating right before our</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.040" end="01:33:47.050" style="s2">very eyes he&#39;s not the same guy that he</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.020" end="01:33:49.030" style="s2">used to be the cynic the deep deep cynic</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.050" end="01:33:50.949" style="s2">in me thinks that Obama understood this</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.030" end="01:33:53.889" style="s2">they&#39;re throwing a sacrificial lamb out</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.949" end="01:33:54.790" style="s2">to be slaughtered here and saving the</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.889" end="01:33:57.820" style="s2">Michelle Obama</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.790" end="01:34:00.040" style="s2">you know campaign for 2024 you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.820" end="01:34:01.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the deeply cynical part of me and</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.040" end="01:34:04.119" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s right I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.510" end="01:34:06.940" style="s2">time will tell I will definitely tell ya</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.119" end="01:34:09.580" style="s2">a folded yesterday joined the Biden</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.940" end="01:34:11.290" style="s2">train yeah I was like whoa yeah if I</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.580" end="01:34:13.719" style="s2">were him I would just sat it out right</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.290" end="01:34:15.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting to see what</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.719" end="01:34:17.500" style="s2">power gets wielded behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.460" end="01:34:19.659" style="s2">obviously there and it makes all of them</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.500" end="01:34:21.100" style="s2">sound like a bunch of hypocritic horses</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.659" end="01:34:22.630" style="s2">asses because they just stand there</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.100" end="01:34:23.860" style="s2">banging each other over the head and now</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.630" end="01:34:27.070" style="s2">they&#39;re like this guy&#39;s the greatest you</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.860" end="01:34:29.380" style="s2">should be president but yeah the 22</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.070" end="01:34:31.179" style="s2">clearly don&#39;t believe it right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.380" end="01:34:32.830" style="s2">going okay he&#39;d make a great president</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.179" end="01:34:36.159" style="s2">even though you know it you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.830" end="01:34:38.320" style="s2">not true right I can&#39;t honestly I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.159" end="01:34:40.900" style="s2">understand some of that but I do know</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.320" end="01:34:43.420" style="s2">that Trump versus Biden is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.900" end="01:34:45.670" style="s2">very similar to 2016 Biden I think is</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.420" end="01:34:48.280" style="s2">even less of a qualified candidate not</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.670" end="01:34:51.340" style="s2">qualified but a weaker candidate than</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.280" end="01:34:52.449" style="s2">Hillary was and I don&#39;t suspect the</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.340" end="01:34:54.460" style="s2">outcomes gonna be any different</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.449" end="01:34:56.260" style="s2">interesting to bring up Tucker Carlson</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.460" end="01:34:59.139" style="s2">2024 I think I could get behind that</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.260" end="01:35:00.850" style="s2">myself yeah it seems like it natural it</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.139" end="01:35:03.940" style="s2">seems like a kind of a shoe and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.850" end="01:35:05.350" style="s2">that kind of it and the way candidates</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.940" end="01:35:06.820" style="s2">are vetted now is that they&#39;re out in</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.350" end="01:35:09.580" style="s2">public running their own show right</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.820" end="01:35:11.199" style="s2">right right that&#39;s where you start well</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.580" end="01:35:12.760" style="s2">you got your network and you go from</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.199" end="01:35:14.409" style="s2">there yeah you gotta bring your own</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.760" end="01:35:16.360" style="s2">network and you can say that about</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.409" end="01:35:18.910" style="s2">basically any industry</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.360" end="01:35:21.070" style="s2">at this brain so I&#39;ve been able to do</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.910" end="01:35:23.260" style="s2">that with just content creation and and</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.070" end="01:35:25.240" style="s2">and being an author and a writer you</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.260" end="01:35:27.040" style="s2">know if you build your audience then you</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.240" end="01:35:28.510" style="s2">bring that audience to other endeavors</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.040" end="01:35:31.240" style="s2">and people would then want to work with</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.510" end="01:35:33.820" style="s2">you if you have the audience power it</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.240" end="01:35:35.980" style="s2">then feeds on itself and you do a whole</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.820" end="01:35:38.500" style="s2">podcast on how to develop that audience</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.980" end="01:35:41.590" style="s2">power sometimes it&#39;s the straightest of</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.500" end="01:35:44.320" style="s2">lines yeah that&#39;s also the way we you</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.590" end="01:35:46.420" style="s2">build this a small business now I mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.320" end="01:35:49.300" style="s2">you know if like there&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.420" end="01:35:50.980" style="s2">example of you know jeans made to order</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.300" end="01:35:53.320" style="s2">there was a little company that had</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.980" end="01:35:57.310" style="s2">these like small runs of jeans and they</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.320" end="01:35:58.840" style="s2">would do maybe 200 pair right and they</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.310" end="01:36:00.070" style="s2">were pretty unique if you&#39;re buying them</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.840" end="01:36:02.860" style="s2">in a city you probably be the only guy</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.070" end="01:36:04.570" style="s2">in the city with those jeans and it had</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.860" end="01:36:06.190" style="s2">its own denim and its own stitching and</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.570" end="01:36:09.850" style="s2">everything else but if they had to do it</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.190" end="01:36:12.130" style="s2">through manufacturing and you know in</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.850" end="01:36:14.200" style="s2">the traditional way you take all the</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.130" end="01:36:15.910" style="s2">risk and then you&#39;d put it through the</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.200" end="01:36:18.160" style="s2">retail chain and the jeans would cost</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.910" end="01:36:19.900" style="s2">300 bucks a pop and so what they did is</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.160" end="01:36:21.580" style="s2">they built a network of people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.900" end="01:36:22.980" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in their jeans and then</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.580" end="01:36:25.540" style="s2">they said okay who wants to buy this</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.980" end="01:36:27.460" style="s2">they describe it they show it they</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.540" end="01:36:28.630" style="s2">prototype it and then they people put up</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.460" end="01:36:30.430" style="s2">their hands and if they got a certain</p>

<p begin="01:39:36.910" end="01:39:42.370" style="s2">it is is has become basically the the</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.250" end="01:39:44.320" style="s2">entire thrust of my life and it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.370" end="01:39:45.790" style="s2">a fun and interesting and exciting place</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.320" end="01:39:48.640" style="s2">to be and the fact that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.790" end="01:39:51.880" style="s2">positive outcomes is just incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.640" end="01:39:53.920" style="s2">rewarding and you know it all comes from</p>

<p begin="01:39:53.920" end="01:39:58.330" style="s2">comes from you know being proactive in</p>

<p begin="01:40:32.560" end="01:40:38.770" style="s2">man to the kind of the tribal man it was</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.660" end="01:40:40.840" style="s2">like moving from you know dealing with</p>
