<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.310" style="s2">so unless you had a topic I thought of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.370" end="00:00:08.660" style="s2">topic that might be very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:10.769" style="s2">you and me and also helpful to me so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.660" end="00:00:14.120" style="s2">it&#39;s something I might be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.769" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">and that is like this this thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.120" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">trying to do the insight symposium we</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">can call it and the different ways that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:37.530" style="s2">people understand what this I call it</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">kalev insight work is so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.530" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">use a term that can stand in for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.579" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">different types of methodologies people</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">have been using so I know Terry patent</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:51.930" style="s2">he&#39;s got a book he calls it trans</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:56.600" style="s2">rhetorical intersubjective practice then</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.930" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">they&#39;re circling and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.600" end="00:01:04.309" style="s2">collective presence in this what RIA bet</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">calls it there you know I know that gtc</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.309" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">Terry o&#39;fallon and gtc do transform a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">transformative change but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">they have a real specific term for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">group process a lot of people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">developing the wii space that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">one years ago this predates most of most</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">of those people they talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">circle being they actually hypothesized</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:41.060" style="s2">a new mind of a collective entity talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:47.960" style="s2">about the circle being who did that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.060" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">groups in Europe the no one really does</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.960" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">well there are some people still talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:02:00.170" style="s2">about like that but that&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s more of a indigenous or</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.170" end="00:02:06.979" style="s2">magical or kind of a more of a mythical</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:08.330" style="s2">understanding so in Andrew Cohen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.979" end="00:02:14.150" style="s2">evolutionary and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.330" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">he does talk about he doesn&#39;t call it a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.150" end="00:02:18.410" style="s2">transpersonal field but he almost comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">close to talking about it a new cut type</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.410" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">of entity that arises a collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">entity so that would be probably the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">closest to this and so in so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:37.550" style="s2">interesting in this work is that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:39.970" style="s2">it&#39;s the work is at the point where</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.550" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">people are trying to make distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.970" end="00:02:47.540" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve done a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.170" style="s2">of that work or you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.540" end="00:02:54.310" style="s2">that work but maybe just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.170" end="00:02:58.040" style="s2">describe a little bit about how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.310" end="00:03:01.160" style="s2">understand that work or what might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.040" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2">interesting about it I know you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.160" end="00:03:09.320" style="s2">more of an individual kind of journey</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.540" end="00:03:11.540" style="s2">but um so that could be one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.320" end="00:03:13.489" style="s2">could talk about to tell you the truth I</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.540" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know that much about it myself you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:22.370" style="s2">know so but but I I um well let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:28.880" style="s2">with yeah I did why is it interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.370" end="00:03:34.730" style="s2">you it&#39;s interesting to me for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.880" end="00:03:41.090" style="s2">of reasons number one is because people</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.730" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">that I highly respect have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.090" end="00:03:49.160" style="s2">it in ways that are important to me so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">for example they&#39;ll say something really</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.160" end="00:03:55.970" style="s2">new is happening but they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">make distinctions between those versions</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.970" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">of it that are not what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:09.440" style="s2">experienced and can tend to be confused</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.340" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">with what is a new experience so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.440" end="00:04:18.950" style="s2">like a pre trans kind of thing here</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">right and so in there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:27.050" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:34.099" style="s2">around what this new capacity for being</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.050" end="00:04:37.660" style="s2">together is now I have had I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.099" end="00:04:42.740" style="s2">gotten to a lot of these experiences but</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.660" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">most of my experiences I would describe</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.740" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">as subtle energy fields right so subtle</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:53.930" style="s2">energy could be even mass consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:56.990" style="s2">is subtle energy or you know and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.930" end="00:04:58.849" style="s2">saying that these so I respect that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.990" end="00:05:00.909" style="s2">these people can make that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.849" end="00:05:04.009" style="s2">that we&#39;re not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.909" end="00:05:06.680" style="s2">fundamentalist Baptists having a unitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.009" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">experience is primarily a subtle energy</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:09.770" style="s2">experience I mean that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:13.099" style="s2">interesting experience because subtle</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.770" end="00:05:14.870" style="s2">energy can transmit and you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.099" end="00:05:20.509" style="s2">ride those waves and you could have mass</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.870" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">consciousness and so that&#39;s not a path</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.509" end="00:05:26.919" style="s2">that interests me and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">post-war humanists in the end</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.919" end="00:05:30.650" style="s2">postmodernist in the new age thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">that&#39;s really what they&#39;re playing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.650" end="00:05:39.500" style="s2">and not naming it correctly so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:42.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a long tradition of debunking</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.500" end="00:05:46.719" style="s2">spiritual materialism and so for me just</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.770" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">now when this new other thing may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.719" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">arising it&#39;s important to me as I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.880" style="s2">know some kind of investigator you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:05:59.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t know who pointed me the lead</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.880" end="00:06:05.090" style="s2">examiner but the what it may it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.240" end="00:06:07.069" style="s2">interesting to me to look at that from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.090" end="00:06:15.080" style="s2">perspective of being able to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.069" end="00:06:17.719" style="s2">valuable distinctions and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.080" end="00:06:24.229" style="s2">distinctions I think it matters is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.719" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">difference between a group experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.229" end="00:06:31.449" style="s2">that&#39;s primed in such a way that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.500" end="00:06:33.470" style="s2">is alignment around a conceptual object</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.449" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2">that then gets us</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.470" end="00:06:39.230" style="s2">associated with subtle energy field and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">then becomes that group becomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.230" end="00:06:44.210" style="s2">vulnerable to being distracted by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">SEC conceptual object so you could have</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.210" end="00:06:50.060" style="s2">for example groups thinking that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:54.410" style="s2">is a circle being or groups thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:56.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s an authentic self or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.410" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">you know and again distracted by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.600" end="00:07:02.510" style="s2">conceptual object and the experience is</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:05.060" style="s2">not remain at a prot as a practice now</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.510" end="00:07:07.610" style="s2">Terry patents new work said a really a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.060" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">lot of cool things so he said it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.610" end="00:07:12.920" style="s2">praxis you can&#39;t objectify it in and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.270" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">when I see people making those</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.920" end="00:07:16.670" style="s2">distinctions and still believing in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:20.540" style="s2">work or still going forward within the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.670" end="00:07:25.760" style="s2">work then I get more curious so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.540" end="00:07:30.230" style="s2">just a little bit of what I would talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.760" end="00:07:36.760" style="s2">about now I&#39;ve had experiences that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.230" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">would call collective insight but they</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.760" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">have not happened through a ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:54.650" style="s2">process in a large group so and i know</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:57.890" style="s2">some of these experiences have taken</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.650" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">years 12 14 years for some of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.890" end="00:08:04.550" style="s2">people to actually get to the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:08.690" style="s2">there is a different capacity so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.550" end="00:08:16.580" style="s2">want to you know over privilege my</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.690" end="00:08:18.950" style="s2">skepticism because i have not done done</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.580" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">the work and so these people that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.950" end="00:08:24.200" style="s2">doing the work you were asking me this</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">the other day they&#39;re interested for</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.200" end="00:08:30.590" style="s2">some reason in coming together yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:34.940" style="s2">the home territory of somewhat skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.590" end="00:08:39.380" style="s2">right right to do the work together</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.940" end="00:08:41.330" style="s2">which is a performance of the root</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.380" end="00:08:43.880" style="s2">theory in their practice because there</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.330" end="00:08:47.160" style="s2">will be different versions perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.880" end="00:08:51.319" style="s2">versions of what exactly is going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.160" end="00:08:58.740" style="s2">in an opportunity to see if that can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.319" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">moved to the words get tricky because no</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.740" end="00:09:04.769" style="s2">one no one&#39;s saying things move to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">collective agreement because as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.769" end="00:09:11.209" style="s2">it becomes in the experience becomes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">back into the terms and you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.209" end="00:09:16.500" style="s2">perspectival multiplicity falls out</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:20.519" style="s2">again so you can&#39;t capture it with some</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:23.220" style="s2">of these other terms and and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.519" end="00:09:25.889" style="s2">languaging that is interesting to me so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.220" end="00:09:31.100" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of my preamble</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.889" end="00:09:33.959" style="s2">about about this yeah there&#39;s a lot a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.100" end="00:09:38.029" style="s2">lot of ground to cover but you can hear</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.959" end="00:09:45.870" style="s2">the skepticism in the way I&#39;m careful to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.029" end="00:09:48.750" style="s2">I&#39;m not a negative &#39;used you know um but</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.870" end="00:09:56.130" style="s2">I&#39;m like an Iowan you know you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.750" end="00:09:58.889" style="s2">show me show me um so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.130" end="00:10:00.750" style="s2">that&#39;s where I&#39;m at and I hope I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.889" end="00:10:04.189" style="s2">scare anyone away from coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.750" end="00:10:06.569" style="s2">symposium with happened to hear this I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.189" end="00:10:15.300" style="s2">kind of I can&#39;t imagine how you would</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.569" end="00:10:19.410" style="s2">have I I don&#39;t have that much experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.300" end="00:10:23.009" style="s2">with it like or with its whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.410" end="00:10:25.220" style="s2">are and so I would only be speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.009" end="00:10:28.670" style="s2">very limited experience and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.220" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">conjecture and hypothetical distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.670" end="00:10:40.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that would be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:40.550" style="s2">huh yeah I think that um</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.250" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">I think it would be valuable I think we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.680" end="00:11:04.660" style="s2">could talk around it and and use that as</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:09.510" style="s2">a little journey into what either what</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.660" end="00:11:13.930" style="s2">the obstacles are or what the potential</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.510" end="00:11:18.340" style="s2">pitfalls are you know I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.930" end="00:11:20.500" style="s2">I was talking to someone the other day a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.340" end="00:11:22.900" style="s2">mutual friend of ours and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.500" end="00:11:25.780" style="s2">were we were agreeing that some of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.900" end="00:11:28.510" style="s2">is typology so if you tend to be more of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.780" end="00:11:31.420" style="s2">an individualist than this is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.510" end="00:11:37.510" style="s2">necessarily going to be the way you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.420" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">going to you&#39;re going to experience that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.510" end="00:11:43.510" style="s2">that differently but those are some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:47.380" style="s2">the distinctions that I would make okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.510" end="00:11:50.260" style="s2">so mmm you made a distinction earlier</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.380" end="00:11:52.450" style="s2">which I was like very interested in you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.260" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">use the word mass consciousness to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.450" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">describe a subtle energy field that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:01.000" style="s2">happens in groups and I&#39;m wondering and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that there&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.000" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">called collective insight or that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">know all these different leaders of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:09.820" style="s2">group processes are tapping into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.690" end="00:12:11.320" style="s2">same thing even tapping into I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.820" end="00:12:13.660" style="s2">even know what language to use yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.320" end="00:12:15.220" style="s2">because I right it sucks yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.660" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">different ways of characterizing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.220" end="00:12:19.720" style="s2">happening here and what&#39;s happened that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:21.850" style="s2">many different things might be happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.720" end="00:12:24.990" style="s2">but I&#39;m wondering why you think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.850" end="00:12:27.430" style="s2">kind what you said is mass consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.990" end="00:12:30.550" style="s2">first of all what&#39;s that and why is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:33.940" style="s2">not what these people are doing right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.550" end="00:12:36.370" style="s2">that would be I&#39;m certainly not accusing</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.940" end="00:12:39.940" style="s2">any of these people of doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.370" end="00:12:43.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the far end of what nobody wants</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.940" end="00:12:45.430" style="s2">to be doing but there is an experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.240" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">that people and groups can have I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.430" end="00:12:49.720" style="s2">call it an a subtle energy experience I</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">mean you walk into a funeral home and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.720" end="00:12:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;ll hit you right so what is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:57.209" style="s2">that&#39;s a transmission of a subtle energy</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.400" end="00:13:00.680" style="s2">it with a certain emotional content and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.209" end="00:13:02.540" style="s2">or you can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.680" end="00:13:06.080" style="s2">I remember the Vancouver riots and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.540" end="00:13:07.520" style="s2">people describing how hard it was to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.080" end="00:13:11.390" style="s2">on the periphery because the energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.520" end="00:13:13.490" style="s2">itself moves the patterns of energy in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.390" end="00:13:15.170" style="s2">you and so you can find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.490" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">becoming more violent and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.170" end="00:13:24.050" style="s2">aggressive or more in that that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">experience so so there&#39;s a and why is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.050" end="00:13:27.800" style="s2">that not what&#39;s happening how are you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:31.870" style="s2">queer that that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.800" end="00:13:34.970" style="s2">in these groups well I&#39;m not clear but</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.870" end="00:13:37.130" style="s2">um well there&#39;s a dirt there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.970" end="00:13:40.520" style="s2">derogatory way of talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.130" end="00:13:41.830" style="s2">mass consciousness you&#39;re sort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.520" end="00:13:46.880" style="s2">that they don&#39;t want to be doing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.830" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">right because because well I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.880" end="00:13:53.180" style="s2">this is this is not emergent thing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:57.339" style="s2">mean subtle energy transmission is</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.180" end="00:14:02.300" style="s2">nothing new right and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.339" end="00:14:05.750" style="s2">people that in certain places that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.300" end="00:14:08.750" style="s2">experienced where you know you can you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.750" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">can develop a subtle energy field and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.750" end="00:14:14.839" style="s2">then you can prime that with an object</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">for the conceptual mind so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.839" end="00:14:19.250" style="s2">which you know this is this is your dead</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">one coming in you can feel it you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.250" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">feel your changing you can feel your</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:25.970" style="s2">heart racing you can feel it can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">and you have to say yes and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.970" end="00:14:31.670" style="s2">prime that with an object and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:33.650" style="s2">can align people around the object so</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.670" end="00:14:35.779" style="s2">then those two things get entangled and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.650" end="00:14:37.940" style="s2">then forever people can chase the object</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.779" end="00:14:40.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s easier because they&#39;ll chase</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.940" end="00:14:42.820" style="s2">the object all the way to the bank or</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.279" end="00:14:46.459" style="s2">whatever right so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.820" end="00:14:48.740" style="s2">extraordinary this is and it can be even</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.459" end="00:14:52.370" style="s2">maudlin you know I mean people go to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.740" end="00:14:56.060" style="s2">business sales techniques to learn this</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.370" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">people go to become ll NLP practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.060" end="00:15:00.670" style="s2">to learn how to be better salespeople so</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">now I think it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.670" end="00:15:11.750" style="s2">phenomenon and that could be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:14.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s not what has the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.750" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">being something that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.060" end="00:15:21.200" style="s2">a greater capacity evolutionary capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:23.510" style="s2">or however people they don&#39;t usually use</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.200" end="00:15:26.390" style="s2">that term but we can use that that term</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.510" end="00:15:30.500" style="s2">and it has as many drawbacks at this</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.390" end="00:15:34.750" style="s2">point history as it does in you know at</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.500" end="00:15:40.940" style="s2">usefulness so I think that that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.750" end="00:15:42.770" style="s2">kind of really primitive thing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.940" end="00:15:52.400" style="s2">not saying that that&#39;s not valuable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.770" end="00:15:57.170" style="s2">just not not new so what I was pleased</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.400" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">to see in the last couple of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.170" end="00:16:05.960" style="s2">I have is an awareness that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:11.420" style="s2">looking for some common denominator</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.960" end="00:16:18.170" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to be unique in as unique</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.420" end="00:16:21.830" style="s2">as we can be and in that process there</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.170" end="00:16:23.990" style="s2">is some kind of collective we could call</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.830" end="00:16:26.180" style="s2">it a collective state experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.990" end="00:16:28.790" style="s2">will just use that as a placeholder it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.180" end="00:16:31.280" style="s2">call different things and so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.790" end="00:16:37.940" style="s2">attention to the uniqueness and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.280" end="00:16:41.570" style="s2">give you an example I I teach this thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.940" end="00:16:44.060" style="s2">with horses so I do so I&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.570" end="00:16:49.660" style="s2">that there is a subtle energy aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.060" end="00:16:53.660" style="s2">it but that subtle energy aspect is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.660" end="00:16:56.900" style="s2">when you&#39;re working with horses and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.660" end="00:16:59.630" style="s2">have you go through this process where</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.900" end="00:17:01.100" style="s2">you&#39;re bonded with them and you want and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.630" end="00:17:03.010" style="s2">you can&#39;t see the horse the horse is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.100" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">behind you and you want the horse to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.010" end="00:17:11.840" style="s2">stay with you we may have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:14.300" style="s2">this the other day but and the horses</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.840" end="00:17:17.300" style="s2">behind you if you if you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.300" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">horse behind you the horse will stay</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.300" end="00:17:22.520" style="s2">right there it actually feels stuck back</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:25.950" style="s2">there because you&#39;re actually thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.520" end="00:17:30.420" style="s2">of the horse behind you but if you scan</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.950" end="00:17:32.700" style="s2">your own body for that place where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.420" end="00:17:36.150" style="s2">just want the horse to be with you that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.700" end="00:17:38.550" style="s2">that feeling of wanting to be with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.150" end="00:17:41.220" style="s2">horse or being in relationship doors any</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.550" end="00:17:43.430" style="s2">and if you skin it as it rises in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.220" end="00:17:48.900" style="s2">body the horse will walk along with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.430" end="00:17:52.280" style="s2">because the uniqueness comes the unique</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.900" end="00:17:54.690" style="s2">aspect is is that it comes up as you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.280" end="00:17:57.240" style="s2">whereas in something and these other</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.690" end="00:18:00.440" style="s2">experiences you really feel that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.240" end="00:18:03.960" style="s2">something in the room or some some</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.440" end="00:18:07.320" style="s2">something exterior to you that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.960" end="00:18:09.300" style="s2">arising and to me that&#39;s the baiting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.320" end="00:18:11.310" style="s2">objective thought you know the mind the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.300" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">mind wants to see an object out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.310" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">and so of course it&#39;s a back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">and so the the groups that emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:30.690" style="s2">that the way the transpersonal arises is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.700" end="00:18:35.670" style="s2">in the unique expression that to me is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.690" end="00:18:39.210" style="s2">new quality of this work so that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.670" end="00:18:53.550" style="s2">be one quality that I would I would look</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:55.530" style="s2">for okay so okay so I have had this</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.550" end="00:18:59.070" style="s2">question about whether these one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.530" end="00:19:01.890" style="s2">these experiences are new or not on one</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.070" end="00:19:04.650" style="s2">of the I think it was one of them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.890" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">beyond awakening calls between Terry and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.650" end="00:19:15.300" style="s2">Thomas hooble either Terry or Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:19.770" style="s2">brought up but whoever brought it up the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.300" end="00:19:21.990" style="s2">only one agreed pre shirt brought up</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.770" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">even like soldiers marching in lockstep</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.990" end="00:19:30.020" style="s2">as an example of and then feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:33.020" style="s2">they slip into a kind of group</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.020" end="00:19:33.020" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.059" end="00:19:43.769" style="s2">as an example of this kind of we space</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.320" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">and in the context of Thomas&#39;s worked in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.769" end="00:19:51.029" style="s2">that sense but and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">differentiations are good because at</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.029" end="00:19:57.779" style="s2">least in terms of there may be different</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:20:00.029" style="s2">kinds of experiences but I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.779" end="00:20:02.429" style="s2">that that everyone working in these</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.029" end="00:20:05.789" style="s2">working in the group spaces are making</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.429" end="00:20:08.850" style="s2">distinctions they may want it to be new</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.789" end="00:20:11.309" style="s2">or might want their might so i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.850" end="00:20:13.230" style="s2">sure i&#39;m not i&#39;m not so confident that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.309" end="00:20:15.750" style="s2">it&#39;s brand new or its old or something</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.230" end="00:20:18.870" style="s2">what might be new is ways of getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.750" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">into it ways of paying attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.870" end="00:20:27.090" style="s2">while it&#39;s happening and then speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:30.120" style="s2">speaking speaking to it and speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.090" end="00:20:32.669" style="s2">from it which makes it stronger and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.120" end="00:20:36.809" style="s2">potentially utilizing it for a given</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.669" end="00:20:41.429" style="s2">purpose consciously within a group right</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.809" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">so so the metaphor of soldiers walking</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.429" end="00:20:51.269" style="s2">in step is what I would be against in</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:55.830" style="s2">other words and so why does that matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.269" end="00:20:57.960" style="s2">I think it matters because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.830" end="00:21:00.779" style="s2">something tricky I call tricky about</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.960" end="00:21:03.630" style="s2">post-war humanism and certainly coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.779" end="00:21:06.510" style="s2">out of World War two where people really</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.630" end="00:21:09.870" style="s2">wanted not to be fighting each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.510" end="00:21:12.870" style="s2">anymore especially Europe and although</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.870" end="00:21:14.820" style="s2">Americans the Anglo Americans were came</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.870" end="00:21:17.100" style="s2">out of World War two actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.820" end="00:21:20.580" style="s2">individualistic but in Europe and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.100" end="00:21:22.289" style="s2">whole humanist movement in post-war</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.580" end="00:21:30.659" style="s2">humanist movement is primarily a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.289" end="00:21:34.399" style="s2">continental movement and so so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.659" end="00:21:38.730" style="s2">kind of sentiment this this this this</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.399" end="00:21:41.519" style="s2">shared consciousness movement has arisen</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.730" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">out of that you know we talked about as</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.519" end="00:21:49.250" style="s2">being green and spiral dynamics and in</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:52.050" style="s2">and the thing is that&#39;s nice but</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.250" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">paradoxically it has really it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.050" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">structure of conscious that that best</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:22:05.690" style="s2">plays into neoliberal capitalism because</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.710" end="00:22:09.210" style="s2">because in the graphics I use is this so</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.690" end="00:22:11.220" style="s2">the post-war humanists like to use the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.210" end="00:22:13.680" style="s2">peer-to-peer people like to use this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.220" end="00:22:15.930" style="s2">thing this illustration where you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.680" end="00:22:19.020" style="s2">there&#39;s the big fish eating the little</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:21.690" style="s2">fish right then what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.020" end="00:22:23.970" style="s2">take all the little fish and the little</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.690" end="00:22:26.040" style="s2">fish are aligned so they&#39;re bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.970" end="00:22:30.150" style="s2">the big fish and then they come to eat</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.040" end="00:22:34.470" style="s2">the big fish so I say but there is no</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.150" end="00:22:35.850" style="s2">big fish who&#39;s the big fish capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.470" end="00:22:39.690" style="s2">will whose capital is just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.850" end="00:22:42.060" style="s2">people who are aligned there is no big</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.690" end="00:22:44.730" style="s2">fish the big fish is a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.060" end="00:22:49.290" style="s2">illusion right there&#39;s only little</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.730" end="00:22:53.610" style="s2">fishes right there&#39;s only people so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.290" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">alignment policy is as problematic as it</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.610" end="00:23:03.870" style="s2">has potential and so that&#39;s a false</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:05.310" style="s2">argument and and what&#39;s happened you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.870" end="00:23:08.460" style="s2">know Roy Bosch car talks about</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.310" end="00:23:10.260" style="s2">capitalism is only able to be maintained</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.460" end="00:23:12.870" style="s2">by the creativity of the slaves and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.260" end="00:23:18.330" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think has happened you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.870" end="00:23:22.560" style="s2">know so the biggest the biggest boom to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.330" end="00:23:27.090" style="s2">post-war to neo global capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.560" end="00:23:29.640" style="s2">post-war humanism and you you may or may</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.090" end="00:23:32.130" style="s2">not think that&#39;s problematic but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.640" end="00:23:35.940" style="s2">paradox is most for post-war humanists</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.130" end="00:23:38.520" style="s2">thinks the biggest problem is capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.940" end="00:23:42.290" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s some kind of strange</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.520" end="00:23:51.450" style="s2">Oh be careful what you wish for here oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.290" end="00:23:53.640" style="s2">well um so so if that&#39;s the outcome even</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.450" end="00:23:56.070" style="s2">if it&#39;s not the goal if it&#39;s the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.640" end="00:23:58.170" style="s2">of this work then I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:23:59.640" style="s2">problematic and it certainly would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.170" end="00:24:02.250" style="s2">unfortunate for someone like Terry</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.640" end="00:24:02.669" style="s2">patents work because he truly wants to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.250" end="00:24:05.489" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.669" end="00:24:08.609" style="s2">in two movements that were inspired like</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.489" end="00:24:10.350" style="s2">occupy in two movements that will break</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.609" end="00:24:12.659" style="s2">down the structures of neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.350" end="00:24:15.629" style="s2">capitalism and these other types of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.659" end="00:24:18.090" style="s2">status boundaries so so I think his</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.629" end="00:24:21.049" style="s2">intention is in the right place but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.090" end="00:24:28.340" style="s2">question is whether the outcome he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.049" end="00:24:32.609" style="s2">proposing is actually an effective um</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.340" end="00:24:36.419" style="s2">you know counter terrorist attack there</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.609" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">some look you know um if capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.419" end="00:24:51.269" style="s2">the terrorists here so so for me it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:54.059" style="s2">matters and um and yeah and in fact but</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.269" end="00:24:59.419" style="s2">the three people I know or the three or</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.059" end="00:25:05.100" style="s2">four people i know most well our are</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.419" end="00:25:09.600" style="s2">truly undoubtedly not for neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.100" end="00:25:15.720" style="s2">capitalism or that whole kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.600" end="00:25:23.369" style="s2">so so there&#39;s a so that&#39;s one whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.720" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">arena like I said I&#39;m speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.369" end="00:25:28.679" style="s2">conjecture so there are questions I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:34.549" style="s2">about these kinds of experiences that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.679" end="00:25:34.549" style="s2">don&#39;t really know so for example like</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.859" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">for example with Thomas people&#39;s work he</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">talks about mmm now see I feel I feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:45.509" style="s2">very uncomfortable referencing any of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.220" end="00:25:48.149" style="s2">these people that I have such little</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.509" end="00:25:49.859" style="s2">experience with is leaving him as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.149" end="00:25:53.789" style="s2">placeholder and we&#39;re basically talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.859" end="00:25:55.559" style="s2">about your understanding we could even</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.789" end="00:25:57.480" style="s2">say us our projection we don&#39;t care we</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.559" end="00:26:00.749" style="s2">can you can use yeah my term i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.480" end="00:26:03.239" style="s2">i&#39;m here i&#39;m curious about i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.749" end="00:26:05.519" style="s2">i&#39;m very curious about I think it&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.239" end="00:26:08.669" style="s2">like right now when I enter enter when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.519" end="00:26:10.769" style="s2">enter any space and that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.669" end="00:26:11.970" style="s2">also exciting like there&#39;s something and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.769" end="00:26:15.779" style="s2">that&#39;s why I don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.970" end="00:26:18.539" style="s2">separate it so clearly yet from these</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.779" end="00:26:22.739" style="s2">from mass consciousness experiences like</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.539" end="00:26:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s fun so I what I want to go to up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.739" end="00:26:27.179" style="s2">my head so like okay the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.840" end="00:26:29.700" style="s2">that&#39;s fun to do I think there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.179" end="00:26:33.570" style="s2">it okay i think that there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.700" end="00:26:34.919" style="s2">reasons why collective i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.570" end="00:26:38.399" style="s2">gonna call it collective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.919" end="00:26:41.249" style="s2">as a whole okay generally right now come</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.399" end="00:26:44.070" style="s2">in in the kind of spiritual circles that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.249" end="00:26:45.719" style="s2">i know of and you know more of this all</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.070" end="00:26:47.820" style="s2">these sorts of people doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.719" end="00:26:49.950" style="s2">collective work I think there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:52.469" style="s2">reasons why it&#39;s interesting but one</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.950" end="00:26:54.629" style="s2">basic reason is because it&#39;s fun you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.469" end="00:26:58.349" style="s2">together with a group of people you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.629" end="00:27:00.479" style="s2">to like so and something very cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.349" end="00:27:02.549" style="s2">happens between you and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.479" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">of mystery and I don&#39;t think I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.549" end="00:27:07.169" style="s2">energy is very very central to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:11.759" style="s2">because it feels good it can feel juicy</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.169" end="00:27:13.889" style="s2">I can feel kind of like you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.759" end="00:27:15.719" style="s2">down a pathway and like you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.889" end="00:27:19.489" style="s2">a landscape that you&#39;ve never known</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.719" end="00:27:22.109" style="s2">before you can actually feel like</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.489" end="00:27:24.779" style="s2">synchronicities become very very</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.109" end="00:27:27.599" style="s2">prominent in the space and not just and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.779" end="00:27:29.149" style="s2">it&#39;ll feel like not just like even like</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.599" end="00:27:33.479" style="s2">I&#39;ve had experiences in a group where</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.149" end="00:27:35.219" style="s2">synchronicities don&#39;t just feel in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.479" end="00:27:36.749" style="s2">members of the group but they also feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.219" end="00:27:38.999" style="s2">like they&#39;re happening with the group</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.749" end="00:27:43.169" style="s2">from out from external objects at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.999" end="00:27:45.269" style="s2">same time and communication becomes</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.169" end="00:27:46.739" style="s2">really subtle so it becomes like and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.269" end="00:27:49.429" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention to it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.739" end="00:27:51.830" style="s2">kind of very neat confirmation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.429" end="00:27:57.599" style="s2">psychic communication or sublingual</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.830" end="00:28:00.599" style="s2">communication so and and it feels good</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.599" end="00:28:03.029" style="s2">to be part of a group you know and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.599" end="00:28:06.570" style="s2">seems like in a lot of cases spontaneity</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.029" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">is a big is a big see again I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.570" end="00:28:10.919" style="s2">the methods all that well but I know at</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:12.899" style="s2">least in some cases spontaneity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.919" end="00:28:16.309" style="s2">saying yes to whatever&#39;s coming through</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.899" end="00:28:20.129" style="s2">you is like a big part of the method and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.309" end="00:28:22.679" style="s2">acting spontaneously improv spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.129" end="00:28:25.109" style="s2">speech all of these things kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.679" end="00:28:28.289" style="s2">think pretty sure of heard interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.109" end="00:28:30.090" style="s2">studies about how they they it can</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.289" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">change where language come</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.090" end="00:28:35.100" style="s2">from in your brain so it doesn&#39;t feel so</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.990" style="s2">much like I&#39;m thinking about this sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.100" end="00:28:38.970" style="s2">of thing but and so that just that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.990" end="00:28:40.350" style="s2">experience spontaneity spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.970" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">action and speech in general I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.350" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">feels good so you know plus it feels</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.590" end="00:28:50.929" style="s2">good to be part of a group so all I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:54.840" style="s2">all these questions about basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.929" end="00:28:57.510" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here and then the last</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.840" end="00:28:59.789" style="s2">interesting thing is that it can be it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.510" end="00:29:04.500" style="s2">can be it&#39;s really exciting to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.789" end="00:29:06.840" style="s2">like see how this could be used to solve</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.500" end="00:29:10.770" style="s2">problems basically and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.840" end="00:29:15.809" style="s2">that&#39;s where I&#39;m most that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.770" end="00:29:20.100" style="s2">think the sort of like rubber hits the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.809" end="00:29:22.260" style="s2">road I I think what is right there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:26.190" style="s2">like when you&#39;re in when you&#39;re with</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.260" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">these people are you how what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.190" end="00:29:32.190" style="s2">problems can you solve better and is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">truly that you have access to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.190" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">information and that you wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:42.020" style="s2">had access to as individuals even</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:45.899" style="s2">individuals working wonderfully together</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.020" end="00:29:47.700" style="s2">and because otherwise it&#39;s I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.899" end="00:29:49.049" style="s2">experiences are wonderful and they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.700" end="00:29:51.539" style="s2">teach us about ourselves and about</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.049" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">groups and about energies and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.539" end="00:29:55.770" style="s2">of things but but and they&#39;re fun so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:57.510" style="s2">not counting them but like if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.770" end="00:30:00.210" style="s2">really if it really is something new</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.510" end="00:30:04.529" style="s2">happening something you know like kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.210" end="00:30:06.539" style="s2">of like like like paradigm shifting or</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.529" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">something like that then it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.539" end="00:30:10.890" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be like yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:13.460" style="s2">actually new information involvement or</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.890" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">new problems that are solved better</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.460" end="00:30:19.830" style="s2">Magnus and and I haven&#39;t heard anyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:25.110" style="s2">flat out say yes we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.830" end="00:30:28.470" style="s2">like that in a really clear way yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.110" end="00:30:31.049" style="s2">a really impressive way also okay hold</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.470" end="00:30:33.809" style="s2">on edit breaks you could that storm is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.049" end="00:30:35.640" style="s2">coming so it&#39;s very dark outside that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.809" end="00:30:37.950" style="s2">awesome I&#39;m you sound like you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.640" end="00:30:39.270" style="s2">great weather there I know did you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.950" end="00:30:40.920" style="s2">how bright it was when I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.270" end="00:30:44.160" style="s2">started and now it&#39;s like it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.920" end="00:30:46.140" style="s2">change so fast summer east coast weather</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.160" end="00:30:48.540" style="s2">that&#39;s so cool I miss it well cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.140" end="00:30:52.980" style="s2">the transition you know there&#39;s not half</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.540" end="00:30:56.070" style="s2">hours later ok so now you see so I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.980" end="00:31:04.740" style="s2">the dour person but this exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:31:06.360" style="s2">my my natural sense of this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.740" end="00:31:09.240" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying what you&#39;re saying I</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.360" end="00:31:13.500" style="s2">was writing copy for the campaign and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.240" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">wrote something about insight or</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.500" end="00:31:18.120" style="s2">collective insight you know it&#39;s natural</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:20.550" style="s2">it&#39;s spontaneous it&#39;s play its</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.120" end="00:31:25.080" style="s2">imaginative these are the words that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.550" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">would use for this work you know it it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.080" end="00:31:36.750" style="s2">um it&#39;s embodied it&#39;s I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">collective version of you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.750" end="00:31:43.620" style="s2">we call flow in sports or flow in I</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.700" end="00:31:47.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to say his name but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.620" end="00:31:49.650" style="s2">person who created that concept and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.400" end="00:31:54.210" style="s2">uses the same same words you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.650" end="00:31:56.430" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.210" end="00:31:58.290" style="s2">spontaneity in it I like to think of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.430" end="00:32:03.180" style="s2">it can get at the level where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.290" end="00:32:06.450" style="s2">high play you know like like the even</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.180" end="00:32:09.780" style="s2">the conceptual aspects are really moving</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.450" end="00:32:15.470" style="s2">in territories that they really haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.780" end="00:32:17.670" style="s2">been before but because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.470" end="00:32:20.540" style="s2">intersubjective resonance that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.670" end="00:32:23.700" style="s2">following concepts into new territory</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.540" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">without a lot of experience behind them</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.700" end="00:32:30.870" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to have gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.610" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">whole lot of time with someone and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.870" end="00:32:38.370" style="s2">can start tracking each other in this in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:43.620" style="s2">this other way but I would not call that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.370" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">I you know it says doesn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.620" end="00:32:52.210" style="s2">much to do with what is traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:54.490" style="s2">called awakening or anything I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.210" end="00:32:56.710" style="s2">it reminds me more of you know those</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.490" end="00:32:59.520" style="s2">videos will you see the two kids</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.710" end="00:33:01.720" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re twins and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.520" end="00:33:04.300" style="s2">dancing and they&#39;re talking and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.720" end="00:33:07.900" style="s2">taught their their their words don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.300" end="00:33:10.540" style="s2">have any concrete signifiers right but</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.900" end="00:33:15.700" style="s2">they&#39;re tracking each other because they</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.540" end="00:33:22.740" style="s2">are together in this other kind of field</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.700" end="00:33:28.060" style="s2">right and so so so for me these are</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.740" end="00:33:30.610" style="s2">natural primitives you know of human</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.060" end="00:33:33.880" style="s2">nature and if we can stay in that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.610" end="00:33:36.730" style="s2">then add the conceptual blending then</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.880" end="00:33:39.070" style="s2">maybe the concepts can create the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.730" end="00:33:42.160" style="s2">insights and the concepts you know but</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.070" end="00:33:46.750" style="s2">but but to me that&#39;s more like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.160" end="00:33:49.870" style="s2">covering something originally and a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.750" end="00:33:53.890" style="s2">of a process of subtracting then some</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.870" end="00:33:56.140" style="s2">kind of new evolutionary territory so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.890" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">would say bring you know you know so</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.140" end="00:34:01.060" style="s2">that that is another way that I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:04.870" style="s2">comfortable with the saying that that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.060" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">exactly what on rare occasion we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.870" end="00:34:12.510" style="s2">experience and those of us who know how</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:17.500" style="s2">to play with people get to experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.510" end="00:34:19.380" style="s2">that more often and so what has to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.500" end="00:34:21.940" style="s2">subtracted a lot of things and not</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.380" end="00:34:24.820" style="s2">normally have to be subtracted in a work</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.940" end="00:34:26.740" style="s2">situation all the power structures have</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.820" end="00:34:30.220" style="s2">to be subtracted you never get to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.740" end="00:34:32.200" style="s2">point of play right so in income there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.220" end="00:34:34.660" style="s2">a lot of conventional situations where</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.200" end="00:34:39.340" style="s2">teams can&#39;t really get to that point of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.660" end="00:34:43.650" style="s2">play because of these structures or you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.340" end="00:34:48.550" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.650" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">obstacles that disabled people from</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.550" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">being spontaneous creative and playful</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:07.890" style="s2">so you know Harry that&#39;s all there is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.750" end="00:35:14.250" style="s2">it ya know I don&#39;t know I and I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.890" end="00:35:16.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s like an awesome explain I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.250" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">guess yeah you know why why am I why do</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.890" end="00:35:21.960" style="s2">I feel skeptical I feel skeptical and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">because in some ways it feels like a fad</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.960" end="00:35:29.670" style="s2">and I don&#39;t really I&#39;m not often on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:32.700" style="s2">forefront of fads and so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.670" end="00:35:40.650" style="s2">resentful what all the cool people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.700" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">doing yeah so like you go do it and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.650" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">bring it you tell me but yeah I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">could be like it could be a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:52.770" style="s2">way of being a committed a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:54.780" style="s2">thing I mean one thing I&#39;m yeah okay so</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.770" end="00:35:57.960" style="s2">one thing is like you know Tom&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.780" end="00:36:00.510" style="s2">talk to us about but I just don&#39;t I&#39;m i</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.960" end="00:36:04.950" style="s2">have i have confusions about yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.510" end="00:36:07.430" style="s2">so like Thomas whoville talks about not</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.950" end="00:36:10.140" style="s2">knowing he talks about speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.430" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">like a murder I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.140" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">speaking from emergence but basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:17.190" style="s2">not sure not knowing what you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:19.109" style="s2">to say next okay and you know it just</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.190" end="00:36:21.720" style="s2">feels better it just feels</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.109" end="00:36:23.190" style="s2">better to interact with people from that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.720" end="00:36:25.260" style="s2">place even when you&#39;re just having a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.190" end="00:36:27.810" style="s2">conversation with a friend like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.260" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">in that place or more in that place than</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.810" end="00:36:33.320" style="s2">trying to you know repeat old thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:36.570" style="s2">that I&#39;ve had or something like that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.320" end="00:36:40.859" style="s2">am it&#39;s just more fun it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.570" end="00:36:43.470" style="s2">spontaneous it&#39;s it&#39;s more fun um and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.859" end="00:36:45.660" style="s2">contrast that so like if we were to just</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.470" end="00:36:47.310" style="s2">sit together and be like neither knows</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.660" end="00:36:49.380" style="s2">where we&#39;re gonna go at all we have no</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.310" end="00:36:52.349" style="s2">topics in mind we&#39;re just gonna we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.380" end="00:36:55.320" style="s2">just gonna just be here and speak and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.349" end="00:36:59.339" style="s2">see what happens on the total other side</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.320" end="00:37:02.630" style="s2">of the spectrum I I point to like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.339" end="00:37:05.070" style="s2">of what my schooling has been like where</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.630" end="00:37:07.109" style="s2">the teachers standing in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.070" end="00:37:09.319" style="s2">room and there&#39;s a bunch of students</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.109" end="00:37:12.499" style="s2">over here and he knows exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.319" end="00:37:14.479" style="s2">gonna say and when he or EP goes to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.499" end="00:37:16.219" style="s2">conference he knows exactly what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.479" end="00:37:19.069" style="s2">going to say he&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.219" end="00:37:22.759" style="s2">information delivery right and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.069" end="00:37:27.650" style="s2">and so it&#39;s dead it totally dead and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.759" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">that&#39;s why i hated school even college I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.650" end="00:37:34.009" style="s2">mean that&#39;s not you know so so but I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.910" end="00:37:36.019" style="s2">have a question about and and so it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.009" end="00:37:38.569" style="s2">feels like from the spontaneous place</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.019" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">that new things are happening and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.569" end="00:37:42.410" style="s2">not that concepts don&#39;t get weaved in</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:45.499" style="s2">because they&#39;re I&#39;ve learned them</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.410" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">they&#39;re part of who I am but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.499" end="00:37:49.219" style="s2">have known those concepts this is my</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:50.869" style="s2">hypothesis at the moment I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.219" end="00:37:52.759" style="s2">would have known those concepts unless i</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.869" end="00:37:54.380" style="s2">received them in an intact way it from</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.759" end="00:37:57.469" style="s2">someone else i read them in a book or</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.380" end="00:38:00.829" style="s2">something so I get a little concerned</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.469" end="00:38:02.299" style="s2">about you know thinking that these</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.829" end="00:38:03.890" style="s2">collective consciousness or things are</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.299" end="00:38:08.749" style="s2">going to take are going to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.890" end="00:38:12.339" style="s2">huge new thing in a way that we diminish</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.749" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">the value of these not as fun but</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.339" end="00:38:17.420" style="s2">potentially use but useful clearly other</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.869" style="s2">ways of communicating in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">just delivering information for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.869" end="00:38:25.579" style="s2">or collecting information or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:27.380" style="s2">you know so so then you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.579" end="00:38:29.869" style="s2">another that&#39;s just another question I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.380" end="00:38:32.390" style="s2">have and it&#39;s boring like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.869" end="00:38:34.699" style="s2">kind of like this then like I feel sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.390" end="00:38:38.719" style="s2">of like this boring moderate when I say</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.699" end="00:38:40.459" style="s2">something like that but like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.719" end="00:38:43.910" style="s2">kind of like common sense kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.459" end="00:38:46.670" style="s2">but like it&#39;s true it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.910" end="00:38:48.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a utility there are utilities to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.670" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">these different ways of communicating</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.049" end="00:38:55.190" style="s2">and I think we&#39;re you know on we should</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:57.319" style="s2">honor the utility of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:39:01.579" style="s2">all kinds of ways of communicating if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.319" end="00:39:03.049" style="s2">indeed find that we need that so and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.579" end="00:39:05.420" style="s2">end and there&#39;s more there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.049" end="00:39:09.969" style="s2">there&#39;s more like a hyper emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.420" end="00:39:14.920" style="s2">the new you know kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.969" end="00:39:18.259" style="s2">generational disinterest in history</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.920" end="00:39:20.650" style="s2">lineage past knowledge I think are bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.259" end="00:39:20.650" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.670" end="00:39:30.780" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s a lot of themes here</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.450" end="00:39:35.450" style="s2">I think the better at play that make me</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.780" end="00:39:37.500" style="s2">both excited and slightly hesitant about</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.450" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">that all of this collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.500" end="00:39:42.930" style="s2">consciousness work yeah I mean I think a</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:45.030" style="s2">nice attitude is is to be experimental</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.930" end="00:39:48.920" style="s2">like you said you know if your</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.030" end="00:39:56.099" style="s2">experimental it&#39;s always interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.920" end="00:40:00.180" style="s2">and it can often be fun but so so let me</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.099" end="00:40:07.710" style="s2">try to make the case for what could</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.180" end="00:40:10.020" style="s2">conceivably be useful about it okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.710" end="00:40:12.660" style="s2">was talking to someone the other day and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">I use this metaphor and I and I said we</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.660" end="00:40:17.160" style="s2">when people usually get together as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:19.230" style="s2">group and we&#39;re not talking about people</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.160" end="00:40:21.089" style="s2">get together to only do group</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.230" end="00:40:23.700" style="s2">consciousness work we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.089" end="00:40:32.329" style="s2">people who come together to do things</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.700" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">like work out the terms for Syria to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.329" end="00:40:43.950" style="s2">turn over their chemicals or people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:46.890" style="s2">come together to stop the bleeding of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.950" end="00:40:50.970" style="s2">some kind of financial problem in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.890" end="00:40:54.329" style="s2">large corporate you know now wicked</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.970" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">problems so you get groups come together</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.329" end="00:41:16.890" style="s2">and um the initial phase is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:19.369" style="s2">ruled by implicit rules somewhat um then</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.890" end="00:41:22.349" style="s2">in what what usually happens is people</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.369" end="00:41:24.510" style="s2">or this group that I&#39;m working with let</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.349" end="00:41:25.980" style="s2">me just this will make it more easy to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.510" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">describe I&#39;ll just described the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.980" end="00:41:31.260" style="s2">dynamics in this group so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.880" style="s2">diversity of opinions about building</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.260" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.880" end="00:41:40.519" style="s2">network for building trust at a distance</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:43.970" style="s2">and there&#39;s a pretty strong fault line</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.519" end="00:41:46.220" style="s2">between one person which more pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.970" end="00:41:50.680" style="s2">and object-oriented and one person who</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.220" end="00:41:54.140" style="s2">thinks that we have to get the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.680" end="00:41:57.259" style="s2">intellectual design of it right first a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:42:00.130" style="s2">pragmatic person here and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.259" end="00:42:03.289" style="s2">person who&#39;s more of a meta thinker now</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.130" end="00:42:06.650" style="s2">from where I look at they&#39;re both going</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.289" end="00:42:10.549" style="s2">to build the same thing but the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.650" end="00:42:13.910" style="s2">get such that there&#39;s a fault line and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.549" end="00:42:16.190" style="s2">then the group involved are are either</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.910" end="00:42:19.250" style="s2">you know so then they start adding</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.190" end="00:42:21.890" style="s2">people to their team and consciously or</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.250" end="00:42:24.740" style="s2">unconsciously it teeters and tatars some</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.890" end="00:42:27.710" style="s2">more people get added that on this fault</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.740" end="00:42:30.650" style="s2">line is and so some people get in so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.710" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">have this polarization thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.650" end="00:42:37.180" style="s2">going to happen that won&#39;t go away which</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:39.380" style="s2">will destroy their ability to make a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:43.460" style="s2">system that they want to build it will</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.380" end="00:42:45.769" style="s2">please have that fault one so when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.460" end="00:42:48.680" style="s2">try to talk to people about it what</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.769" end="00:42:51.170" style="s2">happens is they just keep downloading</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.680" end="00:42:53.720" style="s2">their information in various ways they</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.170" end="00:42:57.289" style="s2">just try to argue their point the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.720" end="00:43:01.819" style="s2">way over and over and over again and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.289" end="00:43:03.829" style="s2">they don&#39;t make any progress so I so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.819" end="00:43:06.859" style="s2">metaphor I use is I like look guys you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.829" end="00:43:09.259" style="s2">know you wouldn&#39;t go to a barbecue let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.859" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">say everybody came to a group BBQ and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.259" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">y&#39;all brought your own piece of me so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:17.089" style="s2">you brought chicken and you brought ribs</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:21.109" style="s2">said you wouldn&#39;t expect to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.089" end="00:43:24.529" style="s2">barbecue with Uncle chickens and ribs</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.109" end="00:43:26.869" style="s2">you&#39;d expect to cook it into something</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.529" end="00:43:29.869" style="s2">else you know and so the when you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.869" end="00:43:32.450" style="s2">people who trust each other but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.869" end="00:43:35.240" style="s2">a fault line then the only way to move</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.450" end="00:43:37.039" style="s2">is not this one moved to this person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.240" end="00:43:40.309" style="s2">or this you have to create something</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.039" end="00:43:44.869" style="s2">that you never thought of before to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.309" end="00:43:48.829" style="s2">that&#39;s the exciting part like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.869" end="00:43:57.799" style="s2">the exciting part is that this has gone</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.829" end="00:44:00.349" style="s2">on so long that that we know that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.799" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">real place we want to be is neither</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.349" end="00:44:04.130" style="s2">place I mean you both just dump</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:07.009" style="s2">everything you know to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.130" end="00:44:11.869" style="s2">unknowing maybe that you was talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.009" end="00:44:13.970" style="s2">about because we&#39;re not making any</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.869" end="00:44:15.950" style="s2">movement maybe it&#39;s not even progress</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.970" end="00:44:18.710" style="s2">maybe at this point even going backwards</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.950" end="00:44:21.019" style="s2">is better than not making any movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.710" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">and so with that in mind that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.019" end="00:44:26.509" style="s2">would call collective inciting so now</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve all agreed you put it all on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.509" end="00:44:31.549" style="s2">table and what you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:34.190" style="s2">everything that everyone can see you</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.549" end="00:44:37.430" style="s2">agree is not what you want to see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.190" end="00:44:43.640" style="s2">not the point it&#39;s dead it&#39;s known it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.430" end="00:44:46.339" style="s2">done with now what cook up right oh no</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.640" end="00:44:49.730" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t exist and so to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.339" end="00:44:55.640" style="s2">very fun and very playful and when that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.730" end="00:44:59.450" style="s2">process happens there is a chance and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.640" end="00:45:01.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen often that people you</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.450" end="00:45:03.079" style="s2">have to get creative and crazy and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.369" end="00:45:04.460" style="s2">come up with different ideas you talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.079" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">about things that aren&#39;t possible then</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.460" end="00:45:09.230" style="s2">all of a sudden some idea wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:12.109" style="s2">do you mean this and maybe it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.230" end="00:45:14.809" style="s2">what you meant but that person actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.109" end="00:45:17.450" style="s2">set it in a way you wish to I said it</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.809" end="00:45:20.420" style="s2">and then all of a sudden you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.450" end="00:45:24.170" style="s2">who said what first and you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.420" end="00:45:26.509" style="s2">credit any one person and a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.170" end="00:45:29.569" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of joy and you laugh but</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.509" end="00:45:32.239" style="s2">but something that really nobody to talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.569" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">about before never really thought of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.239" end="00:45:37.849" style="s2">that way before gets generated in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:40.579" style="s2">process and then I would call that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.849" end="00:45:45.859" style="s2">collective inciting and I think it only</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.579" end="00:45:48.200" style="s2">requires an orientation around really</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.859" end="00:45:50.690" style="s2">understanding that what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.200" end="00:45:53.809" style="s2">you question and what you fear you all</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.690" end="00:45:55.279" style="s2">look at it you all look at what all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.809" end="00:45:58.360" style="s2">its brought to the table and then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.279" end="00:46:01.660" style="s2">agree what we want to leave with is</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.360" end="00:46:04.750" style="s2">none of that look that&#39;s it you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.660" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">out of here that&#39;s boring that&#39;s dead I</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.750" end="00:46:09.430" style="s2">get back to the office I might use it</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:13.540" style="s2">but for this experience get that out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.430" end="00:46:18.340" style="s2">here it&#39;s no fun mm-hmm so the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.540" end="00:46:19.960" style="s2">difference I see between that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.340" end="00:46:22.780" style="s2">work when you&#39;re describing or it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.960" end="00:46:25.060" style="s2">like you are facilitating that with</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.780" end="00:46:26.890" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t familiar with it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.060" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">these other what these other groups are</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.890" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">doing some of them at least is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:36.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a tension being placed on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">field itself on the field or on what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.340" end="00:46:43.000" style="s2">group is doing itself with an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:45.310" style="s2">that this kind of field or space again</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.000" end="00:46:47.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have the right terms can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.310" end="00:46:50.110" style="s2">created and is useful so that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.380" end="00:46:52.990" style="s2">modulate how you&#39;re being with each</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.110" end="00:46:56.470" style="s2">other moment to moment and how you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.990" end="00:46:59.140" style="s2">order to and have attention on the space</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.470" end="00:47:02.890" style="s2">itself in order to keep growing the to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.140" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">keep growing the space which adds an</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.890" end="00:47:07.480" style="s2">extra level of excitement to it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:09.970" style="s2">sense of potential I mean what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.480" end="00:47:15.460" style="s2">doing I think what they&#39;re doing is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.970" end="00:47:17.590" style="s2">like really it&#39;s more like experimental</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.460" end="00:47:20.350" style="s2">or theoretical physics you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.590" end="00:47:24.070" style="s2">really looking at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.350" end="00:47:26.910" style="s2">components of what are the qualities</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.070" end="00:47:30.060" style="s2">textures tastes components structures</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.910" end="00:47:32.710" style="s2">obstacles when people get together and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.060" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">so for my symposium I&#39;d like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.710" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">like so now what are just some</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:41.590" style="s2">principles that we can use to you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:45.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t want it you don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.590" end="00:47:47.080" style="s2">it as a methodology want to prime the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.040" end="00:47:53.740" style="s2">notion of collective consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.080" end="00:47:55.870" style="s2">anything right we want to or I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.740" end="00:47:57.460" style="s2">when I use the term collective inciting</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.870" end="00:48:03.670" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying this is what other people</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.460" end="00:48:10.990" style="s2">are interested in but and it may or may</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.670" end="00:48:13.390" style="s2">not lead to more or less a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.990" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">collective consciousness I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.390" end="00:48:18.910" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure you know I&#39;ve never tried</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:24.970" style="s2">it with I&#39;ve never been successful yet</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.910" end="00:48:27.880" style="s2">with a naive teen because they usually</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.970" end="00:48:29.950" style="s2">just even still argue that that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.880" end="00:48:32.920" style="s2">way Ellen clueless that online course</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.950" end="00:48:36.360" style="s2">there have been there&#39;s been quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.920" end="00:48:42.780" style="s2">of movement toward that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.360" end="00:48:42.780" style="s2">discourse that&#39;s more more generative</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:54.850" style="s2">and I think the sense of losing track of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:49:00.580" style="s2">who&#39;s who said what first or who had</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.850" end="00:49:03.010" style="s2">that idea or how the idea came I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.580" end="00:49:07.140" style="s2">that&#39;s part of that that extent that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.010" end="00:49:07.140" style="s2">feeling you know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.130" end="00:49:13.450" style="s2">yeah so so in a classroom situation we</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.380" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">have a real teacher it feels like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.450" end="00:49:18.100" style="s2">you know you&#39;re talking to the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:20.140" style="s2">and and knowledge is being generated but</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.100" end="00:49:24.750" style="s2">you stopped to lose track of who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.140" end="00:49:28.410" style="s2">teaching home it&#39;s just kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.750" end="00:49:28.410" style="s2">Little Lulu</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.079" end="00:49:40.109" style="s2">when I</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.570" end="00:50:05.890" style="s2">it feels you know what it feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.160" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">feels like when i first started</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.890" end="00:50:16.060" style="s2">meditating the very first experience i</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">had of meditating i I this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.060" end="00:50:18.940" style="s2">the excite this is the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:21.430" style="s2">excitement and potential and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.940" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">mean this is my hesitancy with the group</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.430" end="00:50:27.220" style="s2">conscience thing it could be really and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:29.500" style="s2">I know when I want to support the this</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.220" end="00:50:30.730" style="s2">experimentation but I don&#39;t think just</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.500" end="00:50:33.790" style="s2">the I don&#39;t think the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.730" end="00:50:35.860" style="s2">excitement and potential guarantees</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.790" end="00:50:40.420" style="s2">anything I think it just makes it worth</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.860" end="00:50:43.450" style="s2">it because like when i first started i</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.420" end="00:50:45.550" style="s2">also had yeah okay at first when i first</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.450" end="00:50:47.320" style="s2">started meditating i had the experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.550" end="00:50:49.270" style="s2">of dropping into this whole inner</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.320" end="00:50:53.350" style="s2">landscape that i didn&#39;t know was there</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.270" end="00:50:57.670" style="s2">and it was all i had was textures and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.350" end="00:51:04.570" style="s2">shapes and it was beautiful it was it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.670" end="00:51:08.530" style="s2">was beautiful but and eventually the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.570" end="00:51:15.010" style="s2">novelty of exploring new textures and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.530" end="00:51:19.240" style="s2">shapes itself more off and so that kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.010" end="00:51:21.970" style="s2">of excitement and potential was no</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.240" end="00:51:23.590" style="s2">longer was no longer there really and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.970" end="00:51:25.150" style="s2">then this there is more of a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.590" end="00:51:27.940" style="s2">like okay well it&#39;s time to get down to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.150" end="00:51:31.240" style="s2">work basically it&#39;s time to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.940" end="00:51:34.890" style="s2">common sense again and eventually you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.240" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">know shadow work and integration and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.890" end="00:51:47.140" style="s2">awakening in the context of the ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:52.870" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s neat it&#39;s neat but but</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.140" end="00:51:55.180" style="s2">I&#39;m not I have no I have no no feeling</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.870" end="00:51:57.610" style="s2">of you know like oh this is the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.180" end="00:52:00.490" style="s2">solution to all of our problems I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.610" end="00:52:02.860" style="s2">skeptical of any anytime somebody sets</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.490" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">this is the big solution to all of our</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.860" end="00:52:09.460" style="s2">problems because because i often find</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:12.100" style="s2">the most authentic virtues my experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.460" end="00:52:14.070" style="s2">of the most authentic virtues are that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.100" end="00:52:16.890" style="s2">they feel ground</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.070" end="00:52:22.790" style="s2">it like they feel like they come from a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.890" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">deep place of alcohol deep common sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.790" end="00:52:27.180" style="s2">those are the people who I really see</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:29.850" style="s2">like paying attention to the details of</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.180" end="00:52:31.980" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the world and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.850" end="00:52:34.010" style="s2">doing the day-to-day work doing the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.980" end="00:52:36.810" style="s2">day-to-day work to make change happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.010" end="00:52:39.720" style="s2">and those are the people that make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.810" end="00:52:41.370" style="s2">possible for visionaries of all sorts to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.720" end="00:52:44.190" style="s2">do experimental work in all directions</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.370" end="00:52:47.010" style="s2">and develop new tools for us as a human</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.190" end="00:52:49.020" style="s2">race but then it seems to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.010" end="00:52:55.320" style="s2">utilizing those tools in a way that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.020" end="00:53:01.230" style="s2">just like yeah step kind of like very</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.320" end="00:53:09.210" style="s2">simple very simple unpretentious um you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.230" end="00:53:13.470" style="s2">know grab did yeah I think that that for</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.210" end="00:53:17.070" style="s2">me it&#39;s more like the subtractive path</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.470" end="00:53:19.830" style="s2">right so you have to so if i subtract</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.070" end="00:53:23.070" style="s2">the boundary between me my role as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.830" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">teacher and your role as a student then</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.070" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">we haven&#39;t invented anything new we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:37.020" style="s2">just subtracted something you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:49.590" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know it&#39;s a metaphor but</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.020" end="00:53:51.870" style="s2">I think that we&#39;re always doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.590" end="00:53:58.350" style="s2">funny things as humans you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.870" end="00:53:59.820" style="s2">always creating prisons we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.350" end="00:54:01.800" style="s2">with this last time and then forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.820" end="00:54:04.080" style="s2">we created them and then we bust out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.800" end="00:54:07.830" style="s2">them will get so proud of ourselves you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.080" end="00:54:09.810" style="s2">know so like we create the ego and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.830" end="00:54:13.020" style="s2">we spend two thousand years creating</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.810" end="00:54:14.550" style="s2">practices that can deconstruct the ego</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.020" end="00:54:17.460" style="s2">and then we get really proud of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.550" end="00:54:19.800" style="s2">ourselves right foot but so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.460" end="00:54:22.190" style="s2">tendency that might happen with this</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.800" end="00:54:25.800" style="s2">collective version of is we create this</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.190" end="00:54:26.820" style="s2">structure called the wii space and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.800" end="00:54:29.700" style="s2">it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.820" end="00:54:32.100" style="s2">like completely now that we got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.700" end="00:54:33.570" style="s2">the ego we can create this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.100" end="00:54:36.300" style="s2">the wii space that we all can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.570" end="00:54:39.930" style="s2">underneath which is really exciting and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.300" end="00:54:42.300" style="s2">then in the next phase we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.930" end="00:54:45.590" style="s2">deconstruct it and deliberate it again</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.300" end="00:54:50.100" style="s2">into our individual selfness and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.590" end="00:54:51.960" style="s2">uniqueness right so I think that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.100" end="00:54:54.930" style="s2">fine if it&#39;s completely transparent</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.960" end="00:55:00.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s just creative it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.930" end="00:55:03.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not transparent that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.770" end="00:55:17.400" style="s2">painful I would say I mean other than</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.630" end="00:55:19.410" style="s2">that you know so so like yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.400" end="00:55:22.260" style="s2">that that this is and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.410" end="00:55:26.690" style="s2">thing is i agree with you i think many</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.260" end="00:55:26.690" style="s2">of the things that we think are new new</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.320" end="00:55:35.100" style="s2">newly arising phenomenon because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.450" end="00:55:38.780" style="s2">humans are actually structures or or</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.100" end="00:55:42.690" style="s2">types of phenomenon that we inherit from</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.780" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">you know more of our animal nature more</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.690" end="00:55:52.560" style="s2">of just being a living adapting organism</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:57.860" style="s2">more of some more grounded or deeper</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.560" end="00:56:01.470" style="s2">levels and and if you start to think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.860" end="00:56:02.700" style="s2">experiences as striated like that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.470" end="00:56:05.580" style="s2">quote you know would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.700" end="00:56:11.880" style="s2">question as to than what is uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.580" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">human because i agree with you i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.880" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">that the the groundedness that&#39;s enter</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:27.030" style="s2">the subtle energy that we&#39;re all on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:29.370" style="s2">same kind of subtle energy flow you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.030" end="00:56:33.180" style="s2">feel that while porous to it and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.370" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">that we have we share with you know all</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.180" end="00:56:38.250" style="s2">the other sentient beings so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:39.650" style="s2">uniquely human and in that sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.250" end="00:56:43.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not new</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.650" end="00:56:58.230" style="s2">mm-hmm mom but it&#39;s rich in it you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.350" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">so um i&#39;d like to tell a story about hey</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.890" end="00:57:13.250" style="s2">I did oh you did did see that was a big</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.740" end="00:57:16.200" style="s2">story for me when we were growing up</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.250" end="00:57:23.300" style="s2">because when we were going up in typical</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.200" end="00:57:25.620" style="s2">you know American suburbs or rural is</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.300" end="00:57:27.720" style="s2">then I went to Catholic school we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.620" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">feel that individual you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.720" end="00:57:33.390" style="s2">kids of the 50s we felt like things were</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">kind of the same you know Cirie Jonathan</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:42.600" style="s2">I&#39;m unique I&#39;m like an individual right</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.830" end="00:57:45.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s like it&#39;s a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.600" end="00:57:50.520" style="s2">experience so now generations later we</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.600" end="00:57:52.790" style="s2">have people going like raw one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.520" end="00:57:56.100" style="s2">a spiritual experience because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.790" end="00:58:00.090" style="s2">orden it&#39;s not the usual it&#39;s more rare</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.100" end="00:58:02.820" style="s2">right it&#39;s the same it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.090" end="00:58:05.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just that all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.820" end="00:58:09.270" style="s2">realize the other side of the coin and</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.160" end="00:58:14.550" style="s2">it and you&#39;re like whoa whoa one you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.270" end="00:58:17.730" style="s2">know so and that&#39;s so that&#39;s why for me</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.550" end="00:58:20.460" style="s2">it&#39;s this like what&#39;s new what I like to</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.730" end="00:58:22.830" style="s2">play with is being outside of those flip</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.460" end="00:58:25.050" style="s2">flop things for the rest of our human</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.830" end="00:58:29.730" style="s2">existence getting beyond the duality of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.050" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">how we organize experience as one or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.730" end="00:58:36.090" style="s2">other you know so the we thing has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:38.200" style="s2">little bit of that potential trap you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.090" end="00:58:43.890" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.200" end="00:58:50.650" style="s2">and and yet it&#39;s still inviting oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.890" end="00:59:00.190" style="s2">maybe because it&#39;s a potential shot we</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.650" end="00:59:03.490" style="s2">gotta figure that one out too so now</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.190" end="00:59:06.130" style="s2">maybe if people see this last part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.490" end="00:59:10.200" style="s2">the talk maybe they&#39;ll be shall i come</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.130" end="00:59:10.200" style="s2">to be inside in the treat I&#39;m not sure</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.770" end="00:59:28.599" style="s2">more for the new consciousness movement</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.950" end="00:59:33.450" style="s2">and then we could have had more of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.599" end="00:59:33.450" style="s2">fight but uh didn&#39;t happen that way</p>
