<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.520" style="s2">all right this is the first video in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.010" end="00:00:08.309" style="s2">Sicilian series and I guess by nature is</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:09.870" style="s2">gonna be a little bit broader than is</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">appropriate for this particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.870" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">venue I have to prime pad at least a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">little bit of context is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">hopefully in the future we&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">be able to go back and recreate this</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">particular video to be more I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">specific so context the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:29.369" style="s2">city and project is based upon a I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:33.140" style="s2">a premise and a possibility so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.369" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">premise is that the the city is</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.140" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">foundational to the nature of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:41.070" style="s2">called game a or to the the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">basis of the toolkit that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.070" end="00:00:44.700" style="s2">the kinds of civilizations the human</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">beings of this far been able to create</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.700" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">so I&#39;m making a proposition that city is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">more fundamental than civilization the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">possibility that I am proposing is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">we are now within a threshold we are now</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">near to a point we can in fact innovate</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">a new way living together that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">different as a different basis than the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">city and there for and thereby that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:15.030" style="s2">transition is fundamental it moves us</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">from one basis that gives rise to entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.030" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">architecture of civilizations to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">potentially a very different one which</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:22.590" style="s2">if we wanted to use that language we</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">could say game Bay although I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.590" end="00:01:28.680" style="s2">ambivalent about that these days so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">nobody get into the into the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.680" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">this particular piece this piece is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">about about the first proposition and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:38.070" style="s2">some of the context around that and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">do that I have to go into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.070" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">of depth so this video is probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">be on the order of like 10 or 12 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">I apologize for the length the the core</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">theory here comes from work that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">done largely around the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">Institute largely with people like</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">Geoffrey West and we spent court and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">many others and you can read about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">actually in the book called scale the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">differed West produced the past couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">of years and I&#39;ll just give the a brief</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">summary kind of compress the piece that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">I think is most relevant what they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">looking at was particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">characteristics that are called</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">scaling loss which is to say if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">increase some particular characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.300" style="s2">like let&#39;s say for example I have a one</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:20.850" style="s2">brick and that brick weighs one pound</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">and I increase one characteristic so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.850" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">increase from one brick to ten bricks so</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:26.850" style="s2">this gives an increasing number how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:28.740" style="s2">pounds do I have well in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.850" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">bricks it&#39;s a linear scaling loss if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.740" end="00:02:31.850" style="s2">have gone from one brick to ten bricks</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve gone from one pound to ten pound</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.850" end="00:02:36.420" style="s2">and they were looking at various all</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:37.710" style="s2">kinds of different systems in nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.420" end="00:02:39.000" style="s2">looking at what kinds of scaling laws</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.710" end="00:02:41.460" style="s2">were there what they found was that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">there was a very profound fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.460" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">that in many important characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">like for example the ratio between body</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">mass and metabolism or body mass and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">like the amount of vascular tissue like</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">how long was your vascular system if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:01.350" style="s2">kind of could lay it all out and measure</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:04.440" style="s2">it that there was a an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.350" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">regularity of what are called sub linear</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.440" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">scaling laws and very specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">fact 25 which is to say for example if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:18.600" style="s2">have a mouse that weighs 100 grams and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:22.830" style="s2">and it has the same metabolic rate X and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">I double its mass to 200 grams I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.830" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">in fact double it its metabolism in fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:28.470" style="s2">right you&#39;re still going because my 100%</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:30.930" style="s2">and increase it by only eighty-five</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">percent more or less like I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.930" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">trying to brush broad brush into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">zone here and this the sub linear</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:38.730" style="s2">scaling is very fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:43.130" style="s2">characteristic you might even see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.730" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">at the very heart of living systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.130" end="00:03:48.630" style="s2">specifically dissipative systems I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:50.820" style="s2">but in any event living systems so with</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.630" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">you looking at cells or organisms we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:54.120" style="s2">looking at mammals or reptiles whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at by the way trees or</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.120" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2">forests right entire ecosystems that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">multi species you still see these seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:04.500" style="s2">this exact same kind of sub linear</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">scaling dynamic and that&#39;s huge is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.500" end="00:04:09.989" style="s2">an enormous ly important finding and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">talks about for example how systems have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.989" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">limits to growth built in elephants are</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:15.330" style="s2">kind of as big as they&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">blue wheels are as big as they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.330" end="00:04:20.100" style="s2">get in the context of that particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">niche for example and when they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.100" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">start looking at human systems they</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.370" style="s2">found the human systems also more or</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:26.760" style="s2">less and we give you the exception a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.370" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.760" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">fell under the same rule</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:37.069" style="s2">so if I take a corporation and I add</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:41.159" style="s2">more people I don&#39;t for example increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.069" end="00:04:43.889" style="s2">revenue per person linearly actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.159" end="00:04:45.710" style="s2">increases I&#39;m kind of like a asymptotes</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.889" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">so when I go from a thousand people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.710" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">two thousand people I don&#39;t double the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">revenue per person in fact I attend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:54.900" style="s2">actually each per capita input reduces</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">which means that corporations have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.900" end="00:04:58.349" style="s2">natural asymptote at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">you&#39;re just not getting any more</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.349" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">productivity out of the individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">you&#39;re adding into the system we also</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:08.729" style="s2">seen for example cities that if you take</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">a look at the population of a city and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.729" end="00:05:13.110" style="s2">you look at for example the length of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:16.259" style="s2">roads in the city or the sort of length</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.110" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">total measure of say telephone lines or</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.259" end="00:05:21.060" style="s2">ours or sewers the same basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:22.919" style="s2">characteristic if I double the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.060" end="00:05:24.539" style="s2">population of a city the the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.919" end="00:05:27.659" style="s2">the length of roads does not double it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.539" end="00:05:28.770" style="s2">increases by eighty five percent okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.659" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">that&#39;s cool so what&#39;s that saying is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.770" end="00:05:34.770" style="s2">these human built systems are very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">like biological systems so a city is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.770" end="00:05:40.319" style="s2">like in in this context a city is like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:41.759" style="s2">forest but and this but is the point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.319" end="00:05:45.389" style="s2">this video frankly the plenty entire</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.759" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">series to be perfectly frank with regard</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.389" end="00:05:51.690" style="s2">to other characteristics cities and only</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.300" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">in cities did they find not just not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.690" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">sub linear scaling metric but a super</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:05:59.490" style="s2">linear scaling metric so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:02.370" style="s2">what it meant was that with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.490" end="00:06:04.469" style="s2">something like say income per capita so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a city of a million everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.469" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">makes let&#39;s just say on average ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">thousand dollars a month if I double the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:16.110" style="s2">population of the city the per capita</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:19.889" style="s2">income goes up by about fifteen percent</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.110" end="00:06:21.810" style="s2">so it&#39;s 115 so instead of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.889" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">making $10,000 a month now everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.810" end="00:06:26.430" style="s2">makes eleven thousand five hundred now</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:29.159" style="s2">this is a very important thing because</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.430" end="00:06:32.909" style="s2">it means that if I&#39;m choosing between</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.159" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">city a and city B and City a is a five</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.909" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">hundred thousand person city and city P</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">is a million person city then on average</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">just me being exactly the same nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:48.630" style="s2">about me I will make more money going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:50.130" style="s2">city be about 15% more hardly enough and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.630" end="00:06:52.110" style="s2">by the way if there&#39;s a city see it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.130" end="00:06:54.180" style="s2">two million person city on average I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.110" end="00:06:55.380" style="s2">make more money going to cities see now</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.180" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">of course what that means is that more</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.380" end="00:06:58.230" style="s2">likely I will choose the biggest city</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.120" style="s2">which means the biggest cities gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.230" end="00:07:03.660" style="s2">tend to get bigger and here it is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.120" end="00:07:08.700" style="s2">very powerful thing in some very strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.660" end="00:07:13.320" style="s2">sense cities are to people like stars</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.700" end="00:07:16.140" style="s2">are to atoms there&#39;s a desire sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.320" end="00:07:17.880" style="s2">a gravitational tractor to pack as many</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.140" end="00:07:19.770" style="s2">people as possible into the city cuz do</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.880" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">you increase the population then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.770" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">increase things like wealth and by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:27.450" style="s2">way also innovation so this gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">to a very powerful dynamic just like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.450" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">star by the way where a star kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:32.220" style="s2">wants to collapse to a singularity from</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.630" end="00:07:33.780" style="s2">the point of view of gravity and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.220" end="00:07:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s pushing against the electro Matic</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.780" end="00:07:37.050" style="s2">magnetic force that prevents the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.760" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">from getting any closer together they</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.050" end="00:07:41.250" style="s2">can and that gives you the dynamic of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:43.380" style="s2">star cities have the attractor of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.250" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">wanting to get more people in the city</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.380" end="00:07:49.770" style="s2">to increase the wealth and innovation</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.050" end="00:07:52.950" style="s2">and other variables and it&#39;s facing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.770" end="00:07:55.080" style="s2">repulsor of for example constraints</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.950" end="00:07:57.150" style="s2">around but for one thing people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.080" end="00:07:59.250" style="s2">physical bodies so they have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.150" end="00:08:02.280" style="s2">space it is only until you can pack into</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.250" end="00:08:03.510" style="s2">a particular piece of space or giving</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:05.190" style="s2">them food but there&#39;s only so much food</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.510" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">you can produce in the city if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.190" end="00:08:07.890" style="s2">producing the food out of the city</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:10.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve got transportation so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.890" end="00:08:12.840" style="s2">only walk for example then this one&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.050" end="00:08:14.520" style="s2">far you can bring food and water etc and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.840" end="00:08:18.419" style="s2">also moving waste out of the city as</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.520" end="00:08:20.880" style="s2">constraints and so we see is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.419" end="00:08:22.919" style="s2">seeking on the part of cities to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.880" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">maximally use the technology that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.919" end="00:08:27.710" style="s2">available to them to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:30.630" style="s2">limitations or the constraints of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.710" end="00:08:32.130" style="s2">physical bodies to pack as many human</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.630" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">beings as possible into cities to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.130" end="00:08:36.450" style="s2">thereby get this super linear growth in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">wealth and innovation and other</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.450" end="00:08:42.780" style="s2">characteristics and then effectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:45.530" style="s2">running into the limits of that so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.780" end="00:08:47.730" style="s2">Romans could build aqueducts but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.530" end="00:08:50.670" style="s2">Babylonians couldn&#39;t don&#39;t knock it off</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.730" end="00:08:52.589" style="s2">so yeah limit when we invented the a the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.670" end="00:08:55.070" style="s2">elevators something could go up past</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.589" end="00:08:57.260" style="s2">three or four floors where people could</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.070" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">we walk on stairs and something build</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.260" end="00:09:02.870" style="s2">skyscrapers and talk a lot more people</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:05.780" style="s2">into the same space and okay next piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.870" end="00:09:09.640" style="s2">this piece is by the way substantially</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.780" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">more let&#39;s call it theoretical I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.640" end="00:09:17.990" style="s2">extending this out you creates fragility</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:19.670" style="s2">so the city is endeavouring to spring as</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.990" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">many people into it notice that as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.670" end="00:09:22.280" style="s2">brings more people and it gets more</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:24.380" style="s2">wealth and it gets more innovation so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.280" end="00:09:25.790" style="s2">has the capacity to start trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.380" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">figure out how to solve problems so</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.790" end="00:09:29.420" style="s2">again there was a point at which room</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:30.830" style="s2">couldn&#39;t bring enough water in but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.420" end="00:09:32.270" style="s2">can figure out how to build aqueducts</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.830" end="00:09:34.250" style="s2">they build these aqueducts and pull</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.270" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">water from hundreds of miles away to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.250" end="00:09:39.500" style="s2">able to continue to support the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">population now here&#39;s a proposition the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.500" end="00:09:45.890" style="s2">proposition is effectively the entire</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">population of a region is composed of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.890" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">the city and its support infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:51.980" style="s2">and so the hypothesis is that the city</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">is trying to get as many people as</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:56.210" style="s2">possible into the center and literally</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:09:58.700" style="s2">everything that isn&#39;t in the center is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.210" end="00:10:00.770" style="s2">just support infrastructure so if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.700" end="00:10:02.360" style="s2">look at the contemporary Western world</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.770" end="00:10:04.130" style="s2">in particular you see something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.360" end="00:10:06.020" style="s2">looks like that you&#39;ve got giant cities</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.130" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">that have sort of evaporated the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.020" end="00:10:09.320" style="s2">population out of it out of their local</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:12.590" style="s2">environment created sort of population</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.320" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">deserts except for the location that can</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.590" end="00:10:17.990" style="s2">provide support infrastructure and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:20.210" style="s2">some cases that support infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.990" end="00:10:21.560" style="s2">has to do with locations where people</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.210" end="00:10:25.160" style="s2">who really don&#39;t want to be in cities</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:27.500" style="s2">can still be okay and then what happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.160" end="00:10:29.030" style="s2">is is that the dynamic of packing more</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.500" end="00:10:30.740" style="s2">and more people and pushes it to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.030" end="00:10:33.800" style="s2">limits which means that is optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.740" end="00:10:35.690" style="s2">for the capacity to increase the number</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.800" end="00:10:39.380" style="s2">of people in the city which means that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.690" end="00:10:42.170" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming fragile logistics it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.380" end="00:10:44.360" style="s2">intense as it can food distribution gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.170" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">his intense as it can water distribution</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.360" end="00:10:48.350" style="s2">gets tensed as it can you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:52.400" style="s2">running into situations where by the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.350" end="00:10:54.080" style="s2">things like crime and disease also tend</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.400" end="00:10:55.340" style="s2">to increase super linearly so you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.080" end="00:10:57.320" style="s2">to build techniques to try to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.340" end="00:10:58.550" style="s2">that visa fee innovation innovation</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.320" end="00:11:01.730" style="s2">welfare fighting against crime and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.550" end="00:11:03.470" style="s2">disease and so minor perturbation as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.730" end="00:11:05.030" style="s2">system becomes more and more optimized</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.470" end="00:11:07.470" style="s2">for maximizing population in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.030" end="00:11:09.390" style="s2">particular constraints of technology</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.470" end="00:11:11.190" style="s2">boom you gotta collapse and then that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.390" end="00:11:13.950" style="s2">collapse creates a collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.190" end="00:11:15.660" style="s2">entire civilization so by hypothesis for</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.950" end="00:11:17.730" style="s2">example I would propose that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.660" end="00:11:20.490" style="s2">collapse of the Roman Empire was in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.730" end="00:11:23.130" style="s2">very distinct sense the actual collapse</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.490" end="00:11:26.100" style="s2">of the city of Rome and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.130" end="00:11:27.090" style="s2">was support infrastructure now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.100" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">pretty bold claim and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.090" end="00:11:30.390" style="s2">necessarily need to hang my hat too much</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:36.300" style="s2">on that last piece but the key idea here</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.390" end="00:11:37.800" style="s2">is city attraction repulsion dynamic as</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.300" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">being fundamental to the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.800" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">civilization until now because if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.990" style="s2">think about it if you look at it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.450" style="s2">what you might say what I&#39;m proposing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.990" end="00:11:50.820" style="s2">that the core attractor is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.450" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">the city the dynamic is actually more</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.820" end="00:11:56.670" style="s2">abstract and what we&#39;ve seen in the city</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:58.590" style="s2">is really just the fact that bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.670" end="00:12:00.630" style="s2">human beings in bed and bodies the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.590" end="00:12:03.230" style="s2">that really wants to happen the thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.630" end="00:12:06.770" style="s2">the real driver of the super linear</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.230" end="00:12:09.180" style="s2">scaling metric is Minds in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.770" end="00:12:13.010" style="s2">intelligence distinct intelligences</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.180" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">interacting through some mechanism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.010" end="00:12:17.820" style="s2">it&#39;s because minds are embodied that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:19.890" style="s2">have cities up until very recently the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.820" end="00:12:21.510" style="s2">only way for minds to interact if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.890" end="00:12:24.030" style="s2">had bring bodies relatively close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.510" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">each other and those are subject to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.030" end="00:12:28.200" style="s2">constraints of effectively travel and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:30.660" style="s2">now more recently telecommunications but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.200" end="00:12:33.470" style="s2">telecommunications has been relatively</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.660" end="00:12:35.820" style="s2">weak like a telegraph telephone</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.470" end="00:12:37.410" style="s2">television these various kinds of media</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.820" end="00:12:39.530" style="s2">that created the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.410" end="00:12:41.730" style="s2">interaction relationship over</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.500" end="00:12:48.690" style="s2">strong enough to overcome the</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">the next wave of virtual reality have</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">enough possibility of relationship in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:15.180" style="s2">the virtual that we can in fact decouple</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:17.490" style="s2">the attractor and the repulsion so thus</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.180" end="00:13:20.220" style="s2">idiom is a concept based on that premise</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.490" end="00:13:22.890" style="s2">the CVM is a concept that says</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:24.930" style="s2">if we can render unto the virtual what</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.890" end="00:13:26.580" style="s2">is best done in the virtual and render</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.930" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">into the physical what is best under the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.580" end="00:13:30.540" style="s2">physical and then bring those back into</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2">proper relationship we can change the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.540" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">whole game that&#39;s what I mean what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">mean is creative generative</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:41.730" style="s2">collaboration in the virtual and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">here we can in fact have a single city</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.730" end="00:13:45.240" style="s2">one place for all minds at least in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:46.470" style="s2">principle can be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.240" end="00:13:48.660" style="s2">with each other they can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.470" end="00:13:51.390" style="s2">they can interrelate no longer</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.660" end="00:13:54.360" style="s2">constrained in the same way by</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.390" end="00:13:56.190" style="s2">physicality and by the way this also</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.360" end="00:13:58.170" style="s2">means that we have to be thinking very</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.190" end="00:13:59.550" style="s2">clearly about what are the right ways to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.170" end="00:14:00.690" style="s2">bring those minds into relationship how</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.550" end="00:14:02.220" style="s2">do we actually build this virtual</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.690" end="00:14:03.690" style="s2">environment so it&#39;s maximally generative</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.220" end="00:14:04.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole new space we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.690" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">take this seriously not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.890" end="00:14:09.510" style="s2">going to be not an adjunct to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:12.680" style="s2">civilization but a fully symmetric basis</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.510" end="00:14:15.780" style="s2">to civilization with the physical side</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:18.060" style="s2">now by the way this implies that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.780" end="00:14:20.730" style="s2">should get significant increases in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.060" end="00:14:22.740" style="s2">wealth and innovation if I can take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.730" end="00:14:24.630" style="s2">biggest cities in the world and increase</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.740" end="00:14:27.030" style="s2">them by what about seven or eight</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.630" end="00:14:28.470" style="s2">doublings I&#39;m increasing wealth by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.030" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">so for example if I take the population</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.470" end="00:14:34.470" style="s2">of Tokyo and now move that to include</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">the entire human population the average</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.470" end="00:14:39.210" style="s2">income would go up by about three or</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:42.990" style="s2">five X there&#39;s a lot okay so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.210" end="00:14:44.610" style="s2">side on the other side when I have made</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.990" end="00:14:46.230" style="s2">this decoupling and now buy it is are</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.610" end="00:14:48.500" style="s2">not being squeezed together because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.230" end="00:14:51.470" style="s2">body is the substrate for relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.500" end="00:14:52.680" style="s2">now the bodies can be returned to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.470" end="00:14:56.220" style="s2">humaneness</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.680" end="00:14:58.410" style="s2">to a more humane way of living living in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.220" end="00:15:00.450" style="s2">the tomorrow limit you&#39;re living among</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.410" end="00:15:03.390" style="s2">people who you know well strong link</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.450" end="00:15:05.160" style="s2">relationships family community living in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.390" end="00:15:07.170" style="s2">nature making sure that the place that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.160" end="00:15:10.640" style="s2">you&#39;re living is built at human scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.170" end="00:15:12.930" style="s2">very walkable very quiet low toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.640" end="00:15:16.310" style="s2">where you always have relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.930" end="00:15:20.970" style="s2">being in the earth being in nature and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.310" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">and and by the way I suspect that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.970" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">is not just awesome</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:27.870" style="s2">I know not only does it does it give us</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:32.010" style="s2">back a whole bunch of values that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.870" end="00:15:33.540" style="s2">had to give up in the context of the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.010" end="00:15:35.670" style="s2">gluttony of the city</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.540" end="00:15:38.759" style="s2">I suspect it&#39;s actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.670" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">obligate to enable the virtual to be as</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.759" end="00:15:42.509" style="s2">powerful as it needs to be so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:46.529" style="s2">example imagine most people now are</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.509" end="00:15:48.149" style="s2">experiencing the fact that interaction</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.529" end="00:15:49.790" style="s2">via the virtual like food say for</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.149" end="00:15:51.569" style="s2">example in a zoom conference is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.790" end="00:15:53.190" style="s2">substantially more draining than</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.569" end="00:15:55.589" style="s2">interaction in the physical mind if I if</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.190" end="00:15:57.690" style="s2">I&#39;m in a room of 12 people I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.589" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">conversation with 12 people for me at</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.690" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">least as an introvert it&#39;s very draining</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.230" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">but it&#39;s training us can say X but if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:06.990" style="s2">have that same length of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">with those same 12 people but it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.990" end="00:16:12.329" style="s2">in a zoom call it is substantially more</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:17.699" style="s2">draining let&#39;s say 2x it&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.329" end="00:16:20.130" style="s2">pipe X but whatever now imagine if when</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.699" end="00:16:22.410" style="s2">you finish that zoom conference instead</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.130" end="00:16:24.540" style="s2">of dropping back into your body in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.410" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">context that you&#39;re in now you dropped</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">into a context that is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:32.339" style="s2">nurturing for human beings you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:33.870" style="s2">to go sit under a shade tree next to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.339" end="00:16:35.880" style="s2">running water maybe even swim in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.870" end="00:16:37.319" style="s2">water or we could go out and interact</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.880" end="00:16:40.380" style="s2">with people with whom you have very</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.319" end="00:16:41.940" style="s2">healthy relationship and do something</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.380" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">together like build a wall or digging</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.940" end="00:16:46.110" style="s2">the garden or whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:47.699" style="s2">that if a is very human how much more</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.110" end="00:16:50.220" style="s2">grounding that is and returns your</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.699" end="00:16:52.350" style="s2">nervous system back to a state of health</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.220" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">so that you can then cycle back into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.350" end="00:16:55.589" style="s2">virtual and extend that creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:16:57.870" style="s2">then generativity like this movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.589" end="00:16:58.920" style="s2">between the virtual and the physical not</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.870" end="00:17:01.829" style="s2">becomes something that we can really</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.920" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">couple read couple in a right way and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.829" end="00:17:06.689" style="s2">get a lot more out of it and a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">out of it that is healthy so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.689" end="00:17:10.350" style="s2">notion all right so the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:12.630" style="s2">that we can take this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.350" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">powerful generator of wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.630" end="00:17:17.069" style="s2">innovation that has been captured in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.140" style="s2">city which has a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.069" end="00:17:20.850" style="s2">characteristics of forcing us into</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.140" end="00:17:21.900" style="s2">situations that are increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.850" end="00:17:25.230" style="s2">inhumane</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.900" end="00:17:27.990" style="s2">not healthy for humans and pop that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.230" end="00:17:30.840" style="s2">apart and increase it by a factor of 5</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.990" end="00:17:32.190" style="s2">to 7 at the virtual level so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.840" end="00:17:34.169" style="s2">something more generative than the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.190" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">cities that ever dreamed of being but at</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.169" end="00:17:39.510" style="s2">the same time recover and get back all</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:43.470" style="s2">of the human scale living that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.510" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">to surrender and return to that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.470" end="00:17:47.340" style="s2">wholesomeness of life the the many of us</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:50.340" style="s2">I think yearns for an</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.340" end="00:17:54.990" style="s2">here we are I where we&#39;re in that pivot</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.340" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">point the quarantine has shown us</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.990" end="00:17:59.340" style="s2">whether we like it or not that many of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:00.860" style="s2">the things that we have had to know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.340" end="00:18:03.450" style="s2">these have thought we had to do in</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.450" end="00:18:09.450" style="s2">learning environments much of that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.850" end="00:18:10.920" style="s2">be done virtually in fact depending on</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.450" end="00:18:12.810" style="s2">how the next several months play out</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.920" end="00:18:13.890" style="s2">much of it will continue to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.810" end="00:18:15.780" style="s2">done virtually so we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.890" end="00:18:17.730" style="s2">having to learn those skills and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.780" end="00:18:20.580" style="s2">gives rise to an opportunity to extend</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.730" end="00:18:22.200" style="s2">into that into the experiment and see mm</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.580" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">okay what does that look like if we make</p>
