<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.670" style="s2">so hi my name is Jill brewer and in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.360" end="00:00:08.179" style="s2">short video I want to share a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.670" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">presentation that I&#39;ve put together</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.179" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">explaining the larger vision for</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">creating culture design labs as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">helping humanity deal with the global</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">crisis so first off let me share that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:25.470" style="s2">right now it is currently not possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">to guide the evolution of social systems</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.470" end="00:00:31.880" style="s2">in the world so we have political</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">systems economies communities urban</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.880" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">development processes technology design</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">and so on that are happening without any</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">ability to set collective actions around</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">shared intention and purpose and this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:50.989" style="s2">a really serious problem for us because</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:54.059" style="s2">of the number of friends that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.989" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">dominating the changes in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">take place at an exponential scale so</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">most of us are familiar with how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">technology is changing and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">have paradigm shifts and how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">communicate or the tools that we use</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">over a period of a few years but there</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">are other exponential processes that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:13.020" style="s2">dominating in the world today and just</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">one example to give you a sense is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.020" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">population growth if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">trends in human population in the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">100 years it&#39;s been growing in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">exponential rate which is causing us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">have tremendous negative impacts on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">planet itself so these exponential</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">change processes are dominating in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">world and this is causing very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">forms of cultural evolution yet that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">evolution is not happening in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">conscious or intentional manner so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">need to change this situation quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">desperately the reason we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">this is that the current trajectory for</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">our planetary system is overshoot and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">collapse so we can see this with global</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">warming where we&#39;re moving into a realm</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">of runaway climate change if we continue</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:05.610" style="s2">to increase the amount of fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:06.900" style="s2">burned each year grow the human</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">population and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.900" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">deplete more resources as we drive the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:16.350" style="s2">planet further and further into a motive</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">instability and disruption so this</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.350" end="00:02:21.300" style="s2">trajectory you know whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:23.220" style="s2">thinking about it in terms of the models</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.300" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">developed in the 1970s where the Club of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.220" end="00:02:27.600" style="s2">Rome or more recently by the Stockholm</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:29.790" style="s2">resilience center where they have nine</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.600" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">planetary boundaries any of which</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.790" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">crossed in planetary civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:37.710" style="s2">becomes untenable currently according to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">the best estimates we&#39;ve crossed four of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.710" end="00:02:41.550" style="s2">those nine boundaries so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">is we&#39;re currently on a pathway to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:47.250" style="s2">catastrophic collapse at a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">scale and we need to learn how to guide</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.250" end="00:02:52.470" style="s2">cultural evolution for our societies and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">we need to do this very quickly one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.470" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">the things that gets in the way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:59.370" style="s2">this is that the knowledge that we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.220" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">to apply to be able to guide the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.370" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">evolution of our very complex societies</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">is mostly fragmented and silos at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">moment one place where you can really</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">see this as in universities or we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">organized our knowledge into academic</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:16.050" style="s2">departments and disciplines where</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">biology and chemistry are is governed by</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.050" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">separate researchers and management</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">practices hiring practices admissions</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">for students and so on and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:27.750" style="s2">this situation where our knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">deeply fragmented yet all of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.750" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">effective interventions and solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">need to be holistic and integrated so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">have to do design work on the process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">creating knowledge itself to help us</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">making a problem solvable and this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">what I call the predicament of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:48.390" style="s2">which has two parts one is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:50.580" style="s2">making new knowledge at such a fast rate</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.390" end="00:03:52.320" style="s2">that we can&#39;t keep up with it this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.580" end="00:03:55.049" style="s2">one of the patterns of exponential</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.320" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">growth in the world today when we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">several million people getting PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:01.950" style="s2">every year we&#39;re producing more</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">knowledge than we know how to handle and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.950" end="00:04:06.299" style="s2">it&#39;s coming more quickly than we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:08.310" style="s2">possibly process so the predicament of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.299" end="00:04:10.290" style="s2">knowledge has two parts one is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.310" end="00:04:13.080" style="s2">there&#39;s too much of it for us to handle</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.290" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">in any kind of reasonable ineffective</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.080" end="00:04:16.459" style="s2">way and the other is that we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:19.509" style="s2">new knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.459" end="00:04:22.820" style="s2">fast-pace that our ability to guide</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.509" end="00:04:24.220" style="s2">social learning to incorporate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.820" end="00:04:27.560" style="s2">assimilate this knowledge into our</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:30.380" style="s2">institutions and practices is greatly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.560" end="00:04:31.970" style="s2">mismatched we learn socially much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.380" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">slowly than we are currently producing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.970" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">knowledge so this predicament is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:40.100" style="s2">problematic because you know by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">assessments I&#39;ve been doing seems like</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.100" end="00:04:43.100" style="s2">we have all of the knowledge we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.620" style="s2">solve all of the major problems in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.100" end="00:04:48.199" style="s2">world and yet is fragmented and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.620" end="00:04:50.270" style="s2">being implemented or absorbed into our</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.199" end="00:04:52.370" style="s2">institutions rapidly enough for us to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.270" end="00:04:54.099" style="s2">so so we have this predicament of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.370" end="00:04:57.080" style="s2">knowledge that we need to deal with but</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.099" end="00:05:00.050" style="s2">now let me give you a really inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.080" end="00:05:02.509" style="s2">idea which is that every community on</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.050" end="00:05:04.789" style="s2">earth whether it&#39;s a small village or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.509" end="00:05:06.530" style="s2">mega city with millions of people is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.789" end="00:05:08.419" style="s2">potentially a field site for doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.530" end="00:05:10.849" style="s2">research and applied cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.419" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">what I mean by this is that we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.849" end="00:05:15.889" style="s2">the best integrative social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:17.990" style="s2">together and create field sites for</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.889" end="00:05:21.409" style="s2">monitoring and tracking social change</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.990" end="00:05:23.539" style="s2">and all communities on earth now we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.409" end="00:05:27.289" style="s2">create networks of them to help us learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.539" end="00:05:30.669" style="s2">so as the world changes we&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.289" end="00:05:33.050" style="s2">that the ability to learn about how each</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.669" end="00:05:35.419" style="s2">community is either adapted to its</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.050" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">environment or not will help us to learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.419" end="00:05:41.030" style="s2">the skill of guiding cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">at large scales now of course some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.030" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">our communities are going to prove to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:46.970" style="s2">resilient and adaptive in their</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:50.330" style="s2">environments and there are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.970" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">continue to grow flourish and thrive</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.330" end="00:05:56.060" style="s2">into the future but that&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.590" style="s2">for all communities there&#39;s one estimate</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.060" end="00:05:59.509" style="s2">that really stands out to me which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.590" end="00:06:03.620" style="s2">that in the Great Plains of the North</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.509" end="00:06:05.570" style="s2">America in the United States 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.620" end="00:06:08.659" style="s2">cities and towns that have populations</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.570" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">of less than 50,000 people or going into</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.659" end="00:06:13.699" style="s2">decline what this means is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:16.250" style="s2">going to see many of these small to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.699" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">medium sized towns disappear and go away</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.250" end="00:06:20.750" style="s2">in the next 50 to 100 years so while</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:23.449" style="s2">some communities are going to flourish</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.750" end="00:06:25.969" style="s2">and thrive quite a few others are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.449" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">to die out and this is Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.969" end="00:06:29.940" style="s2">evolution in play where</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.650" style="s2">the things that are well adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.940" end="00:06:34.320" style="s2">their environments will remain fit and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.650" end="00:06:35.820" style="s2">be able to continue to exist whereas</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:37.380" style="s2">those things that are not adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.820" end="00:06:40.320" style="s2">their environment will die off and go</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.380" end="00:06:42.419" style="s2">away now if we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.320" end="00:06:44.010" style="s2">places that will become resilient what</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.419" end="00:06:45.419" style="s2">we see is that there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.010" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">already known about what makes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.419" end="00:06:49.590" style="s2">community resilient and the picture I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:52.380" style="s2">showing here is of these sue backs and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.590" end="00:06:55.590" style="s2">the country of Bali and Sue backs are</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.380" end="00:06:57.600" style="s2">these tiered form of Agriculture that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.590" end="00:06:59.040" style="s2">they use for growing rice and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.600" end="00:07:00.210" style="s2">amazing about the Sue backs is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.040" end="00:07:02.070" style="s2">they&#39;re well adapted to their</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.210" end="00:07:04.919" style="s2">environment that they&#39;re appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.070" end="00:07:08.310" style="s2">diverse in the management practices for</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.919" end="00:07:10.500" style="s2">how different farmers manage the land</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.310" end="00:07:12.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s deeply integrated into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.500" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">political economic and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.690" end="00:07:16.919" style="s2">traditions of their culture and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:19.169" style="s2">they&#39;re able to be self monitor ating</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.919" end="00:07:22.350" style="s2">and this is a cultural tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.169" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">has lasted for a very long time so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.350" end="00:07:26.490" style="s2">actually know quite a lot especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">from research by the historians and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.490" end="00:07:31.200" style="s2">anthropologists about how to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:33.539" style="s2">resilient communities but what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.200" end="00:07:36.180" style="s2">have right now is the ability to set up</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.539" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">monitoring and guiding of current</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.180" end="00:07:41.850" style="s2">communities to have more of them become</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:43.950" style="s2">so now I want to pause here for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.850" end="00:07:46.470" style="s2">and draw attention to something that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.950" end="00:07:48.630" style="s2">think is extremely important and that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.470" end="00:07:50.729" style="s2">that right now we are leaving which</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.630" end="00:07:53.669" style="s2">communities thrive and become resilient</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.729" end="00:07:57.990" style="s2">and which communities collapse and go</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.669" end="00:08:00.330" style="s2">away entirely up to chance so well this</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.990" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">is because we are not becoming active</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2">managers of cultural evolution and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:08.310" style="s2">I want to share with you is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:10.950" style="s2">that life is too precious to be left to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.310" end="00:08:13.139" style="s2">chance so we need to be rigorous and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.950" end="00:08:15.060" style="s2">systematic about building an applied</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.139" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">science of cultural evolution for</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.060" end="00:08:20.280" style="s2">communities around the world and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">where we get to the idea of culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.280" end="00:08:25.410" style="s2">design culture design as I like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:27.389" style="s2">describe it is an integrative social</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.410" end="00:08:29.880" style="s2">science that can help us dive the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.389" end="00:08:32.070" style="s2">evolution of entire communities so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.880" end="00:08:33.930" style="s2">the individual people within them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.070" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">the entire communities become more</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.930" end="00:08:38.209" style="s2">healthy and Rizzo</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:40.069" style="s2">in a changing world and we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.209" end="00:08:42.409" style="s2">this during a time when there are going</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.069" end="00:08:43.939" style="s2">to be more disruptions disasters and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.409" end="00:08:45.649" style="s2">crises than we&#39;ve ever had to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.939" end="00:08:49.249" style="s2">in the history of our species</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.649" end="00:08:51.410" style="s2">so with all of those exponential trends</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.249" end="00:08:53.749" style="s2">driving change in the world we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.410" end="00:08:58.850" style="s2">see more hurricanes and tornadoes</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.749" end="00:09:01.160" style="s2">wildfires we are going to see more air</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.850" end="00:09:02.769" style="s2">erratic weather and unpredictability for</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.160" end="00:09:04.879" style="s2">managing agriculture and food production</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.769" end="00:09:06.860" style="s2">things like this that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.879" end="00:09:09.110" style="s2">happen all over the world because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.860" end="00:09:11.269" style="s2">global warming and the deterioration of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.110" end="00:09:13.550" style="s2">our environment and so during the very</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.269" end="00:09:15.559" style="s2">time when all of that those disruptions</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.550" end="00:09:18.680" style="s2">are happening or when we need to build</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.559" end="00:09:20.449" style="s2">this field of culture design and create</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.680" end="00:09:22.970" style="s2">networks of communities around the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.449" end="00:09:26.180" style="s2">that are operating as field sites for</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.970" end="00:09:28.519" style="s2">applied cultural evolution now in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.180" end="00:09:30.499" style="s2">work to help build this capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.519" end="00:09:32.540" style="s2">culture design labs around the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.499" end="00:09:34.999" style="s2">I&#39;m currently partnering with the Oregon</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.540" end="00:09:37.309" style="s2">Research Institute in Eugene which is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.999" end="00:09:40.220" style="s2">place that has a tradition for more than</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.309" end="00:09:42.319" style="s2">60 years of building the field of Public</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.220" end="00:09:44.029" style="s2">Health and applied behavioral science</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.319" end="00:09:46.519" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.029" end="00:09:48.319" style="s2">evolution Society that I&#39;ve been the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.519" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">coordinator to help build which</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.319" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">currently has about 2,000 researchers</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:55.100" style="s2">around the world in more than 50</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">countries who study cultural change from</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.100" end="00:09:59.209" style="s2">a variety of different disciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:02.089" style="s2">perspectives all of which are informed</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.209" end="00:10:04.249" style="s2">by an evolutionary approach and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.089" end="00:10:08.509" style="s2">there&#39;s the evolution Institute which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.249" end="00:10:10.069" style="s2">a small nonprofit that coordinates the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.509" end="00:10:12.889" style="s2">bringing together of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.069" end="00:10:15.189" style="s2">research and evolutionary studies both</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.889" end="00:10:18.050" style="s2">biological and cultural evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.189" end="00:10:20.120" style="s2">helps to translate that into materials</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.050" end="00:10:22.819" style="s2">that are easily understood while also</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.120" end="00:10:24.379" style="s2">doing things like the project that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.819" end="00:10:26.929" style="s2">have to build the cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.379" end="00:10:28.999" style="s2">Society which was a project incubated at</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.929" end="00:10:30.589" style="s2">the evolution Institute and so I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.999" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">the process of building formal</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.589" end="00:10:36.290" style="s2">relationships between these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:40.129" style="s2">and other partners so that we can build</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.290" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">this capacity for guiding evolution at a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.129" end="00:10:45.710" style="s2">planetary scale so with that in mind I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:48.050" style="s2">say let&#39;s get together and play</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.710" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">we have very important work to do time</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.050" end="00:10:53.330" style="s2">is short and this vision for creating</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:55.339" style="s2">field sites for applied cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.330" end="00:10:57.800" style="s2">evolution in communities around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.339" end="00:11:03.190" style="s2">world is needed more urgently than ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.800" end="00:11:03.190" style="s2">before thank you and let&#39;s get to work</p>
