<p begin="00:00:05.910" end="00:00:11.730" style="s2">that is so antithetical to human</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.179" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">wellbeing well I&#39;d like to share with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.730" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">you a story that is historically valid</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">and factual that explains how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">a theory of human nature it has</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">completely ungrounded in science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">actually in direct contradiction to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:31.529" style="s2">science I has come to be the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">paradigm for economic activity in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.529" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">world today now this theory that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">alluding to is called the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">rational action it&#39;s sometimes also</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">called rational choice theory or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">rational actor model and essentially it</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">says that the foundation of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:54.710" style="s2">is that we are self-interest maximizers</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">you can almost think of us as being like</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.710" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">robots that calculate our best interest</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">for every decision where we take on one</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">out of a decision and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">the negative things what are called the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:13.979" style="s2">costs I and are the benefits and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">costs and then we weigh them against</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.979" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">each other and somehow we come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">solution that is going to maximize our</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">utility or in other words give us the</p>

<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">theory was not developed by behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:37.159" style="s2">scientists in fact it came from the RAND</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">Corporation in the 1940s and 1950s and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.159" end="00:01:41.390" style="s2">it was not developed by psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">instead it was developed by</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.390" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">mathematicians and strategists and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">helpful to have a little bit of context</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">that the RAND Corporation which is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">non-profit think tank set up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">California was actually put in place by</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:59.790" style="s2">the Air Force after World War two they</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">the Air Force had gotten a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">lucrative defense contracts during World</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">War two to build aircraft and ships to</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">the aircraft and so on and they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">to have a neutral body or an</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">organization that appeared to be neutral</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:18.599" style="s2">that could advocate on their behalf for</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.599" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">in competition with the army of the Navy</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">in the Marines and so they set up the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">RAND Corporation to try to secure</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">contracts for the Air Force and one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:34.920" style="s2">the things that came about after World</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:38.610" style="s2">War two ended was the rise of the Cold</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.920" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">War in this conflict between or this</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.610" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">economic competition between the Soviet</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2">and Western Allies on the other and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.650" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">group of mathematicians were hired by</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">the rand corporation to explore ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:58.260" style="s2">that the Air Force could benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">this emerging tension between these two</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.260" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">players and they came up with what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:05.220" style="s2">now known as game theory basically a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">group of mathematicians came together</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.220" end="00:03:11.580" style="s2">and export strategies and they created</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">games or call them rules for interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.580" end="00:03:16.350" style="s2">that let them create scenarios and run</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:18.090" style="s2">them and test them and these scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.350" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">were based on assumptions about human</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.090" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">nature so rational choice theory or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">theory of rational action was developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:27.090" style="s2">as part of these game theories being</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">developed by mathematicians at the RAND</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.090" end="00:03:31.170" style="s2">Corporation in partnership with other</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:35.030" style="s2">places but really it was the nexus for</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">all that work and one of those games</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.030" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">rather crudely was called fuck you buddy</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.560" end="00:03:45.060" style="s2">now we know it as the prisoner&#39;s dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:46.739" style="s2">and it was a scenario where there were</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.060" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">two actors competing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.739" end="00:03:50.609" style="s2">where each of them had incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">information about the other and they had</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.609" end="00:03:55.709" style="s2">to decide whether they were cooperate or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:57.569" style="s2">whether they would not cooperate and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.709" end="00:04:00.870" style="s2">mathematical solution that was given the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.569" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">best outcome was to basically to lie to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.870" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">pretend that one was going to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:06.900" style="s2">with their opponent and then cheat them</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">at the last minute to screw them over so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.900" end="00:04:11.609" style="s2">that they maintained the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.049" style="s2">situation where they would not give</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.609" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2">anything to the other person but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">might trick the other person into giving</p>

<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">to be the best outcome interestingly the</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.900" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">men and this was during a time when</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.430" end="00:04:40.660" style="s2">there was a widespread prejudice that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:43.780" style="s2">treated women as though they were not</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.780" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">this study where they had the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.250" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">secretaries in their office do this</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:58.510" style="s2">of the game and cooperated with each</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.380" end="00:05:12.310" style="s2">researchers in their prejudice just said</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:14.620" style="s2">well women are irrational so of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.310" end="00:05:16.419" style="s2">they don&#39;t follow the rules of rational</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.580" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">confirms the bias of the researchers but</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:30.099" style="s2">rational action was then taken over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:32.950" style="s2">next 40 to 50 years to build an entire</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.099" end="00:05:35.710" style="s2">global economic system based on it which</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.950" end="00:05:39.190" style="s2">is laissez-faire economics it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.710" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">called neoclassical economics I the sad</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.190" end="00:05:43.870" style="s2">thing is that behavioral scientists</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t start questioning the assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.870" end="00:05:48.849" style="s2">of rational choice theory for several</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.880" end="00:05:51.389" style="s2">decades actually not until the mid-1970s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.849" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">when a research project was undertaken</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.389" end="00:05:57.460" style="s2">led by researchers like Daniel Kahneman</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:03.340" style="s2">really to do experimental studies to see</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.169" end="00:06:06.039" style="s2">if the assumptions of rational choice</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.340" end="00:06:07.810" style="s2">they were valid and interestingly the</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.810" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">behavioral scientists not only did they</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.330" end="00:06:14.979" style="s2">not support rational choice theory but</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">they contradicted it and invalidated in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.979" end="00:06:19.270" style="s2">really profound ways one specific way</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:21.430" style="s2">that they did that just to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.270" end="00:06:24.360" style="s2">sense is that the mathematics of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.430" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">rational choice theory requires that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.360" end="00:06:29.620" style="s2">preferences remain constant across time</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:32.979" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s in mathematics is called the</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.979" end="00:06:38.169" style="s2">must always equal B plus a but if a and</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.860" end="00:06:49.240" style="s2">by psychologists showed that you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.110" end="00:06:51.250" style="s2">reverse people&#39;s preferences by changing</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:53.290" style="s2">the way that you frame the question so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.250" end="00:06:55.270" style="s2">you frame the question in one way and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.290" end="00:06:57.580" style="s2">you get people to come out with option a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.270" end="00:06:58.750" style="s2">is better than option B and you frame in</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.580" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">a different way that&#39;s logically</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.750" end="00:07:03.130" style="s2">equivalent but has a different emotional</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:04.360" style="s2">tone to it and you would get people to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.130" end="00:07:07.000" style="s2">change their preference and say they</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.360" end="00:07:09.430" style="s2">prefer be over a so the long and short</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.000" end="00:07:12.729" style="s2">of it is that when behavioral scientists</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.430" end="00:07:14.350" style="s2">started studying the questions the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.729" end="00:07:15.539" style="s2">assumptions rather underlying rational</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.350" end="00:07:18.370" style="s2">choice theory they immediately</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.539" end="00:07:20.229" style="s2">invalidated it and actually the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.370" end="00:07:22.360" style="s2">psychologist currently the only</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.229" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">psychologist to get a Nobel Prize in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.360" end="00:07:27.940" style="s2">Economics was Daniel Kahneman for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:30.190" style="s2">work so it&#39;s helpful to to ask ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.940" end="00:07:32.110" style="s2">this question if we have assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:34.180" style="s2">about human nature that go into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.110" end="00:07:35.800" style="s2">design of our global institutions all</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.180" end="00:07:38.110" style="s2">the way to the level of the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.800" end="00:07:41.020" style="s2">global economy and those assumptions are</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.110" end="00:07:44.250" style="s2">based on philosophical ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.020" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">not grounded in fact and in an actuality</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.250" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">contradict how real human nature works</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.080" end="00:07:52.539" style="s2">then we&#39;ve got a conundrum and so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:56.950" style="s2">we need to do to remedy that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.539" end="00:07:59.020" style="s2">problem is to have what two cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.950" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">scientists George leg off and Mark</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.020" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">Johnson call empirically responsible</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:07.030" style="s2">philosophy which is that you use</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:09.099" style="s2">empirical methods like the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.030" end="00:08:11.620" style="s2">studies done by psychologists in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.099" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">to question the assumptions of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.620" end="00:08:15.880" style="s2">philosophy before you implement them so</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:19.479" style="s2">that you can improve upon your own</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.880" end="00:08:22.090" style="s2">internal ideological biases so this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.479" end="00:08:24.449" style="s2">just a quick example of how the story of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.090" end="00:08:28.449" style="s2">the rise of rational choice theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.449" end="00:08:30.039" style="s2">should cause us to take caution and be</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.449" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">more systematic and rigorous than the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.039" end="00:08:34.709" style="s2">methods that we use to determine how we</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.770" end="00:08:37.450" style="s2">develop our theories of human nature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.709" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">another lesson that we can take away</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.450" end="00:08:41.080" style="s2">from this is that the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:42.550" style="s2">behavioral sciences studies in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.080" end="00:08:44.980" style="s2">psychology and neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.550" end="00:08:47.860" style="s2">linguistics and other fields can help</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.980" end="00:08:51.339" style="s2">guide our theory building in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.860" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">as well so it actually goes both ways so</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.339" end="00:08:53.290" style="s2">there you have it that&#39;s the story of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:55.570" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.290" end="00:08:58.089" style="s2">rise of rational choice theory and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.570" end="00:09:01.060" style="s2">it was establishing a set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.089" end="00:09:02.949" style="s2">presumptions about human nature that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.060" end="00:09:05.139" style="s2">were later invalidated by cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.949" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">science and so now as we move forward</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.139" end="00:09:09.250" style="s2">and we ask ourselves how do we build a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">global economy that works for human</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.250" end="00:09:15.940" style="s2">beings we&#39;d better be sure to take the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:17.319" style="s2">sciences of human nature that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.940" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">telling us how human beings actually</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:25.620" style="s2">design process thank you and I hope this</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:25.620" style="s2">is useful for you</p>
