<p begin="00:00:02.210" end="00:00:08.280" style="s2">what I found particularly helpful was</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.569" end="00:00:10.670" style="s2">arriving here and it being mostly</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.280" end="00:00:13.139" style="s2">strangers and by the end of the weekend</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.670" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">we&#39;re able to offer each other insights</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.139" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">that are deeply powerful and very</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:21.029" style="s2">insightful that not just make me feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:23.330" style="s2">good at the moment but I can take away</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.029" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">in harness in my everyday life it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.330" end="00:00:32.250" style="s2">teaching somebody a set of ideas it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">enabling people to feel what it actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.250" end="00:00:37.340" style="s2">feels like to be a man and in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">honoring what it is to be a man and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.340" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">the love from contributions from women</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">as well so I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">this kind of work exists right now I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">truly believe that men need the support</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">of other men to heal certain things in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">themselves and to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">brotherhood and connection with other</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">men to learn how to be a man and very</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">few of us got this from our fathers so</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">being able to give this to each other in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:03.570" style="s2">a space like this is really valuable</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:06.090" style="s2">every man should do this you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">like there&#39;s not enough good positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.090" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">role models and information for men</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:14.040" style="s2">there educates men on how to be better</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2">men and we all need them as a species</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">there is a real act of courage require</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:23.550" style="s2">to fully show up and tell the truth to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">other men and you know for me doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.550" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">come naturally necessarily to give that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:30.180" style="s2">level of trust but the more the space</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">builds and the more the trust builds</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.180" end="00:01:34.259" style="s2">within the group the easier that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">and then the feeling is one not just of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.259" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">release but one of dignity and strength</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:43.289" style="s2">and being kind of fully in my power I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:47.090" style="s2">felt freedom to just let go and not hold</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.289" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">back and that was really liberating and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.090" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">also just makes you see how everyday you</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">go and make yourself small and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">compromise and you don&#39;t step fully into</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">your potential and that that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">something I really felt in that room I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">getting a glimpse of hey what if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">just dared it was incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.299" style="s2">constructive it you know things I am a</p>
