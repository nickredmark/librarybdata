<p begin="00:03:51.569" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s right anyway going back</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">to radicalize as I read the four</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:02.730" style="s2">novellas I took away the sense that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">was all about about the same world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.730" end="00:04:08.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a world kind of like ours a few</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.310" end="00:04:14.549" style="s2">more dehumanized way I looked at it it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:17.190" style="s2">was a modest to moderate extrapolation</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.549" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">of current trends negative current</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.190" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">trends and assuming no reversals such as</p>

<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">and if so why write about a rule</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:31.229" style="s2">disorder so it&#39;s not quite right I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:33.240" style="s2">think that there is a thematic</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.229" end="00:04:36.449" style="s2">connection between these stories and</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.340" end="00:06:27.030" style="s2">tease this out and so what I started to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.290" end="00:06:28.740" style="s2">do was what I do as a writer I started</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.030" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">to make narratives out of these stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.740" end="00:06:32.790" style="s2">and particularly make narratives about</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">the role the technology plays in them</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.790" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">and so I wrote each of these four</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.630" style="s2">novellas individually and separately and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:40.740" style="s2">initially my publisher tor books was</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.630" end="00:06:43.169" style="s2">gonna bring out the first one</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.740" end="00:06:44.850" style="s2">unauthorised bread as a standalone book</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.169" end="00:06:46.890" style="s2">they were so excited by it actually when</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.850" end="00:06:50.100" style="s2">I sent it to them that they decided to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.890" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">launch it as a major title but with only</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.100" end="00:06:54.780" style="s2">just a few weeks planning so they were I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:56.280" style="s2">turned it in I think in June and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.780" end="00:06:58.050" style="s2">were gonna bring it out in September and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.280" end="00:06:59.400" style="s2">then I showed them the next story model</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.050" end="00:07:01.290" style="s2">minority and they&#39;re like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.400" end="00:07:02.820" style="s2">we&#39;ll do this one in October and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.290" end="00:07:04.020" style="s2">proceeded in that way and by the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.820" end="00:07:05.490" style="s2">they&#39;d seen forward them they were like</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.020" end="00:07:07.560" style="s2">no no we should stitch this together</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">into a big book and treat it like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.560" end="00:07:11.580" style="s2">novel put you out on tour with it you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:13.140" style="s2">know by that point that TV rights had</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.580" end="00:07:14.550" style="s2">been sold for an authorized bread to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.140" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">topic or the people who make the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.550" end="00:07:18.540" style="s2">intercept and you know we had a big</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:20.970" style="s2">audio book deal and lots of translation</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.540" end="00:07:22.500" style="s2">deals and so that&#39;s how it emerged as</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.970" end="00:07:24.600" style="s2">this big book and the model for that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.500" end="00:07:27.260" style="s2">I said is that different seasons book by</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.600" end="00:07:29.790" style="s2">Stephen King and this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.260" end="00:07:31.410" style="s2">thematically connecting up four novellas</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.790" end="00:07:33.180" style="s2">which are such a good form as you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.410" end="00:07:35.850" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re really fun to write in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.180" end="00:07:38.190" style="s2">you know I I like to think of as like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.850" end="00:07:39.990" style="s2">short story as being like traveling with</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.190" end="00:07:42.900" style="s2">just a carry-on bag where it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.990" end="00:07:44.640" style="s2">nothing but essentials and as a novel as</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.140" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">and so you can you can build up a whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.660" end="00:08:02.460" style="s2">complicated tale one that one that has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:04.950" style="s2">little room to ruminate and to venture</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.460" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">off the trail and show how maybe some of</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.879" end="00:08:26.969" style="s2">then the story switches and becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.340" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">very interesting tale about bread</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.170" end="00:12:17.700" style="s2">happen you have to really beta test it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.140" end="00:12:19.650" style="s2">on people who don&#39;t get to complain and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.700" end="00:12:21.990" style="s2">refugees are really the best targets for</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.650" end="00:12:23.220" style="s2">that and so the story takes place in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.990" end="00:12:24.900" style="s2">building that represents a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.220" end="00:12:26.790" style="s2">unholy alliance between property</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.900" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">developers and this kind of technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.790" end="00:12:31.770" style="s2">developer and today during the housing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:33.139" style="s2">crisis it&#39;s very common for property</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.770" end="00:12:35.480" style="s2">developers to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.139" end="00:12:36.980" style="s2">mission to build beyond what the code</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.480" end="00:12:38.600" style="s2">allows to add extra stories to a</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.600" end="00:12:42.470" style="s2">promise to build some below market rent</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.220" end="00:12:44.540" style="s2">apartments and they do this but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.470" end="00:12:46.670" style="s2">they also do everything they can to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.540" end="00:12:48.499" style="s2">it clear that they&#39;re not happy about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.670" end="00:12:50.569" style="s2">so this started with the advent of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.499" end="00:12:52.249" style="s2">things like poor doors and poor lobbies</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.569" end="00:12:54.259" style="s2">where buildings would have a separate</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.679" end="00:13:00.619" style="s2">wouldn t ever ever have to bump into</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.239" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">their poor neighbors and they would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.619" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">their own elevators with software of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:05.720" style="s2">course in my story they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:07.939" style="s2">bother with a different set of elevators</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.720" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">they can just make elevators that refuse</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:17.480" style="s2">floors who need to use them and so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.259" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">never mix the only evidence you get if</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.480" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">you live in a subsidized floor is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:23.419" style="s2">smell of good cologne when you step into</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:24.889" style="s2">the elevator that you share a building</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.419" end="00:13:26.419" style="s2">with rich people and the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.889" end="00:13:28.009" style="s2">time you&#39;re just stuck waiting 45</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.419" end="00:13:29.899" style="s2">minutes for an elevator in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.009" end="00:13:32.869" style="s2">and in the afternoon or you can take 50</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.899" end="00:13:34.609" style="s2">flights of stairs and these people live</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.869" end="00:13:36.319" style="s2">in apartments where every appliance is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.609" end="00:13:38.389" style="s2">designed to pick their pocket in every</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.389" end="00:13:41.929" style="s2">developer maximize their profits from</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.069" end="00:13:43.910" style="s2">their poorest tenants and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.929" end="00:13:46.009" style="s2">dishwasher only washes authorized dishes</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.910" end="00:13:48.529" style="s2">the toaster only toast authorized bread</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.009" end="00:13:50.389" style="s2">and the washing machines only launder</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.529" end="00:13:52.850" style="s2">authorized clothing which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.389" end="00:13:55.669" style="s2">dystopian but where it gets really scary</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.850" end="00:13:57.259" style="s2">is at the moment in which the companies</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.669" end="00:13:58.999" style="s2">that actually did these deals with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.259" end="00:14:00.379" style="s2">landlord structure themselves through</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.999" end="00:14:02.239" style="s2">bankruptcy you know they&#39;re the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.379" end="00:14:03.980" style="s2">financial engineers who dote on debt</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.239" end="00:14:05.869" style="s2">loading and periodic bankruptcies and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.980" end="00:14:07.939" style="s2">restructuring and when all the servers</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.869" end="00:14:09.919" style="s2">go down everything stops working and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.939" end="00:14:11.929" style="s2">now you have the only thing worse than</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.919" end="00:14:14.239" style="s2">these terrible appliances which is no</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.929" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">appliances at all but this ushers in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.239" end="00:14:17.899" style="s2">this kind of utopian era in which they</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:20.389" style="s2">start jailbreaking their devices and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.899" end="00:14:22.009" style="s2">realize that these appliances are</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.389" end="00:14:23.809" style="s2">perfectly good the only thing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.009" end="00:14:25.819" style="s2">them is who has control over them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.809" end="00:14:27.769" style="s2">when they seize the means of computation</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.819" end="00:14:29.779" style="s2">then they have a much better life indeed</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.769" end="00:14:31.639" style="s2">but of course that&#39;s when the story gets</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.779" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">interesting because then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.639" end="00:14:35.119" style="s2">risk that these companies are to come</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:37.819" style="s2">back that they&#39;ll catch people having</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.119" end="00:14:39.439" style="s2">jailbroken their devices that they will</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.819" end="00:14:40.669" style="s2">seek penalties under the Digital</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.669" end="00:14:44.029" style="s2">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:45.610" style="s2">real laws that are on the books now that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.029" end="00:14:46.750" style="s2">felon eyes this kind of conduct</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.610" end="00:14:48.700" style="s2">and that if you get charged with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.750" end="00:14:50.829" style="s2">felony when you&#39;re here as a refugee you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.700" end="00:14:52.510" style="s2">might face deportation to a country that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.829" end="00:14:54.459" style="s2">you left in fear of your life which</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.510" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">means that you might end up dead and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.459" end="00:14:58.450" style="s2">that&#39;s when the stakes get very high</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.720" end="00:15:01.690" style="s2">indeed it was quite an amazing story you</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.450" end="00:15:04.630" style="s2">know both the social critique but also</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.690" end="00:15:07.000" style="s2">the side of human ingenuity and the</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.000" end="00:15:11.170" style="s2">who first figured out how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.310" end="00:15:15.250" style="s2">jailbreaks and then how she spread this</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.170" end="00:15:17.560" style="s2">to the other people in the story so even</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.250" end="00:15:19.959" style="s2">you know in a dark story there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.959" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">well you know I&#39;ve often in a morbid way</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.540" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2">thought about what I would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.980" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">on my tombstone and I could think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">nothing better than this will all be so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:32.890" style="s2">great if we don&#39;t screw it up you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:35.620" style="s2">there&#39;s this story about the founding of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.890" end="00:15:37.750" style="s2">Electronic Frontier Foundation and about</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.620" end="00:15:39.640" style="s2">the so called techno utopians that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.750" end="00:15:41.470" style="s2">around in that time and the story goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.640" end="00:15:43.450" style="s2">that people like John Perry Barlow or</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:45.579" style="s2">John Gilmore thought that technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.450" end="00:15:47.200" style="s2">would automatically be amazing that you</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.200" end="00:15:50.680" style="s2">fund the ffs was that he just thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.029" end="00:15:53.649" style="s2">technology would make the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.680" end="00:15:55.510" style="s2">place and when you talk to them and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.649" end="00:15:58.570" style="s2">those folks are my mentors and I really</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.510" end="00:16:01.180" style="s2">grew up with them what you learn is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.570" end="00:16:03.370" style="s2">the reason they were so anxious to start</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.180" end="00:16:04.510" style="s2">Electronic Frontier Foundation was not</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.370" end="00:16:06.490" style="s2">because they thought things would</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.510" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">automatically be great but because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.490" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">feared how terrible things would be if</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">we didn&#39;t make them great if we didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.169" end="00:17:51.330" style="s2">the good and so it seemed for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.390" end="00:17:55.260" style="s2">while and basically the e FF generation</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.330" end="00:17:56.490" style="s2">was 12 years later in 1991-92 and so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.260" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">would give them a lot of credit for as</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.490" end="00:18:02.279" style="s2">you say not being naive techno utopia</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:04.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like we were in 1980 but seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.279" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">that there was a conflict in play where</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.500" end="00:18:09.059" style="s2">the internet could go one of two ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:12.020" style="s2">could either go to be a great benefit</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.059" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">for Humanity or maybe not so good a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.020" end="00:18:16.020" style="s2">thing for Humanity in the first reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.149" style="s2">is we&#39;ve ended up a little it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.020" end="00:18:20.490" style="s2">a bit of both yeah you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.149" end="00:18:22.620" style="s2">you look at the history of publishing on</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.490" end="00:18:24.149" style="s2">technology and on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.620" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">interdisciplinary approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.149" end="00:18:27.419" style="s2">technology where people who thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:29.100" style="s2">about what computers would be for in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.419" end="00:18:31.529" style="s2">world as opposed to just how computers</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.100" end="00:18:33.750" style="s2">could be better you get this you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.529" end="00:18:36.679" style="s2">the whole earth review and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.750" end="00:18:39.000" style="s2">earth catalogs and computer lib and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.679" end="00:18:41.010" style="s2">Yippies published computer magazine</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.000" end="00:18:43.320" style="s2">called tap and so on and you get all</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.010" end="00:18:46.049" style="s2">these people who were simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.320" end="00:18:48.299" style="s2">excited by an in terror of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.049" end="00:18:50.309" style="s2">technology could turn out and who were</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.299" end="00:18:53.669" style="s2">determined to try and steer it towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.309" end="00:18:56.130" style="s2">the good and that again described a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.669" end="00:18:59.010" style="s2">the EFS generation</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.130" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">again that was two still and we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.010" end="00:19:04.110" style="s2">mostly early adopters and then there</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">were later phase changes that happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.110" end="00:19:08.850" style="s2">business thought went mass-market</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">probably most distinctively and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.850" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">here year 2008 where Facebook became a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">thing and when the iPhone became up</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:18.750" style="s2">there this is kind of getting into what</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:20.340" style="s2">we may be talking about at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.750" end="00:19:22.950" style="s2">the talk but you know both of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.340" end="00:19:25.140" style="s2">represent a turning point not just in</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.950" end="00:19:27.030" style="s2">what technology was capable of but in</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.140" end="00:19:30.090" style="s2">what regulators were willing to tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.030" end="00:19:31.830" style="s2">and in how the story that we told</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.090" end="00:19:34.860" style="s2">ourselves about how markets work had</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.830" end="00:19:37.260" style="s2">shifted right that we went from this</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.860" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">idea of markets being a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.260" end="00:19:42.420" style="s2">should be competitive and should be</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:44.970" style="s2">constantly dynamic and where companies</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.420" end="00:19:46.860" style="s2">were being overturned and where company</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.970" end="00:19:49.140" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be allowed to use dirty tricks</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.860" end="00:19:50.730" style="s2">to fight off competitors the something</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.140" end="00:19:53.640" style="s2">that that really dated back to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.730" end="00:19:55.620" style="s2">trust-busting era to this long project</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.640" end="00:19:58.200" style="s2">that started under Ronald Reagan to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.620" end="00:20:00.390" style="s2">recast antitrust law as something whose</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.200" end="00:20:03.060" style="s2">only goal was to prevent higher prices</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.390" end="00:20:05.130" style="s2">and where everything else was fair game</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.060" end="00:20:06.930" style="s2">you know where we&#39;re buying your biggest</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.130" end="00:20:08.370" style="s2">competitors or merging with small</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.930" end="00:20:10.890" style="s2">competitors that might someday grow to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.370" end="00:20:12.300" style="s2">challenge you was fair enough as was</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.890" end="00:20:15.180" style="s2">doing things like building walled</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.300" end="00:20:17.220" style="s2">gardens around your users and telling</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.180" end="00:20:19.890" style="s2">them that they weren&#39;t allowed to hop</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.220" end="00:20:22.020" style="s2">those walls even if they thought that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.890" end="00:20:24.150" style="s2">would be in their interest to do so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.020" end="00:20:27.240" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s ironic that Apple on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.150" end="00:20:29.490" style="s2">one hand got the capital that needed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.240" end="00:20:31.220" style="s2">build the iPhone by launching the switch</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.490" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">campaign and making the iWork suite</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.220" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">where they allowed people to take</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:38.580" style="s2">documents created with Microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:40.890" style="s2">proprietary tools and bring them over to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.580" end="00:20:42.780" style="s2">a rival platform but when they then</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.890" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">built their next platform they designed</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.780" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2">it so that they could invoke the law</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">that could invoke the digital andum</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:50.010" style="s2">Copyright Act if anyone ever tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.900" style="s2">that to them you know every pirate wants</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.010" end="00:20:53.610" style="s2">to be an admiral but it&#39;s not that often</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.900" end="00:20:55.530" style="s2">that you see it being played out that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.610" end="00:20:58.590" style="s2">vividly and in such close temporal</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.530" end="00:21:00.630" style="s2">proximity yeah the the story of apples</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.590" end="00:21:03.870" style="s2">is quite an interesting one I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.630" end="00:21:07.230" style="s2">original Apple 2 was the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.870" end="00:21:08.430" style="s2">the jobs came to stand for later it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.230" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">wide open</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.430" end="00:21:14.100" style="s2">Wozniak specifically designed this multi</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:17.430" style="s2">slot bus for the first peripheral I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.100" end="00:21:20.280" style="s2">bought my first Apple two was a DC haze</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.430" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">modem which is another bit of pirate</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.280" end="00:21:23.820" style="s2">technology right at that time it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.960" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">arguable legality whether you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.820" end="00:21:26.790" style="s2">actually plug your modem into the wall</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.500" end="00:21:28.710" style="s2">but we did it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.790" end="00:21:30.990" style="s2">and it worked I mean it&#39;s even more than</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.710" end="00:21:32.820" style="s2">that so on the one hand you have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.990" end="00:21:34.590" style="s2">this idea that AT&amp;T said that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.820" end="00:21:36.420" style="s2">should alone be able to determine what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.590" end="00:21:38.190" style="s2">you could plug into your wall and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.420" end="00:21:39.960" style="s2">see famous court cases about this like</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.190" end="00:21:42.059" style="s2">Costra phone and Carter phone and so on</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.960" end="00:21:43.500" style="s2">but on the other hand Hayes then got</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.059" end="00:21:45.929" style="s2">furious that people started making</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.500" end="00:21:47.850" style="s2">compatible Hayes modems that use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.929" end="00:21:50.490" style="s2">same command set the eighty command set</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.850" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">so you know over and over again you see</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.490" end="00:21:56.160" style="s2">the people who who gained prominence by</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">running roughshod over someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.160" end="00:22:00.690" style="s2">exclusive turf then declaring the turf</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.470" end="00:22:02.550" style="s2">that they&#39;ve created to be their own and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.690" end="00:22:04.679" style="s2">theirs alone and you know this is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.550" end="00:22:07.260" style="s2">new right like the people who came up</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.679" end="00:22:09.750" style="s2">with the first sound recordings the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.260" end="00:22:11.970" style="s2">piano rolls were accused by composers of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.750" end="00:22:13.500" style="s2">being pirates John Philip Sousa said if</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.970" end="00:22:15.300" style="s2">the infernal talking machines are</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.500" end="00:22:17.040" style="s2">allowed to continue we will lose our</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.300" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">voices as we came down out of the trees</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.040" end="00:22:21.780" style="s2">but then as phonograms gained prominence</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:24.030" style="s2">and broadcasters came along and started</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.780" end="00:22:25.140" style="s2">playing records without permission they</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.030" end="00:22:27.270" style="s2">turned around and they said you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.140" end="00:22:29.160" style="s2">when we stole those compositions and put</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.270" end="00:22:31.500" style="s2">them on records that was legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.160" end="00:22:33.420" style="s2">technological progress but you playing</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.500" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">those records on the radio is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.420" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">piracy and then when the broadcaster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:39.480" style="s2">confronted the cable operators who were</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:40.860" style="s2">sucking in signals and retransmitting</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.480" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">them without permission they said when</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.860" end="00:22:44.429" style="s2">we stole the set records to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:45.750" style="s2">broadcast signals that was legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.429" end="00:22:47.309" style="s2">progress but when you steal the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.750" end="00:22:48.900" style="s2">broadcast signals to put them on cable</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.309" end="00:22:50.760" style="s2">that&#39;s piracy and then the cable</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.900" end="00:22:53.370" style="s2">operators say the same thing to the VCR</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.760" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">makers and then the VCR makers Sony turn</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.370" end="00:22:58.830" style="s2">around and said this to Napster right</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:00.750" style="s2">and what changes is not this impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.830" end="00:23:02.760" style="s2">defend the thing that you did as unique</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.750" end="00:23:04.110" style="s2">precious and worthy of defense and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.760" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">thing that someone else did with what</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.110" end="00:23:09.270" style="s2">you made as being piracy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">illegitimate what changed is 40 years of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">reaganomics that made the winners of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:15.340" style="s2">last year&#39;s lotteries into someone who</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:17.110" style="s2">lawmakers and regularly</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.340" end="00:23:19.870" style="s2">were prepared to accept as the only</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.870" end="00:23:23.290" style="s2">years to come</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:25.830" style="s2">you added that the fact that the low</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.290" end="00:23:28.870" style="s2">friction environments of our network</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.830" end="00:23:31.000" style="s2">businesses appear to collapse to one or</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.870" end="00:23:33.040" style="s2">two winners even more so than the</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.320" end="00:23:40.090" style="s2">now end up in a position where it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.270" end="00:23:41.590" style="s2">to see how we get out you know I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.090" end="00:23:43.300" style="s2">gonna quibble with you here I have heard</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.300" end="00:23:47.860" style="s2">low friction and global markets and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:49.540" style="s2">first mover advantage and these are all</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.860" end="00:23:51.280" style="s2">definitely forces that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.540" end="00:23:53.770" style="s2">reckoned with in competition policy but</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.280" end="00:23:56.110" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing until Ronald Reagan</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.770" end="00:23:58.630" style="s2">gutted antitrust law companies were not</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.110" end="00:24:00.760" style="s2">allowed to grow through vertical mergers</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.630" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">or mergers to monopoly horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.760" end="00:24:05.350" style="s2">mergers and they weren&#39;t allowed to they</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:06.670" style="s2">were bound by things like structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.350" end="00:24:08.020" style="s2">separation where they weren&#39;t allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.670" end="00:24:09.940" style="s2">compete with the companies that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.020" end="00:24:11.890" style="s2">enabled so banks couldn&#39;t own businesses</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.940" end="00:24:14.230" style="s2">phone companies couldn&#39;t own data</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.890" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">processing services and so on and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.230" end="00:24:17.590" style="s2">took away those protections and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.940" end="00:24:19.150" style="s2">ironically we took away those</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.590" end="00:24:21.040" style="s2">protections and the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.150" end="00:24:23.230" style="s2">arguing for deregulation at the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.040" end="00:24:25.000" style="s2">said well deregulation will be fine</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.230" end="00:24:27.190" style="s2">because we have these other antitrust</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.000" end="00:24:29.860" style="s2">protections that will protect us from</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.190" end="00:24:31.900" style="s2">the worst effects of deregulation and at</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.860" end="00:24:33.490" style="s2">the same time their colleagues were</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.900" end="00:24:35.350" style="s2">going around and taking away the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.490" end="00:24:37.090" style="s2">antitrust protections too so we lost</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.350" end="00:24:38.890" style="s2">both we lost the brake in the emergency</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.090" end="00:24:40.900" style="s2">brake and when you look back on the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.890" end="00:24:42.520" style="s2">40 years and contemplate how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.900" end="00:24:45.460" style="s2">we ended up with duopoly x&#39; in most</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.520" end="00:24:48.130" style="s2">telecoms markets and quad awfully and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.460" end="00:24:49.750" style="s2">publishing and in online services and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.130" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">on you don&#39;t see that these companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.750" end="00:24:54.190" style="s2">grew because of identifiable benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:55.480" style="s2">network effects or low friction you see</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.190" end="00:24:57.670" style="s2">that they grew by buying all their</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.480" end="00:25:00.070" style="s2">competitors right and then doing really</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.670" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">anti-competitive stuff right Google&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.070" end="00:25:04.540" style="s2">only ever had two products that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:06.310" style="s2">made inside they made mail and search</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.540" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">and everything else they do they bought</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.310" end="00:25:11.110" style="s2">right and and you know Bill Gates just</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">described his greatest regret as not</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.110" end="00:25:14.230" style="s2">buying Android for Microsoft when it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:17.380" style="s2">on the open market</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.230" end="00:25:19.900" style="s2">so these companies did not grow by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.380" end="00:25:22.420" style="s2">ineffable and uncountable effects of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.900" end="00:25:25.030" style="s2">networks they grew like Facebook did</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.420" end="00:25:26.500" style="s2">they grew by putting spyware on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.030" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">phones right Facebook bought a company</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.500" end="00:25:29.770" style="s2">called inaho</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.300" style="s2">that made a fake battery monitor it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.770" end="00:25:33.040" style="s2">would monitor your battery but mostly</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.300" end="00:25:35.650" style="s2">what it did was monitor your whole phone</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.040" end="00:25:37.390" style="s2">and send Facebook intimate detailed</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.650" end="00:25:39.970" style="s2">prospectus &#39;as of how you used your</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.390" end="00:25:42.130" style="s2">phone and on that basis Facebook figured</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.970" end="00:25:43.690" style="s2">out which companies to buy and how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.130" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">compete with the ones that they hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.690" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">bought right and that stuff that would</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.220" end="00:25:49.090" style="s2">have been banned under a pre Reagan</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:50.920" style="s2">theories of antitrust so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.090" end="00:25:52.090" style="s2">just seems to me that if you have a set</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.920" end="00:25:53.980" style="s2">of rules that prohibit a set of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.090" end="00:25:55.390" style="s2">activities to prevent certain outcome</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.980" end="00:25:57.070" style="s2">and you take away the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.390" end="00:25:59.050" style="s2">companies engage in those activities and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.070" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">you get that outcome that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.050" end="00:26:03.430" style="s2">unreasonable to say maybe the rules were</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:05.680" style="s2">working and maybe it&#39;s not some mystical</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.430" end="00:26:07.450" style="s2">force to do with low friction that did</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.680" end="00:26:09.700" style="s2">it otherwise you know how is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.450" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">ended up with one major I where company</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.700" end="00:26:13.000" style="s2">that owns every eyewear brand you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:15.010" style="s2">ever heard of and one major</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.000" end="00:26:17.800" style="s2">pro-wrestling company that is the last</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.010" end="00:26:19.600" style="s2">one standing from where we once had 22</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.800" end="00:26:21.310" style="s2">is it very low friction that enabled</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:23.110" style="s2">that kind of monopolist &#39;im or is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.310" end="00:26:25.150" style="s2">exactly the same forces that enabled</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.110" end="00:26:27.850" style="s2">monopolist amande tech I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.150" end="00:26:30.730" style="s2">two different things here it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.850" end="00:26:33.070" style="s2">interesting distinction first I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.730" end="00:26:35.310" style="s2">argue that the low frequency increasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.070" end="00:26:39.460" style="s2">returns to scale models are with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.310" end="00:26:41.710" style="s2">Google search and Facebook dock platform</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.460" end="00:26:45.400" style="s2">the first one that actually did this was</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.710" end="00:26:47.800" style="s2">eBay to collapse to a single winner then</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.400" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">they leveraged the single winner to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.800" end="00:26:52.090" style="s2">accrete ancillary products as you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.350" style="s2">Google has only built a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.090" end="00:26:55.300" style="s2">products it hasn&#39;t done a very good job</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.350" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">of managing very many of the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.300" end="00:26:59.770" style="s2">with a few exceptions but nonetheless is</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:02.050" style="s2">thrown up against the wall and had a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.770" end="00:27:03.700" style="s2">big winners that stopped such as YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.050" end="00:27:06.220" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been able to leverage the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.700" end="00:27:08.050" style="s2">the one true Network effect business to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.220" end="00:27:09.850" style="s2">take the cash flows from that to build</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.050" end="00:27:12.550" style="s2">out for as automated capture market</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.850" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">share Facebook has played so far some a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.550" end="00:27:17.980" style="s2">different play which is again once they</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">reached a tipping point versus the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.980" end="00:27:22.660" style="s2">earlier social media companies there was</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">a very rapid take off of the 2007 to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.660" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">2010 period where Facebook platform was</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:33.190" style="s2">opposed to the company dip down the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">network effect business is I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.190" end="00:27:38.110" style="s2">classic as an example of Metcalfe&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:40.180" style="s2">as more of our friends got on just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.110" end="00:27:41.920" style="s2">the fax machines in the late 80s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.180" end="00:27:44.230" style="s2">more we wanted to get out and once</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.920" end="00:27:46.300" style="s2">everybody&#39;s on relatively difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.230" end="00:27:48.730" style="s2">people to back off then Facebook it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.300" end="00:27:52.330" style="s2">something a little different than Google</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:55.140" style="s2">which is it started buying other network</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.330" end="00:27:58.660" style="s2">effect businesses it bought Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.140" end="00:28:01.180" style="s2">which was a potential my exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.660" end="00:28:03.910" style="s2">competitor but partial substitute and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.180" end="00:28:06.520" style="s2">then it leads you know a ways away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.910" end="00:28:09.250" style="s2">its core business to buy what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.520" end="00:28:11.470" style="s2">which relatively unknown to people the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.250" end="00:28:13.990" style="s2">United States was building a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.470" end="00:28:16.210" style="s2">country-by-country Network effects and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.990" end="00:28:18.070" style="s2">so I would say that Facebook is a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.210" end="00:28:21.040" style="s2">different strategy but both of them and</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.070" end="00:28:23.050" style="s2">network effects in there for businesses</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.040" end="00:28:24.490" style="s2">say that accreted on to other things</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.050" end="00:28:26.770" style="s2">then two together are particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.490" end="00:28:28.330" style="s2">dangerous because these network effect</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.770" end="00:28:31.780" style="s2">businesses are so outrageously</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.330" end="00:28:35.560" style="s2">profitable they can allow very long term</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.780" end="00:28:37.180" style="s2">subsidization of other products in a way</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.560" end="00:28:38.470" style="s2">to make competition essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.180" end="00:28:40.450" style="s2">impossible would you like to try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.470" end="00:28:43.000" style="s2">compete whatsapp for instance with</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.450" end="00:28:45.220" style="s2">Facebook being behind it essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.000" end="00:28:46.780" style="s2">impossible well let me take a shot at</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.220" end="00:28:48.970" style="s2">how you would compete with them so when</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.780" end="00:28:50.470" style="s2">Facebook launched it had exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.970" end="00:28:52.270" style="s2">same problem that a potential Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.470" end="00:28:54.040" style="s2">competitor would have today which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.270" end="00:28:56.170" style="s2">that everyone who you&#39;d want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.040" end="00:28:58.570" style="s2">on Facebook was already on MySpace and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.170" end="00:29:00.850" style="s2">the way that Facebook dealt with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.570" end="00:29:02.110" style="s2">network effect problem was by flipping</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.850" end="00:29:03.910" style="s2">it on its head using something called</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.110" end="00:29:05.950" style="s2">adversarial interoperability which</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.910" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">brings us back to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.950" end="00:29:09.850" style="s2">unauthorized bread and adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:11.620" style="s2">interoperability is when a new market</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.850" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">entrance comes up with a way to plug</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.620" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">something into an existing market</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">entrance product without that existing</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:20.380" style="s2">market entrance permission so this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:23.350" style="s2">like third parties who made terminals</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.380" end="00:29:25.870" style="s2">and printers for the IBM 360 or third</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.350" end="00:29:28.510" style="s2">parties who made modems for 18 T&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.870" end="00:29:29.980" style="s2">networks or in Facebook&#39;s case they made</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.510" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">a tool that would log into my space</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">yeah I mean you know a good example</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:08.470" style="s2">would be car engines right so these days</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:10.330" style="s2">many auto manufacturers use</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.470" end="00:32:12.580" style="s2">cryptographic handshaking so that when</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.330" end="00:32:15.100" style="s2">you put a new part in a car engine it</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.580" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">won&#39;t work until an authorized service</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.100" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">technician unlocks that part using an</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:20.560" style="s2">unlock code this is something Apple does</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:23.140" style="s2">with some of its parts for its phones</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.560" end="00:32:25.060" style="s2">and so on and you know they also have</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.140" end="00:32:27.340" style="s2">this diagnostic tool that reads back</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.060" end="00:32:28.990" style="s2">these codes and the cost of goods for</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:31.180" style="s2">that diagnostic tool is like under a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.990" end="00:32:33.160" style="s2">hundred bucks and they charge thousands</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.180" end="00:32:35.050" style="s2">of dollars for it and so we have a tool</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.160" end="00:32:37.270" style="s2">that cost thousands of dollars to buy</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.050" end="00:32:38.830" style="s2">but a couple hundred bucks to make you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.270" end="00:32:41.350" style="s2">would expect that competitors would rush</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.830" end="00:32:42.970" style="s2">in and lower the cost and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.350" end="00:32:45.250" style="s2">that because you have to bypass a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.970" end="00:32:46.570" style="s2">copyright protection in order to do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.250" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">even though car parts that themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.570" end="00:32:52.330" style="s2">are not copyrightable the software that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:54.100" style="s2">protects them is and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.330" end="00:32:56.050" style="s2">bypass the copyright protection on it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.100" end="00:32:57.940" style="s2">you violate section 12 one and the</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:02.470" style="s2">we cut off the cycle the cycle by which</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.130" end="00:33:05.140" style="s2">new entrants challenge old entrants</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:07.420" style="s2">using new techniques that Gore the old</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.140" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">entrance auks right that take their high</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.420" end="00:33:11.170" style="s2">margin business and reduce it to a low</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:13.540" style="s2">margin business and find some new high</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.170" end="00:33:15.280" style="s2">margin business that comes up to find a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.540" end="00:33:17.080" style="s2">new industry that eventually becomes low</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:19.480" style="s2">margin and that drives innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.080" end="00:33:21.610" style="s2">competition instead what you get is this</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.480" end="00:33:23.680" style="s2">ability to just sit pat right to make a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.610" end="00:33:25.510" style="s2">thing and block other people from</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.680" end="00:33:27.730" style="s2">entering the market which is how you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.510" end="00:33:29.350" style="s2">have for example insulin going up a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.730" end="00:33:31.900" style="s2">thousand percent in ten years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:33.940" style="s2">particularly Humalog insulin going up a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.900" end="00:33:37.300" style="s2">thousand percent in ten years with no</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.300" end="00:33:41.230" style="s2">being filed just pure anti-competitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.100" end="00:33:43.480" style="s2">measures that stop other people from</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.230" end="00:33:45.040" style="s2">entering the market that allows for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.480" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">product to become more expensive not</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.040" end="00:33:50.290" style="s2">less over time that is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:52.120" style="s2">one not obvious to me how they</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.290" end="00:33:53.620" style="s2">accomplish that which type of insulin</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.120" end="00:33:54.509" style="s2">because not that part of the business to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.620" end="00:33:56.279" style="s2">enter and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.509" end="00:33:58.739" style="s2">so clearly in the public domain at this</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.279" end="00:34:00.919" style="s2">point yeah I don&#39;t know any of the facts</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.739" end="00:34:02.969" style="s2">do you have to know any facts how they</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.919" end="00:34:03.389" style="s2">writers has got a really good piece on</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.969" end="00:34:05.070" style="s2">this today</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.389" end="00:34:07.529" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a few things so one is</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.070" end="00:34:09.480" style="s2">that they actually do have some new</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.529" end="00:34:12.539" style="s2">patents but the new patents are on</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.480" end="00:34:15.480" style="s2">ancillary processes that they used to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.539" end="00:34:17.879" style="s2">chase off other potential sellers one is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.480" end="00:34:19.379" style="s2">that they have a history of buying up so</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.879" end="00:34:20.759" style="s2">this is mostly Eli Lilly they have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.379" end="00:34:22.740" style="s2">history of buying up generics</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.759" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">manufacturers that might make generic</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.740" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">insulin or paying generics manufacturers</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:29.250" style="s2">not to make generic insulin so when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">when you try to enter the market they</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:33.990" style="s2">just offer you some money not to do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:36.119" style="s2">they also use lawsuits under exotic</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.990" end="00:34:38.149" style="s2">legal theories to just scare off</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.119" end="00:34:40.169" style="s2">potential new entrants to the market and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.149" end="00:34:42.119" style="s2">then they&#39;ve got a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.169" end="00:34:45.029" style="s2">delivery systems that are themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.119" end="00:34:46.589" style="s2">patented right effectively like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.029" end="00:34:48.569" style="s2">equivalent of a printer that takes a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.589" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">special printer ink cartridge and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.569" end="00:34:53.250" style="s2">they&#39;ve spent a lot of money marketing</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:55.319" style="s2">to doctors to only prescribe these new</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.250" end="00:34:56.759" style="s2">delivery systems and so that allows them</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:07.500" style="s2">less and you know there are caravans now</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.100" end="00:36:35.060" style="s2">pissed off right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:36.740" style="s2">at John Deere because traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.060" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">farmers work on the ring stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.740" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">mostly you can&#39;t work on a new John</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:43.670" style="s2">any ideas on how this could be finished</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.150" end="00:36:45.250" style="s2">in the world work products are by their</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.670" end="00:36:47.150" style="s2">means we&#39;re going to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.250" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">proprietary intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.150" end="00:36:52.460" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting nuance here and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:54.290" style="s2">John Deere is a good example of it it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.460" end="00:36:56.120" style="s2">actually not hard to fix your own John</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.290" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">Deere tractor it&#39;s just illegal right</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.120" end="00:36:59.810" style="s2">when you call out a John Deere</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:02.030" style="s2">technician they read the same error</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.810" end="00:37:04.280" style="s2">codes out of the engine that you read</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.030" end="00:37:05.960" style="s2">they take the same part that you buy</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.280" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">from John Deere and they put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.960" end="00:37:10.460" style="s2">engine and the only difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:12.650" style="s2">they enter an unlock code and for that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.460" end="00:37:14.180" style="s2">you pay hundreds of dollars and have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.650" end="00:37:15.500" style="s2">wait a day which means you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.180" end="00:37:17.690" style="s2">hay while the Sun shines which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.500" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">reliably informed is a bedrock of good</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.690" end="00:37:22.460" style="s2">agricultural practice and so the change</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:23.960" style="s2">that we need to make here is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.460" end="00:37:25.730" style="s2">pretty straightforward there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.960" end="00:37:28.070" style="s2">lot of legislation so-called right to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.730" end="00:37:29.570" style="s2">repair legislation that says that John</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.070" end="00:37:31.130" style="s2">Deere would have to provide these unlock</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.570" end="00:37:32.810" style="s2">codes and that&#39;s fair enough and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.130" end="00:37:34.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to do it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.810" end="00:37:36.740" style="s2">there are there are a bunch of even</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.310" end="00:37:38.360" style="s2">simpler bedrock rules that we could make</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:40.310" style="s2">that would make things simpler so for</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.360" end="00:37:42.410" style="s2">example we could say that the Digital</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.310" end="00:37:44.090" style="s2">Millennium Copyright Act only prohibits</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.410" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">circumvention for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.090" end="00:37:48.170" style="s2">copyright infringement so unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:51.290" style="s2">infringing copyright you can break</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.170" end="00:37:53.180" style="s2">copyright blocks if you are wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.290" end="00:37:55.820" style="s2">so a good example was we just wanted to</p>

<p begin="00:53:15.950" end="00:53:20.840" style="s2">the people you love but on an insult for</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.260" end="00:53:22.460" style="s2">the only people left behind are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.840" end="00:53:25.370" style="s2">people who can&#39;t figure it out the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.460" end="00:53:28.040" style="s2">people who find love they leave and she</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.370" end="00:53:30.410" style="s2">realized she was the only one who wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.040" end="00:53:32.450" style="s2">so pathological that she was incapable</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.410" end="00:53:34.250" style="s2">of ever finding love and that the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.450" end="00:53:36.140" style="s2">other people who stuck around were the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.250" end="00:53:38.570" style="s2">people who were that pathological that</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.140" end="00:53:40.760" style="s2">broken and that instead of telling</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.570" end="00:53:42.740" style="s2">people it gets better they were there to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.760" end="00:53:44.630" style="s2">tell people it gets worse and that it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.740" end="00:53:46.790" style="s2">was a form of self-fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.630" end="00:53:48.860" style="s2">and when I heard this interview it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.790" end="00:53:51.230" style="s2">reminded me of a study I&#39;d read by</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.860" end="00:53:53.630" style="s2">Boston University psych professor who</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.230" end="00:53:55.070" style="s2">was investigating suicide bombers case</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.630" end="00:53:56.810" style="s2">histories of suicide bombers in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.070" end="00:53:58.820" style="s2">occupied territory in the West Bank and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.810" end="00:54:00.890" style="s2">he found that the biggest predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.820" end="00:54:03.650" style="s2">someone being a suicide bomber was not</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.890" end="00:54:05.600" style="s2">their commitment to radical ideology but</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.650" end="00:54:08.390" style="s2">suicidal depression right that being</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.600" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">suicidal made you commit suicide</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.390" end="00:54:12.890" style="s2">bombings and more to the point being</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:14.270" style="s2">suicidal made you someone who someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.890" end="00:54:16.190" style="s2">could come and whisper in your ear and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.270" end="00:54:17.240" style="s2">say if you&#39;re gonna do it anyway don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.190" end="00:54:19.100" style="s2">let it go to waste</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.240" end="00:54:21.740" style="s2">and that really the origin of suicide</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.100" end="00:54:23.780" style="s2">bombing attacks was not ideology but</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.740" end="00:54:26.660" style="s2">trauma the trauma that made people</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.780" end="00:54:28.010" style="s2">vulnerable to ideologues and so when I</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.660" end="00:54:29.960" style="s2">put these things together I said to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.010" end="00:54:31.970" style="s2">myself what would happen if respectable</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.960" end="00:54:33.530" style="s2">middle-class white dudes rather than</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.530" end="00:54:36.560" style="s2">they got frustrated or going and</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.560" end="00:54:40.850" style="s2">started to kill healthcare executives</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.610" style="s2">who doom the people that they loved to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.850" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">slow painful deaths because they denied</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:48.860" style="s2">the near future that is the thing from</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.000" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">today people in America who are insured</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.860" end="00:54:53.000" style="s2">die slow painful deaths because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:55.160" style="s2">denied coverage by the insurers that</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.160" end="00:54:59.930" style="s2">would happen in our body politic if</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.800" end="00:55:01.790" style="s2">suddenly the suicide bombers who were</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.930" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">blowing up the wealthiest people in the</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.060" end="00:55:12.710" style="s2">were not people who embraced Islam or</p>

<p begin="00:55:12.710" end="00:55:17.720" style="s2">were white people who respectable in</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.320" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">middle class and male how long would it</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.720" end="00:55:21.380" style="s2">take us before we started calling them</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:22.970" style="s2">terrorists and what would their lives be</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.380" end="00:55:24.950" style="s2">like and so that&#39;s how that story came</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.970" end="00:55:27.290" style="s2">about it was very wrenching to write I</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.950" end="00:55:29.150" style="s2">have lost loved ones to cancer it is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.290" end="00:55:30.680" style="s2">wrenching read I when I went on tour</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.150" end="00:55:32.990" style="s2">with a book tried reading from that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.680" end="00:55:35.090" style="s2">story and I found I couldn&#39;t do it it</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.990" end="00:55:37.580" style="s2">was just too much it was extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.090" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">powerful I mean you got some of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.580" end="00:55:43.970" style="s2">testimony from the people on that board</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:46.850" style="s2">was just as wrenching as it can get but</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.970" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">you also explored as you describe the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.850" end="00:55:52.310" style="s2">concept of what happens in certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.990" style="s2">of echo chambers and filter bubbles this</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.310" end="00:55:56.270" style="s2">was an extreme case and they do say</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.990" end="00:55:59.480" style="s2">particularly because of the filter</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.270" end="00:56:01.820" style="s2">dynamics the boosts radicalized become</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.480" end="00:56:03.890" style="s2">community leaders who you&#39;re also trying</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.820" end="00:56:07.460" style="s2">to say anything more general about</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.890" end="00:56:09.260" style="s2">intense echo chambers filter balls well</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.460" end="00:56:12.050" style="s2">really what I wanted to do was counter</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.260" end="00:56:14.570" style="s2">the contagion theory of radicalization</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.050" end="00:56:17.000" style="s2">and replace it with the trauma theory of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.570" end="00:56:19.010" style="s2">radicalization so I think that we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.000" end="00:56:21.980" style="s2">very confused about the causal</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.010" end="00:56:23.900" style="s2">relationship in toxic online activity</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.980" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">today whether that&#39;s conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.900" end="00:56:28.490" style="s2">or radicalization that you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.540" end="00:56:31.100" style="s2">these um you might call them idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.490" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">explanations right why do people believe</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.100" end="00:56:35.510" style="s2">in anti VAX well because the ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:37.490" style="s2">rubbed up against them and they got the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.510" end="00:56:39.830" style="s2">ideas they were contaminated by them</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.490" end="00:56:42.170" style="s2">they got the contagion of bad ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.830" end="00:56:44.300" style="s2">you know anti-vaxxers been around for a</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.170" end="00:56:46.250" style="s2">really really long time you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.300" end="00:56:48.950" style="s2">same anti-vaxxer arguments that are made</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.250" end="00:56:51.230" style="s2">today being made in the 20s being made</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.950" end="00:56:53.810" style="s2">about the Salk vaccine and an</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.230" end="00:56:57.380" style="s2">ideological account of the rise of anti</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.810" end="00:56:58.820" style="s2">VAX somehow would have to say that the</p>

<p begin="00:56:58.820" end="00:57:04.010" style="s2">anti-vaxxers are better more convincing</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.700" end="00:57:05.900" style="s2">than the arguments that were made by</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.010" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">their predecessors when anti backs was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.900" end="00:57:11.780" style="s2">fringe phenomenon and instead I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:14.090" style="s2">that the rise of anti VAX is about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.780" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">trauma of not being able to trust the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.090" end="00:57:17.480" style="s2">regulatory process anymore you know I</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:19.010" style="s2">think that it&#39;s not an accident for</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.480" end="00:57:21.829" style="s2">example that antibiotics gained currency</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.010" end="00:57:23.150" style="s2">at the same time as the opioid epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.829" end="00:57:26.539" style="s2">taking off because the opioid epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.150" end="00:57:29.170" style="s2">is what the anti-vaccine Spira C theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.539" end="00:57:32.089" style="s2">says is going on the opioid epidemic is</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.579" end="01:00:58.140" style="s2">facts is wrong but opioid denial is</p>

<p begin="01:01:55.180" end="01:01:58.630" style="s2">and then you need the statistical</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.790" end="01:02:11.410" style="s2">virology and so on to assess the actual</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.220" end="01:02:12.850" style="s2">substance of the paper so you can become</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.410" end="01:02:14.380" style="s2">media literate maybe you can become</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.850" end="01:02:16.090" style="s2">statistically literate I think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.380" end="01:02:17.590" style="s2">would be great if we did we need much</p>

<p begin="01:04:00.490" end="01:04:06.520" style="s2">eliminate conspiracies yeah though I did</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.150" end="01:04:09.130" style="s2">see something interesting this morning</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.520" end="01:04:10.630" style="s2">actually this week&#39;s economist said Mike</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.130" end="01:04:14.020" style="s2">pointed something a little different</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.630" end="01:04:16.870" style="s2">they did an analysis on VAX versus</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.020" end="01:04:19.840" style="s2">anti-vaxxer sentiment around the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.870" end="01:04:21.010" style="s2">and somewhat surprised me I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.840" end="01:04:23.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t have anything special Jay</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.010" end="01:04:26.770" style="s2">surprising but I thought it interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.470" end="01:04:28.780" style="s2">that the highest flow of anti-vaxxer</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.770" end="01:04:30.580" style="s2">sentiment in the world is in Western</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.780" end="01:04:33.270" style="s2">Europe the lowest</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.580" end="01:04:35.980" style="s2">anti-vaxxer sentiment is in South Asia</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.270" end="01:04:38.590" style="s2">and we think about who is living under</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.980" end="01:04:40.480" style="s2">the most trauma in their everyday life</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.590" end="01:04:42.190" style="s2">it would seem to me pretty clear that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.480" end="01:04:45.100" style="s2">people who live in South Asia are</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.190" end="01:04:47.140" style="s2">confronting trauma on a daily basis at a</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.100" end="01:04:49.570" style="s2">level those of us who lived in the rich</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.140" end="01:04:51.640" style="s2">West couldn&#39;t even imagine well if</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.570" end="01:04:54.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a place where that&#39;s the least</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.640" end="01:04:55.000" style="s2">true it&#39;s probably in Western Europe and</p>

<p begin="01:04:55.000" end="01:04:59.260" style="s2">I&#39;d love to know the ethnography of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:01.060" style="s2">you know I can make up stories about why</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.260" end="01:05:03.150" style="s2">it&#39;s true but they&#39;re untested but like</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.060" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">for example I know that in Europe the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.150" end="01:05:07.840" style="s2">anti-vaxxers closely associated with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:10.860" style="s2">green movement for a long time and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.840" end="01:05:14.170" style="s2">represented a wider skepticism about</p>

<p begin="01:07:14.470" end="01:07:18.600" style="s2">and you know this one really rang home</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.360" end="01:07:20.620" style="s2">for me I&#39;ll confess to have had</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.600" end="01:07:23.470" style="s2">survivalist tendencies on and off</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.620" end="01:07:26.100" style="s2">probably originally in about 1989 when I</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.470" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">happen my wife and I bought a rural</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.100" end="01:07:33.460" style="s2">property three hours from DC of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:35.230" style="s2">country farm basically and I said hmm we</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.460" end="01:07:37.330" style="s2">bought it mostly for recreation place to</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.230" end="01:07:39.430" style="s2">get away you know live a little bit on</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.330" end="01:07:42.430" style="s2">the light closer to the land etc then</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.430" end="01:07:44.410" style="s2">then life in suburbia I said what this</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.430" end="01:07:47.800" style="s2">also have utility as a survivalist</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.410" end="01:07:50.110" style="s2">refuge and at the time I said how</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.800" end="01:07:52.510" style="s2">curiously should I take that and I came</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.110" end="01:07:56.550" style="s2">up with through a pseudo-scientific</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.510" end="01:07:59.320" style="s2">process of 2% chance that I would see a</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.550" end="01:08:04.950" style="s2">serious social collapse in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.320" end="01:08:06.990" style="s2">at the time I was in my late 30s and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.950" end="01:08:09.150" style="s2">pher long life expectancy figure 2%</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.990" end="01:08:10.710" style="s2">chance i reran those numbers not too</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.150" end="01:08:13.890" style="s2">many years ago a couple years ago and</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.710" end="01:08:17.040" style="s2">came up with 20% chance with a much</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.890" end="01:08:19.200" style="s2">shorter life expectancy so one might say</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.040" end="01:08:21.330" style="s2">I think part of that is I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.200" end="01:08:26.160" style="s2">more about what could cause the social</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.330" end="01:08:29.120" style="s2">collapse for instance there&#39;s the famous</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.160" end="01:08:31.620" style="s2">Carrington effect solar storm that</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.120" end="01:08:36.270" style="s2">fortunately hit right before the age of</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.620" end="01:08:39.540" style="s2">electricity solar storm of 1859 and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.270" end="01:08:42.330" style="s2">of course our society seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.540" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">got more unstable the last 30 years and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.330" end="01:08:47.489" style="s2">hence I give a non-trivial chance 20</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:52.410" style="s2">percent might in the next 20 years call</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.489" end="01:08:55.589" style="s2">it that we could have a collapse and my</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.410" end="01:08:57.049" style="s2">second personal reaction is as you will</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.589" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">tell us when you tell us about the story</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.049" end="01:09:03.779" style="s2">your scenario is basically the bunker</p>

<p begin="01:09:08.219" end="01:09:12.839" style="s2">will say I never have taken that very</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.469" end="01:09:14.870" style="s2">seriously personally and they thought</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.839" end="01:09:17.489" style="s2">that if one does want to think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.870" end="01:09:19.830" style="s2">survivalism you&#39;re much better to take a</p>

<p begin="01:09:19.830" end="01:09:24.810" style="s2">that has an intact community of people</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.630" end="01:09:26.670" style="s2">who have old-timey skills where the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.810" end="01:09:28.500" style="s2">population density is low or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.670" end="01:09:31.620" style="s2">plenty of water where the climate is</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.500" end="01:09:34.049" style="s2">tolerable and be a good citizen in those</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.620" end="01:09:37.130" style="s2">communities and make your bet that those</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.049" end="01:09:39.750" style="s2">communities will survive rather than</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.750" end="01:09:44.759" style="s2">likely to survive so anyway that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.230" end="01:09:47.880" style="s2">personal reaction to thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.759" end="01:09:49.440" style="s2">story tell us some more this was really</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.880" end="01:09:52.319" style="s2">a response to some of that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.440" end="01:09:55.170" style="s2">thinking and in particular to the rise</p>

<p begin="01:10:01.560" end="01:10:06.390" style="s2">so on and it was the idea that</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.390" end="01:10:14.060" style="s2">are not the kind of thing where you can</p>

<p begin="01:10:14.060" end="01:10:18.110" style="s2">we hear a lot of rhetoric about whether</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.059" end="01:14:47.829" style="s2">someone has to think about you know what</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.829" end="01:14:51.219" style="s2">scenarios and for what period of a dip</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.829" end="01:14:54.579" style="s2">are you planning for and at what level</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.219" end="01:14:57.369" style="s2">can you bring society back to relatively</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.579" end="01:15:00.369" style="s2">quickly and you know I am of the view</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.369" end="01:15:03.929" style="s2">that under a strong enough Cataclysm</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.369" end="01:15:08.050" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a biological terror or a</p>

<p begin="01:15:08.050" end="01:15:12.210" style="s2">we could get a pretty broken back</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.210" end="01:15:16.659" style="s2">billions of people could die and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.289" end="01:15:18.940" style="s2">would be horrendously ugly the question</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.659" end="01:15:22.050" style="s2">is can that collapse be stopped and</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.940" end="01:15:24.699" style="s2">brought back to a sustainable level and</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.539" end="01:15:36.699" style="s2">we know what we know on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.579" end="01:15:39.820" style="s2">our technology stacks are extremely deep</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.699" end="01:15:42.400" style="s2">for instance micro processors require a</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.820" end="01:15:45.190" style="s2">layer of about 15 different very</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.400" end="01:15:48.460" style="s2">advanced technologies many of which have</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.190" end="01:15:51.190" style="s2">very deep material Sciences requirements</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.460" end="01:15:54.219" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of hard to think about</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.190" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">how you&#39;d reboot on the other hand if</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.219" end="01:15:59.650" style="s2">you look some of the folks I&#39;ve chatted</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:01.920" style="s2">with I have looked at a period at</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.650" end="01:16:05.139" style="s2">nineteen twenty five or there abouts</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.920" end="01:16:08.170" style="s2">where we had internal combustion engines</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.139" end="01:16:10.869" style="s2">we had the beginnings of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.170" end="01:16:13.179" style="s2">industrial world etc there&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.869" end="01:16:17.110" style="s2">little magic involved in the technology</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.179" end="01:16:18.579" style="s2">of 1925 vacuum tubes are kind of right</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.110" end="01:16:21.250" style="s2">at the cutting edge and maybe we live</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.579" end="01:16:24.179" style="s2">without vacuum tubes so we make it 1919</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.250" end="01:16:28.360" style="s2">but we could probably get back to 1919</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.179" end="01:16:31.329" style="s2">1925 by the skills that you would find</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.360" end="01:16:32.649" style="s2">in distributed rural areas</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.329" end="01:16:36.219" style="s2">then the question would be could we</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.649" end="01:16:38.050" style="s2">solidify a society at the 1925 level and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.219" end="01:16:40.929" style="s2">then from there we build relatively</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.050" end="01:16:43.719" style="s2">quickly probably less than clock time to</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.929" end="01:16:45.999" style="s2">get back to 2020 well if we&#39;re really</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.040" end="01:21:14.190" style="s2">even the most of the gas power plants</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.610" end="01:21:16.140" style="s2">cannot start unless there&#39;s power in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.190" end="01:21:19.170" style="s2">grid because they need the power in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.140" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">grid to magnetize they&#39;re electromagnets</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.170" end="01:21:22.710" style="s2">and so we do keep a certain amount of</p>

<p begin="01:21:22.710" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">of diesel generation around at least</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.590" end="01:21:30.210" style="s2">historically we have to be able to do</p>

<p begin="01:21:32.760" end="01:21:36.750" style="s2">reasons and as we know everybody&#39;s under</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.770" end="01:21:39.030" style="s2">economic pressure the amount of diesel</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.750" end="01:21:41.060" style="s2">generation has been declining while the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.030" end="01:21:44.130" style="s2">other asset classes have gone up of</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.060" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">generation and so again it would make a</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.130" end="01:21:48.540" style="s2">lot of sense to subsidize at the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:51.330" style="s2">a billion or two a year electrical</p>

<p begin="01:22:00.060" end="01:22:04.380" style="s2">for example was things like in Florida</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.160" end="01:22:06.690" style="s2">the local power authority got a rule</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.380" end="01:22:08.880" style="s2">that prohibited people from drawing</p>

<p begin="01:22:11.730" end="01:22:15.090" style="s2">it to the grid and what this meant was</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.350" end="01:22:17.910" style="s2">that during times of blackouts after</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.090" end="01:22:20.130" style="s2">climate crises that people who were</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.910" end="01:22:22.410" style="s2">actually generating power couldn&#39;t draw</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.130" end="01:22:24.390" style="s2">on that power and I&#39;ve just arranged to</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.410" end="01:22:26.970" style="s2">have solar installed here on my roof in</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.390" end="01:22:29.100" style="s2">Southern California and we are laboring</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.970" end="01:22:30.510" style="s2">under a similar condition although we</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.100" end="01:22:32.700" style="s2">are allowed to have a battery</p>

<p begin="01:22:32.700" end="01:22:37.110" style="s2">sell into the grid but we can&#39;t run our</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.230" end="01:22:39.060" style="s2">house off of our roof we have to run our</p>

<p begin="01:22:39.060" end="01:22:42.360" style="s2">our power into the grid and then bring</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.590" end="01:22:43.770" style="s2">it back and I can&#39;t help but think that</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.360" end="01:22:47.550" style="s2">there is an extent to which this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.770" end="01:22:49.410" style="s2">driven not by complexity but by a desire</p>

<p begin="01:22:54.000" end="01:22:57.450" style="s2">that I&#39;ve looked into this quite a bit</p>

<p begin="01:23:02.700" end="01:23:06.990" style="s2">remarkably dominated by our big energy</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.040" end="01:23:08.460" style="s2">company Dominion power pretty much</p>

<p begin="01:26:06.370" end="01:26:10.480" style="s2">the city effectively broke and we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.260" end="01:26:12.969" style="s2">got a sales tax which is the ultimate in</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.480" end="01:26:15.159" style="s2">regressive taxes and tax is the thing we</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.969" end="01:26:16.870" style="s2">want people to do which is buying things</p>

<p begin="01:26:28.210" end="01:26:31.180" style="s2">kind of big infrastructure project here</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.830" end="01:26:34.120" style="s2">in Burbank because we&#39;ve lost that</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.180" end="01:26:35.620" style="s2">source of revenue and you were hinting</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.120" end="01:26:38.320" style="s2">at and I think I&#39;ll go a little further</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.620" end="01:26:40.170" style="s2">which is that the longer-term answer to</p>

<p begin="01:26:40.170" end="01:26:44.860" style="s2">duplicating these core big components</p>

<p begin="01:26:44.860" end="01:26:50.080" style="s2">but moving towards a more decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.420" end="01:26:52.660" style="s2">grid there&#39;s no reason that we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.080" end="01:26:54.490" style="s2">have a regulatory regime and if we had</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.660" end="01:26:57.790" style="s2">non corrupt state legislatures we could</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.490" end="01:26:59.950" style="s2">have some tax incentives on the grounds</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.790" end="01:27:02.310" style="s2">that we are increasing social robustness</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.950" end="01:27:04.450" style="s2">and resilience by encouraging</p>

<p begin="01:27:06.100" end="01:27:10.480" style="s2">arguable whether household level</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.510" end="01:27:12.340" style="s2">photovoltaic actually makes sense but at</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.480" end="01:27:15.880" style="s2">the community level you know 50 houses</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.340" end="01:27:18.040" style="s2">100 houses there ought to be a national</p>
