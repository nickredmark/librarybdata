<p begin="00:15:23.160" end="00:15:28.439" style="s2">really think about it it doesn&#39;t seem</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.439" end="00:15:32.759" style="s2">lot of people mentioned Burning Man is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.289" end="00:15:36.179" style="s2">kind of like a mix we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.759" end="00:15:39.569" style="s2">subcultures and and before that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.179" end="00:15:42.170" style="s2">was like steampunk right I forgot but</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.569" end="00:15:45.200" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t really been anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.170" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">that&#39;s really been like a movement like</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.200" end="00:15:51.530" style="s2">this subculture like that I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:53.750" style="s2">been like different internet groups and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.530" end="00:15:56.660" style="s2">different digital tribes but there</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:15:59.000" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really been like a subculture</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.660" end="00:16:03.620" style="s2">with that kind of magnitude maybe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.000" end="00:16:05.630" style="s2">just outgrown it um and my society not</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.620" end="00:16:08.650" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ve just outgrown subculture</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.630" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">mode now where we&#39;re all monolithic um</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.650" end="00:16:14.960" style="s2">but it feels like now is a good time to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:18.650" style="s2">explore different subcultures that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.960" end="00:16:20.150" style="s2">hadn&#39;t really focused on before maybe so</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.650" end="00:16:23.450" style="s2">cultures that would be more viable now</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.150" end="00:16:26.870" style="s2">because of people learning for the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.450" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">time what&#39;s actually going on you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.870" end="00:16:31.730" style="s2">mean people have become more a week in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.050" style="s2">way where you can do things that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.730" end="00:16:36.110" style="s2">couldn&#39;t before and they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.050" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">looking to you for advice um so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.110" end="00:16:43.480" style="s2">just like a good time to think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:46.070" style="s2">what you&#39;re capable of right now um and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.480" end="00:16:50.330" style="s2">anybody can build an aesthetic movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.070" end="00:16:53.870" style="s2">and get people to join them you focus on</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.330" end="00:16:55.970" style="s2">style your focus on your personal</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.870" end="00:16:57.860" style="s2">desires and how you can build them in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.970" end="00:16:59.930" style="s2">the external world like whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.860" end="00:17:03.020" style="s2">through creating a piece of art that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.930" end="00:17:06.130" style="s2">a vision that you had display it on it</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.020" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">now I&#39;m just showing a people that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.130" end="00:17:11.390" style="s2">creative primal part of you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:14.380" style="s2">translating it translating it into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.390" end="00:17:16.970" style="s2">universe so people can pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.380" end="00:17:19.699" style="s2">connections that you have brought them</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.970" end="00:17:22.940" style="s2">on there is a deep ecologist element in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.699" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">art aesthetics are are deeply occult</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.940" end="00:17:27.470" style="s2">they&#39;re hidden they&#39;re not on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:29.540" style="s2">surface the surface is where everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.470" end="00:17:33.530" style="s2">is literal that&#39;s why people get in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.540" end="00:17:36.290" style="s2">trouble for saying things that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.530" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">would have get in trouble for making art</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.290" end="00:17:44.090" style="s2">of because art isn&#39;t on the surface it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:48.500" style="s2">a cult hidden and I would also say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.090" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">it is on a different metaphysical kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.500" end="00:17:51.420" style="s2">of thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">I&#39;m in terms of like having visions come</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.420" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">to you and just having snaps then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:58.380" style="s2">permission you know like just like we</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:00.750" style="s2">feel something and you&#39;re like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.380" end="00:18:02.010" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been looking for you know I</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.620" end="00:18:11.130" style="s2">that was urges that just make you go to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.100" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">where you&#39;ve been waiting to go for so</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.130" end="00:18:14.130" style="s2">long and you&#39;re finally there like</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:17.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.130" end="00:18:19.170" style="s2">channeling um and some you know there</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.820" end="00:18:23.610" style="s2">are some concerns like I don&#39;t want to</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.610" end="00:18:27.090" style="s2">you might be thinking it&#39;s yours live</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.990" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">right now I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.090" end="00:18:33.150" style="s2">that&#39;s what you have to learn so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:37.350" style="s2">you have to learn it&#39;s the the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.150" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">you know I&#39;m you have that demonic you</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.350" end="00:18:41.430" style="s2">know inspiration I mean even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:43.080" style="s2">positive and you&#39;ve learned to channel</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.430" end="00:18:45.240" style="s2">it and you&#39;ve learned to make it work</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.080" end="00:18:47.010" style="s2">for you in the most optimal way you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:49.110" style="s2">still have to know like them wants to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.010" end="00:18:51.780" style="s2">kick back with it and also like when to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.110" end="00:18:54.270" style="s2">not let your ego be involved at all when</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.780" end="00:18:57.750" style="s2">to just step away see things for how</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.270" end="00:19:00.690" style="s2">they are and don&#39;t involve yourself at</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.750" end="00:19:04.650" style="s2">all and that there are so many modes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.690" end="00:19:06.450" style="s2">this type of interaction I I think you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.650" end="00:19:08.550" style="s2">can learn from a lot of people that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.450" end="00:19:11.660" style="s2">might not think that you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.550" end="00:19:14.790" style="s2">I&#39;m people that that seemed to be a</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.790" end="00:19:22.040" style="s2">really good at doing things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.900" end="00:19:22.040" style="s2">not good at and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.100" end="00:19:29.049" style="s2">trying to view best judgmental of people</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.710" end="00:19:56.080" style="s2">lot about people from their aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:58.210" style="s2">but they put out in the world with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.080" end="00:20:01.390" style="s2">way that they dress the way they speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.210" end="00:20:02.830" style="s2">the way they present themselves with the</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:17.529" style="s2">had like 20 people to fill me with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.529" end="00:22:22.509" style="s2">I think he needs to do something about</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.529" end="00:22:24.789" style="s2">the hair it seems like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.509" end="00:22:27.580" style="s2">theme going and what you&#39;re saying I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.789" end="00:22:30.700" style="s2">like its pre-existing like you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.580" end="00:22:32.679" style="s2">that as a movement that we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.700" end="00:22:35.259" style="s2">inherited we&#39;re kind of inside of right</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.679" end="00:22:37.090" style="s2">now and it&#39;s calcified right so you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.259" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">like the social justice kind of post</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.090" end="00:22:41.799" style="s2">modernist side which has really claimed</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:43.779" style="s2">art I mean in a really serious way they</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.799" end="00:22:46.419" style="s2">have like staked their territory around</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.779" end="00:22:48.730" style="s2">art and all art as political and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.419" end="00:22:50.860" style="s2">interesting how that approach to art is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.730" end="00:22:52.360" style="s2">very overt which is almost the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.860" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">of what you&#39;re talking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.360" end="00:22:57.460" style="s2">prints ggressive art or art as</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:23:02.019" style="s2">transgressive action or communication it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.460" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">is not so obvious what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.019" end="00:23:08.289" style="s2">and it&#39;s up to the the experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:09.639" style="s2">between the art and the end experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.289" end="00:23:12.100" style="s2">of the artist and the person</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.639" end="00:23:14.919" style="s2">experiencing the art to discover in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.100" end="00:23:19.000" style="s2">space between what the implications of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.919" end="00:23:22.330" style="s2">that interaction is and it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.000" end="00:23:25.299" style="s2">this idea of transgressive is both kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.330" end="00:23:28.419" style="s2">of bringing back to this quality of art</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.299" end="00:23:30.309" style="s2">that breaks through categories which I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.419" end="00:23:32.850" style="s2">see also in other elements of your work</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.309" end="00:23:35.620" style="s2">you&#39;re taking like the art right is like</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.850" end="00:23:39.070" style="s2">taking art which is like a leftist</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.620" end="00:23:41.710" style="s2">product and moving it into the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.070" end="00:23:45.429" style="s2">which is like appreciation of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.710" end="00:23:47.529" style="s2">and tradition and like and mashing them</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.429" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">together beyond the center how can you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.529" end="00:23:50.740" style="s2">be a be beyond a center so I see this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:57.040" style="s2">like pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.740" end="00:23:59.350" style="s2">your work of trying to remix all of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.040" end="00:24:01.720" style="s2">categorical assumptions that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.350" end="00:24:05.400" style="s2">that&#39;s being kind of the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.720" end="00:24:09.670" style="s2">rebirth of this new aesthetic movement</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.400" end="00:24:12.070" style="s2">do you see do you have anything yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.670" end="00:24:13.990" style="s2">like the way they put that I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.070" end="00:24:15.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the resurrection anymore you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.990" end="00:24:18.309" style="s2">could even say the insurrection and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.460" end="00:24:22.179" style="s2">like an aesthetic it&#39;s direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.309" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">Spirit you know like it&#39;s a feeling you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.179" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">just you know it it&#39;s like when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.220" end="00:24:30.370" style="s2">reached the Empire - just eat and when</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.679" style="s2">you you have that force you can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.370" end="00:24:35.230" style="s2">whatever you want with it but you do</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.679" end="00:24:39.370" style="s2">have to be careful sometimes um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">not even productive to even discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.370" end="00:24:47.530" style="s2">people who are censoring and banning</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:51.010" style="s2">things because it&#39;s just why are we not</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.530" end="00:24:54.040" style="s2">building better things like why are they</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.010" end="00:24:55.300" style="s2">even a topic like I do not want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.040" end="00:24:59.380" style="s2">about people that are holding us back</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.300" end="00:25:01.890" style="s2">with these codes is the fault of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.380" end="00:25:05.790" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re they&#39;re doing there</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.890" end="00:25:09.010" style="s2">yeah what why should we even have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.790" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">communicate at that level of where where</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.010" end="00:25:13.179" style="s2">everybody&#39;s hiding I mean like were</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:16.630" style="s2">literally wearing masks right now it</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.179" end="00:25:19.480" style="s2">makes sense but if you think about how</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.630" end="00:25:24.010" style="s2">everybody was hiding before and all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.480" end="00:25:27.429" style="s2">repression and the it&#39;s just it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.010" end="00:25:30.250" style="s2">good environment to be and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.429" end="00:25:34.750" style="s2">self-expression and art and it&#39;s some it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.250" end="00:25:41.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hurt anybody you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.750" end="00:25:44.650" style="s2">can&#39;t um be yeah yeah art is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.280" end="00:25:47.740" style="s2">almost like Anna Strauss II and sense to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.650" end="00:25:51.820" style="s2">transgress the limits of like heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.740" end="00:25:54.940" style="s2">thinking because you display it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.820" end="00:25:57.220" style="s2">that isn&#39;t immediately understandable to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.940" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">people but the people who get it they</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.220" end="00:26:02.950" style="s2">really get it and it draws them in</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:05.049" style="s2">totally yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.950" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">get two more questions I saw that Peter</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:12.460" style="s2">would like to unmute yourself Peter</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.779" end="00:26:18.299" style="s2">invite anybody else to put that question</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.460" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">to the test process one beer kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.299" end="00:26:28.750" style="s2">mixes up the game one energy and so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">question relates to insanity sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.750" end="00:26:36.760" style="s2">and community because artists you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:39.850" style="s2">they&#39;re on the brink of insanity if they</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.760" end="00:26:41.639" style="s2">follow the dame on energy exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.850" end="00:26:45.309" style="s2">places no else wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.639" end="00:26:49.710" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering will came alive to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.309" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">when you were talking rachel is that is</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.470" end="00:30:12.530" style="s2">like how whatever is going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.010" end="00:30:14.810" style="s2">we&#39;re bumping up into like a real</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.530" end="00:30:16.370" style="s2">boundary that just logic and and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.810" end="00:30:18.680" style="s2">kind of shit is just not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.370" end="00:30:20.690" style="s2">pushing past and so I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.680" end="00:30:22.550" style="s2">about this issue of like aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.690" end="00:30:24.650" style="s2">aesthetic movements that can break</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.550" end="00:30:26.030" style="s2">through in the same way and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.650" end="00:30:27.950" style="s2">very hard time thinking of something</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.030" end="00:30:30.440" style="s2">that I think would be good except that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.950" end="00:30:33.370" style="s2">keep realizing and remembering that like</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.440" end="00:30:39.380" style="s2">the whole thing with memes is in itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.370" end="00:30:41.870" style="s2">it seems to fit the it seems to fit the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.380" end="00:30:44.150" style="s2">like the requirement in that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.870" end="00:30:45.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s like a new form of language</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.150" end="00:30:48.350" style="s2">that&#39;s primary aesthetic that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.800" end="00:30:50.140" style="s2">thing about it it seems to break through</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.350" end="00:30:52.730" style="s2">in ways that like other things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.140" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean like as a genre of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.730" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">expression it&#39;s like it&#39;s a thing from</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">4chan and like the shit like the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:01.370" style="s2">shit that they do it like doesn&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.050" style="s2">through but in but in some other sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.370" end="00:31:05.630" style="s2">like their whole language of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.050" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">communication is now how we communicate</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.630" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">on the Internet at least aesthetically</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.120" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">and so there&#39;s that little thing but at</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:19.640" style="s2">the same time it feels like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:21.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not enough or it&#39;s not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.640" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">like lacking of a kind of vitality I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.470" end="00:31:27.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you I&#39;m wondering what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:29.210" style="s2">think the limitations are that means</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.080" end="00:31:31.130" style="s2">that like even though it seems like from</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.210" end="00:31:33.560" style="s2">the description that means qualified but</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.130" end="00:31:35.720" style="s2">then like they&#39;re not enough yep any</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.560" end="00:31:37.100" style="s2">comments on why I think that is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.720" end="00:31:39.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question I definitely agree</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.100" end="00:31:42.050" style="s2">with what you said about the aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.170" end="00:31:45.680" style="s2">becoming a norm and internet culture and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.050" end="00:31:47.980" style="s2">yeah I mean like not just works you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.680" end="00:31:50.820" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s enough right</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.820" end="00:31:57.960" style="s2">the people who are at least into that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.419" end="00:32:00.600" style="s2">that like some kind of spark there you</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.660" end="00:41:14.350" style="s2">opportunity it&#39;s here you never know</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.100" end="00:41:19.660" style="s2">what you might learn and what that might</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.350" end="00:41:21.910" style="s2">do for you what do you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.660" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">the kind of lack of aesthetic expression</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.910" end="00:41:30.190" style="s2">that we see in most of the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">community I think that a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.190" end="00:41:38.350" style="s2">might come from an academic backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:41.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not familiar but by I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.350" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">but there&#39;s a desire to be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.740" end="00:41:49.390" style="s2">mature and in a way that can be people</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:52.300" style="s2">the little drab I see that in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.390" end="00:41:55.810" style="s2">groups and it&#39;s just about like building</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.300" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">your own personal elegance and now being</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.810" end="00:41:59.980" style="s2">able to create yourself in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:04.210" style="s2">you feel it was in line with who you are</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.980" end="00:42:06.760" style="s2">I think that in some cultures like some</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.210" end="00:42:09.880" style="s2">more Eastern cultures self-expression is</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.760" end="00:42:14.080" style="s2">looked down upon for being too</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.880" end="00:42:16.740" style="s2">associated with the ego and I I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.080" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">like the West is considered over</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.740" end="00:42:23.500" style="s2">individualistic so I mean it might</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:27.220" style="s2">depend on if you&#39;re coming at it with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.500" end="00:42:29.650" style="s2">more like demonic or like a Promethean</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.220" end="00:42:32.980" style="s2">energy when I heard Peters talk earlier</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.650" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">I kept thinking of Promethean because he</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.980" end="00:42:36.130" style="s2">was talking about stealing on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:37.750" style="s2">culture and thinking about stand the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.130" end="00:42:40.390" style="s2">fire from the gods you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.750" end="00:42:42.040" style="s2">Promethean Renaissance like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.390" end="00:42:45.250" style="s2">those that I&#39;ve ever met</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.040" end="00:42:47.230" style="s2">he&#39;s building to atmosphere for me you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.250" end="00:42:50.310" style="s2">know it&#39;s the Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.230" end="00:42:54.420" style="s2">it&#39;s the aesthetic Renaissance and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.310" end="00:42:54.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m working forward</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.349" end="00:43:01.960" style="s2">Raya would you like to admit yourself</p>

<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:17.589" style="s2">nice edge of expression and I said</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.789" end="00:43:24.009" style="s2">expression do you mean like the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.589" end="00:43:26.229" style="s2">hurt I think just like maybe supporting</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.009" end="00:43:29.140" style="s2">people and be more being more brave or</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.229" end="00:43:30.519" style="s2">courageous and exploring expressive</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.140" end="00:43:34.930" style="s2">modalities that they might be curious</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.519" end="00:43:37.539" style="s2">about but aren&#39;t necessarily like have</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.930" end="00:43:39.549" style="s2">the confidence to do it like if they</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.130" end="00:43:55.720" style="s2">that life statement but um I think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.859" end="00:43:58.410" style="s2">people have to get out of those traps</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.720" end="00:44:02.799" style="s2">and negative stories about themselves</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.630" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">want now because people don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.790" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">stupid culture word things because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:17.090" style="s2">got a freaking bones and I got there oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.650" end="00:46:18.620" style="s2">my god right so you know I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.090" end="00:46:21.650" style="s2">think those things are relevant anymore</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.620" end="00:46:23.780" style="s2">I tend to find mainstream politics to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.650" end="00:46:26.870" style="s2">very tiring and political consumers to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.780" end="00:46:29.180" style="s2">be even stupider and I would rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.870" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">avoid that kind of thing and just focus</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.180" end="00:46:33.980" style="s2">on aesthetics I&#39;m divorcing aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:36.020" style="s2">from politics divorcing art from</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.980" end="00:46:39.380" style="s2">politics this is where it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.020" end="00:46:41.540" style="s2">crucial that if you feel like your art</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.380" end="00:46:43.220" style="s2">is making a political steam and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.540" end="00:46:44.780" style="s2">might be offending a certain group and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.220" end="00:46:46.790" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it for that reason are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.780" end="00:46:49.610" style="s2">really making art or are you just making</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.790" end="00:46:53.630" style="s2">politics like to really make art even if</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.610" end="00:46:56.110" style="s2">you&#39;re inspired by political you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.630" end="00:46:58.970" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s like propaganda or</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.110" end="00:47:01.460" style="s2">uniforms or burqa texture whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.970" end="00:47:03.830" style="s2">you&#39;re inspired by politically that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.460" end="00:47:06.230" style="s2">might not be inspired by politically for</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.830" end="00:47:09.250" style="s2">example you guys love those uniforms</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.230" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">right um same kind of being politics are</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.250" end="00:47:17.330" style="s2">separate separate but if you feel you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:19.730" style="s2">know like your creation is a political</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.330" end="00:47:22.310" style="s2">statement you know maybe that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.730" end="00:47:22.920" style="s2">right creation to be having because then</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.310" end="00:47:24.650" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.920" end="00:47:33.089" style="s2">not really an artist you&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.650" end="00:47:35.849" style="s2">politician who is making art yeah Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.089" end="00:47:38.430" style="s2">had a really good response to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.849" end="00:47:40.770" style="s2">of like you know bad art good art like</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.430" end="00:47:44.190" style="s2">what is that dimension Jordan would you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.770" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">like to make your comment oh I was just</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.190" end="00:47:49.950" style="s2">saying that like I think a lot of both</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:53.730" style="s2">some more underground stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.950" end="00:47:55.619" style="s2">really appreciate but the when the Joker</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.730" end="00:47:59.130" style="s2">movie came out to me it was like a huge</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.619" end="00:48:00.660" style="s2">thing because when you look at what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.130" end="00:48:03.150" style="s2">happening in Hollywood usually you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.660" end="00:48:05.490" style="s2">these like very very intense aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.150" end="00:48:07.079" style="s2">things but that they feel very hollow</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.490" end="00:48:10.140" style="s2">because they feel like they&#39;re made for</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.079" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">a weird like like end in history</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.140" end="00:48:16.950" style="s2">ideology kind of that belongs maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:18.809" style="s2">like 2005 or something like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.950" end="00:48:20.280" style="s2">they feel hollow despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.809" end="00:48:24.150" style="s2">they have all this aesthetic strengths</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.280" end="00:48:26.369" style="s2">of them meanwhile now the Joker also has</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.150" end="00:48:27.630" style="s2">aesthetic strength but it&#39;s calling upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.369" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">a lot of ideas that have been</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.630" end="00:48:34.290" style="s2">percolating in like online spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.970" style="s2">shit for a long time and the vitality of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.290" end="00:48:37.079" style="s2">that movie isn&#39;t just in the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.970" end="00:48:39.089" style="s2">of it although the aesthetics very</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.079" end="00:48:40.799" style="s2">important the point the point that I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.089" end="00:48:42.359" style="s2">making before is that if you&#39;re worried</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.799" end="00:48:48.660" style="s2">about the fact that maybe you&#39;re a bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.359" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">artist if the real problem with the art</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.660" end="00:48:53.220" style="s2">movement right now is that it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:55.799" style="s2">vital because it&#39;s not being honest</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.220" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">about the way shit is and you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.799" end="00:48:59.220" style="s2">really see the world in the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:00.660" style="s2">see it in the art right now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.220" end="00:49:02.520" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird like vampire not</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.660" end="00:49:05.549" style="s2">appearing in the mirror kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.520" end="00:49:08.549" style="s2">you could make very compelling art just</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.549" end="00:49:10.109" style="s2">by addressing the world as it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.549" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">looks right now even if you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.109" end="00:49:14.040" style="s2">like a bad rapper or your black</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.510" end="00:49:16.170" style="s2">technical skills and so on and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.040" end="00:49:22.859" style="s2">might be enough to overcome this issue</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.170" end="00:49:27.240" style="s2">of like yeah I definitely agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.859" end="00:49:31.049" style="s2">there I mean some people are not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.240" end="00:49:35.220" style="s2">be able to understand you know that kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.049" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">of art so to speak but I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.220" end="00:49:40.680" style="s2">but if you can put it out there and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:43.530" style="s2">should um I think when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.680" end="00:49:45.270" style="s2">about bad is that like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.530" end="00:49:47.310" style="s2">aesthetics there&#39;s good because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.270" end="00:49:51.180" style="s2">some really skilled artists that first</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.310" end="00:49:54.060" style="s2">etics but they&#39;re just really good the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.180" end="00:49:55.290" style="s2">foundations on and vice versa uh you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.060" end="00:49:56.520" style="s2">know when in the underground scene that</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.290" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about you see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.520" end="00:49:59.819" style="s2">really talented artists that I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.800" style="s2">should get the craft but they have</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.819" end="00:50:03.300" style="s2">really good ideas and then in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.800" end="00:50:05.130" style="s2">mainstream you see a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.300" end="00:50:07.470" style="s2">are really amazing other problems that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.130" end="00:50:09.060" style="s2">have horrible idea ISM and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.470" end="00:50:11.130" style="s2">what we need is for the people of good</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.060" end="00:50:13.079" style="s2">ideas to be working with each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.130" end="00:50:14.849" style="s2">right on and the people that are good</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.079" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">with their craft to you breaking out</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.849" end="00:50:19.530" style="s2">each other um so but what happens the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:21.900" style="s2">underground artists to be good enough at</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.530" end="00:50:24.180" style="s2">their craft to find somebody that has</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.900" end="00:50:27.270" style="s2">more power influence or whatever status</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.180" end="00:50:31.260" style="s2">game that can like fine tune them here</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.270" end="00:50:33.869" style="s2">yeah you know more more commercial and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.260" end="00:50:37.530" style="s2">acceptable because I mean you you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.869" end="00:50:40.170" style="s2">like them underground that you not want</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.530" end="00:50:41.790" style="s2">people to hear you know I&#39;m that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.170" end="00:50:43.950" style="s2">part of like if you&#39;ve been involved in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.790" end="00:50:47.490" style="s2">like the dark kind of Dawn&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.950" end="00:50:49.800" style="s2">goth industrial yada yada um like</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.490" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.800" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">like that only you and a few people like</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">you know and then that&#39;s okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:02.579" style="s2">fine like if you like them like fucked</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">up films or or whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.579" end="00:51:11.270" style="s2">you&#39;re into you know I I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:16.050" style="s2">art always needs to be pretty it can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.270" end="00:51:20.520" style="s2">confrontational and beautiful in a more</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.050" end="00:51:24.060" style="s2">aggressive way a more vitalist way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.520" end="00:51:26.040" style="s2">is a lot heavier where modern art is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.060" end="00:51:28.740" style="s2">we&#39;re rightfully complaining up above</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.040" end="00:51:31.589" style="s2">before is very light on and submissive</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.740" end="00:51:34.500" style="s2">if I hear what you&#39;re saying correctly</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.589" end="00:51:37.020" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really do anything it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.500" end="00:51:41.460" style="s2">really move anyone it&#39;s not a movement</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.020" end="00:51:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a lack of movement it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.460" end="00:51:51.310" style="s2">stagnation I would like to solve stab</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.160" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">you know it would be great to not have</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.310" end="00:51:56.860" style="s2">art like that anymore we can&#39;t get rid</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:52:01.350" style="s2">of it we should create art that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.860" end="00:52:01.350" style="s2">like that offer a better alternative</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.030" end="00:52:11.950" style="s2">yeah yeah I think one other thing though</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.100" end="00:52:13.120" style="s2">as I mentioned this in another maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.950" end="00:52:14.770" style="s2">I&#39;ll just throw this in there but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.120" end="00:52:17.890" style="s2">mentioned this in another thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.770" end="00:52:20.650" style="s2">did there is this guy who has like</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.890" end="00:52:22.540" style="s2">almost no followers he used to his like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.650" end="00:52:23.890" style="s2">a punk musician used to call till school</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.540" end="00:52:26.080" style="s2">shooter and they had to change his name</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.890" end="00:52:28.810" style="s2">to something else because the feds were</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.080" end="00:52:32.050" style="s2">coming after him and unlike on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.810" end="00:52:35.230" style="s2">but he made this really cool song called</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.050" end="00:52:37.960" style="s2">MKULTRA victim and it&#39;s like really it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.960" end="00:52:42.010" style="s2">guy he&#39;s like one guy playing all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.790" end="00:52:44.200" style="s2">instruments and like the mixing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.010" end="00:52:48.700" style="s2">very good but it&#39;s this like really</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.200" end="00:52:50.860" style="s2">crazy song about how he&#39;s like grown up</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.550" end="00:53:10.270" style="s2">something that&#39;s alive like in the</p>
