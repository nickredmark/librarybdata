<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:33.080" style="s2">you already know me I&#39;m sort of one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:34.970" style="s2">those anti box people so I don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.080" end="00:01:38.360" style="s2">fit into boxes I&#39;ve got a lot of you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.970" end="00:01:40.100" style="s2">relate to that and I think my big focus</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.360" end="00:01:43.400" style="s2">areas over the last couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:45.830" style="s2">have been in complexity science and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.400" end="00:01:48.460" style="s2">cultural evolution all directed toward</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.830" end="00:01:51.380" style="s2">trying to keep humans from going extinct</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.460" end="00:01:54.650" style="s2">which we are foolishly at jeopardy of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.380" end="00:01:56.720" style="s2">doing at the moment and so a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.650" end="00:02:00.290" style="s2">I will you know talk with you about</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.720" end="00:02:03.530" style="s2">today is my experiences and learnings</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.290" end="00:02:06.110" style="s2">about the planetary scale ecological</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.530" end="00:02:08.030" style="s2">crisis that were in and the global</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.110" end="00:02:10.759" style="s2">systems of human cultures that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.030" end="00:02:14.540" style="s2">driving it and what we might need to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.759" end="00:02:15.860" style="s2">in order to have you know beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.540" end="00:02:17.870" style="s2">pastures on the other side or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.860" end="00:02:20.810" style="s2">better yet beautiful food forests and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.870" end="00:02:23.110" style="s2">fully intact ecosystems so it&#39;s lovely</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.810" end="00:02:23.110" style="s2">to be here</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">great so go ahead and lift us off into</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.620" end="00:02:37.849" style="s2">jo-jo worlds I&#39;ll be here for you sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.200" end="00:02:40.430" style="s2">well one thing I want to say and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.849" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">starting is that a lot of my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.430" end="00:02:45.560" style="s2">across my life and the work that I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:48.470" style="s2">comes from an experience of feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.560" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">an alien when I was a little kid which</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:52.220" style="s2">was like three years old on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:53.720" style="s2">playground in preschool wondering why</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.220" end="00:02:56.629" style="s2">all the kids were so mean to each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.720" end="00:02:58.519" style="s2">and and then spending a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.629" end="00:03:01.069" style="s2">nature on the farm where I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.519" end="00:03:04.549" style="s2">Missouri feeling like I didn&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.069" end="00:03:05.959" style="s2">and actually kind of hating humans in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.549" end="00:03:08.569" style="s2">lot of ways like having a chip on my</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.959" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">shoulder in that teenage way and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.569" end="00:03:12.109" style="s2">stuff and a lot of it being because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.510" style="s2">a really emotionally sensitive person</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.109" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">but I&#39;m also a pretty good analytic</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.510" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">thinker and so I&#39;m so I start there</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.590" style="s2">because I feel like we&#39;re in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:24.500" style="s2">right now that I would call a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.590" end="00:03:26.209" style="s2">crisis and it&#39;s a spiritual crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.500" end="00:03:29.030" style="s2">having to do with the very nature of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.209" end="00:03:32.660" style="s2">existence as human beings and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.030" end="00:03:34.459" style="s2">spiritual crisis because it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.660" end="00:03:37.579" style="s2">depth and foundations of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.459" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">what we consider to be sacred and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.579" end="00:03:42.349" style="s2">about our lack of sense making around</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">the sacred a lot of people find having</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.349" end="00:03:47.060" style="s2">jobs and mythical security as sacred</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:48.950" style="s2">when they send their kids away and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.060" end="00:03:50.989" style="s2">never see their kids and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.950" end="00:03:52.099" style="s2">a lot of confusion like this around they</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.989" end="00:03:53.569" style="s2">would much rather have the times with</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:57.310" style="s2">their kids but what&#39;s sacred isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.569" end="00:04:00.079" style="s2">they do and that disconnect is very real</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.310" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">for me a lot of what I see happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.079" end="00:04:05.449" style="s2">the world today is based on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">developmental pattern within the Earth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.449" end="00:04:10.069" style="s2">biosphere that goes back at least three</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">million years and I want to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.069" end="00:04:14.419" style="s2">story in this way because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:17.030" style="s2">too often we contextualize what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.419" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">happening now around superficial and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.030" end="00:04:21.289" style="s2">symptomatic things like there&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:23.030" style="s2">pandemic and that&#39;s the problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.289" end="00:04:25.039" style="s2">like no no no that&#39;s a symptom of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.030" end="00:04:28.310" style="s2">globally interconnected human economy</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.039" end="00:04:31.639" style="s2">that&#39;s not a cause of the problem and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:33.200" style="s2">think that no that mismatch between true</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.639" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">driving patterns and what&#39;s going on is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.200" end="00:04:38.910" style="s2">a real discernment opportunity for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">we can design causation well we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.910" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">actually do something about what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:43.950" style="s2">predicaments were in and I go back three</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:46.620" style="s2">million years in time to tell this story</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.950" end="00:04:48.600" style="s2">because something novel happened about</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.620" end="00:04:50.790" style="s2">three million years ago in the history</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.600" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2">of the Earth&#39;s biosphere which is for</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.790" end="00:04:55.140" style="s2">the first time at least that we have any</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.380" end="00:04:57.480" style="s2">empirical record of some piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.140" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">Earth&#39;s biosphere gained a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.480" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">capacity for conceptual thought and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">is that our Homo habilis ancestor is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:08.970" style="s2">stone tool users could look at a rock</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.510" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">and metaphorically project other uses</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.970" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">onto it and then carve and shape it into</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">those uses and so that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:18.690" style="s2">created their hand wielded cutting tools</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:21.810" style="s2">from from stone so three million years</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.690" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">ago our ancestors evolved the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.810" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">for conceptual metaphor which is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:30.290" style="s2">foundational piece of human language in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.580" end="00:05:32.820" style="s2">the human mind this began what became</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.290" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">eventually a runaway process of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.820" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">evolution which is what we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.440" end="00:05:39.510" style="s2">with in the world today just basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:42.260" style="s2">there emerged from this initial</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.510" end="00:05:45.270" style="s2">conceptual capacity of our ancestors the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.260" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">ability to have an evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.270" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">for human culture now would be either</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">deeply integrated with its background</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.740" end="00:05:55.350" style="s2">ecology or it couldn&#39;t become separate</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:58.110" style="s2">from it and can function in parallel and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.350" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">this is what a lot of people in cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:02.640" style="s2">evolution research they call dual</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:05.190" style="s2">inheritance theory that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.640" end="00:06:08.190" style="s2">inheritance of genetics and the biome</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.190" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">the biological inheritance and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.190" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">also cultural evolutionary inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.610" style="s2">like we don&#39;t develop languages</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.290" end="00:06:16.770" style="s2">ourselves they&#39;re taught to us by our</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.610" end="00:06:19.350" style="s2">culture and a lot of what we get as</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.770" end="00:06:20.940" style="s2">humans is being adapted to environments</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.350" end="00:06:22.860" style="s2">that are as much human constructed</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.940" end="00:06:25.050" style="s2">environments as they are natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.860" end="00:06:27.090" style="s2">ecological environments and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.050" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">actually goes back to those stone tools</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.090" end="00:06:31.830" style="s2">three million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.810" style="s2">um I start here because the problem we</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.830" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">have in the world today is that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.810" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">evolution in humans but there other</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2">kinds of cultural evolution by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:41.760" style="s2">like birds with their bird songs and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:43.950" style="s2">whales with their whale songs and so on</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.760" end="00:06:46.260" style="s2">so cultural evolution is not limited</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.950" end="00:06:47.970" style="s2">humans but humans have something that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.260" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">far seems to be it the one standout</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.970" end="00:06:51.990" style="s2">thing that makes us different</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.710" end="00:06:53.340" style="s2">is cultural evolution and the human lime</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.990" end="00:06:55.500" style="s2">is cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.340" end="00:06:57.860" style="s2">whereas if not cumulative in any other</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.500" end="00:07:00.420" style="s2">species that we have evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.860" end="00:07:02.910" style="s2">cumulative processes by the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.420" end="00:07:05.340" style="s2">compounding interest and so on they</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.910" end="00:07:07.200" style="s2">create exponential change patterns so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.340" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">cumulative cultural evolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.200" end="00:07:12.750" style="s2">human line makes cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:15.090" style="s2">potentially exponential and our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.750" end="00:07:16.260" style="s2">evolution has become exponential which</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.090" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">is why we&#39;re able to do things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.260" end="00:07:21.600" style="s2">destabilize the entire planet&#39;s climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">system because our culture is now more</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.600" end="00:07:26.370" style="s2">powerful than the Earth&#39;s climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:30.330" style="s2">regulatory capacities so this thing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:31.920" style="s2">an exponential change in culture is one</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.330" end="00:07:34.110" style="s2">of the fundamental drivers of change on</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.920" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">the planet right now that&#39;s why we call</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.110" end="00:07:39.090" style="s2">this time least geologists do they call</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">it the Anthropocene we&#39;ve entered this</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.090" end="00:07:45.270" style="s2">unique time in history what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:47.400" style="s2">share is some of what I see happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.270" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">with the Anthropocene as it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.400" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">the work of when margolis and James</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.100" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">those strange polymaths who couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.650" end="00:08:05.460" style="s2">look at a problem unlike anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:08.850" style="s2">around him and when he was working for</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.850" end="00:08:13.200" style="s2">research projects he was asked a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.010" end="00:08:15.630" style="s2">specific question question they asked</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.200" end="00:08:17.640" style="s2">him was what is the chemical signature</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.630" end="00:08:19.950" style="s2">of life on a planet if we were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.640" end="00:08:22.320" style="s2">build a satellite sensor how would we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.950" end="00:08:23.370" style="s2">know if there&#39;s life on that planet and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.320" end="00:08:25.470" style="s2">he thought about it for a little while</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.370" end="00:08:26.850" style="s2">and said well there would be chemical</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.470" end="00:08:29.490" style="s2">processes that would be far from</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.850" end="00:08:31.800" style="s2">equilibrium because living systems drive</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.490" end="00:08:33.570" style="s2">chemistry far from equilibrium see what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.800" end="00:08:35.790" style="s2">it see things like high concentrations</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.570" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">of oxygen in the atmosphere because</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.790" end="00:08:40.020" style="s2">oxygen is highly reactive and would move</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">toward equilibrium very quickly unless</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.020" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">there&#39;s life that&#39;s reproducing it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:47.430" style="s2">then they developed a sensor to look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">the oxygen absorption bands including oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.430" end="00:08:50.940" style="s2">three or a zone that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:52.980" style="s2">discovered the ozone layer and they was</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.940" end="00:08:56.220" style="s2">on whole or rather I thought the ozone</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.980" end="00:08:58.740" style="s2">hole was discovered and so he and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.220" end="00:09:00.900" style="s2">margaret&#39;s developed a framework for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.740" end="00:09:02.700" style="s2">entire planet to be self-regulatory with</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.900" end="00:09:04.650" style="s2">these processes</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.700" end="00:09:07.140" style="s2">so the higher the guy hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.650" end="00:09:09.390" style="s2">the Earth&#39;s biosphere regulates the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.140" end="00:09:10.770" style="s2">chemistry of the earth to keep life</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.390" end="00:09:13.950" style="s2">conducive to life</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.770" end="00:09:16.070" style="s2">to paraphrase Jane Janine Benyus as she</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.950" end="00:09:19.230" style="s2">says this the entire planet does this</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.070" end="00:09:22.070" style="s2">what&#39;s different about humans is humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.230" end="00:09:24.660" style="s2">are able to be compassionate analytic</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.070" end="00:09:28.050" style="s2">conscious and self-aware parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.660" end="00:09:32.690" style="s2">planet while it&#39;s doing this and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.050" end="00:09:35.490" style="s2">are watching ourselves destroy ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.690" end="00:09:37.290" style="s2">which anthropologists and psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.490" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">talk about this creates a thing called</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.290" end="00:09:41.150" style="s2">terror management they need to manage</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:44.910" style="s2">the terror of knowing their own death</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.150" end="00:09:46.230" style="s2">just related to consumer marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.910" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">lots of fun ways we can discuss in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.230" end="00:09:51.030" style="s2">Q&amp;A part if people are interested but</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2">well what&#39;s really interesting is right</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.030" end="00:09:57.450" style="s2">now we&#39;re in a time where the Gaia</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:10:00.450" style="s2">hypothesis could become the gaia get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.450" end="00:10:02.330" style="s2">gut like the gaia design pathway where</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.450" end="00:10:05.400" style="s2">we as humans could collectively decide</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.330" end="00:10:07.340" style="s2">to design a pathway of regulating and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.400" end="00:10:11.340" style="s2">maintaining homeostasis for the earth</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.340" end="00:10:13.800" style="s2">and if we did that then we would get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.340" end="00:10:16.200" style="s2">stick around and if we don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.800" end="00:10:18.690" style="s2">then we may do like ninety-nine point</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.200" end="00:10:23.340" style="s2">seven percent of other species and go</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.690" end="00:10:25.140" style="s2">extinct and so um so what I see right</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.340" end="00:10:27.270" style="s2">now is our interesting opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.140" end="00:10:28.590" style="s2">recognize the ways that we have taken</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.270" end="00:10:31.710" style="s2">things far from equilibrium that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.590" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">destructive like pulling a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.710" end="00:10:35.910" style="s2">of dead sunlight out of the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:37.170" style="s2">pumping it into the biosphere and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.910" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2">Earth&#39;s atmosphere and a span of 200</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.170" end="00:10:42.990" style="s2">years seems like that was a pretty dumb</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:44.760" style="s2">idea and over growing and overshooting</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.990" end="00:10:48.150" style="s2">the human population by several billion</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.760" end="00:10:49.830" style="s2">people was a bad idea and so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.150" end="00:10:52.650" style="s2">gonna have to deal with the ecological</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.830" end="00:10:55.800" style="s2">consequences of planetary overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.650" end="00:10:57.450" style="s2">which are now decades old and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.800" end="00:11:01.740" style="s2">initiated before anyone on this call was</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.450" end="00:11:03.690" style="s2">born and we have to do with the massive</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.740" end="00:11:05.160" style="s2">grieving process of dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.690" end="00:11:07.110" style="s2">reality of how much suffering we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.160" end="00:11:09.540" style="s2">already caused and now much is now</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.110" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">guaranteed and built-in for the next 50</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.540" end="00:11:14.790" style="s2">to 100 years because if we can hold the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:16.410" style="s2">capacity to do that then we can do</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.790" end="00:11:19.560" style="s2">something amazing</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.410" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">which is we can bring robust and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.560" end="00:11:23.970" style="s2">life back to landscapes all across the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">planet as the human population corrects</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.970" end="00:11:30.120" style="s2">itself ecologically and as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:33.030" style="s2">capitalist extractive economic models</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.120" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">and the dominance territorial conquests</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.030" end="00:11:37.260" style="s2">models of Empires and civilizations all</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:39.630" style="s2">self-terminate because that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.260" end="00:11:41.880" style="s2">all do if you look at the history of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.630" end="00:11:43.800" style="s2">civilizations and empires every single</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.880" end="00:11:47.580" style="s2">one of them has collapsed so this one</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:50.700" style="s2">will - that&#39;s guaranteed and so our work</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.580" end="00:11:52.230" style="s2">is not to save this civilization but to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.700" end="00:11:55.740" style="s2">keep humans as part of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.230" end="00:11:56.850" style="s2">afterwards and just saying this you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.740" end="00:11:58.700" style="s2">see this is a tough pill to swallow</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.850" end="00:12:01.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of grief a lot of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.700" end="00:12:03.270" style="s2">associated with this but I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.470" end="00:12:06.210" style="s2">know waste any time being gentle about</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.270" end="00:12:08.220" style="s2">it because it&#39;s the year 2020</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.210" end="00:12:12.270" style="s2">well I climate action needed to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.220" end="00:12:14.130" style="s2">40 years ago and we didn&#39;t the Green</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.230" end="00:12:23.220" style="s2">consequences of and so those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.870" end="00:12:25.710" style="s2">are going to try to do really deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.220" end="00:12:26.940" style="s2">systemic work now need to have really</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.710" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">good discernment skills for what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.940" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">hell&#39;s going on and one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:34.920" style="s2">going on is we are centuries to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:37.260" style="s2">millennia into a process of planetary</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.920" end="00:12:39.180" style="s2">collapse caused by human culture and</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.250" end="00:12:46.140" style="s2">and in the present but they only think</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.500" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">the remains is the human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.140" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">model to collapse as the last part of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:55.080" style="s2">and if we trigger a mass extinction</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:56.730" style="s2">event then we drive ourselves away - so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.080" end="00:12:58.350" style="s2">with this knowledge in perspective what</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.730" end="00:13:00.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing and a lot of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.350" end="00:13:02.400" style="s2">are doing is learning how to regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.360" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">landscapes and build regional skill</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.400" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">economies that function as living</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:09.300" style="s2">systems and that&#39;s something that we now</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.260" end="00:13:11.280" style="s2">have we fully have the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.300" end="00:13:12.570" style="s2">that a lot of the people are attempting</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.280" end="00:13:15.390" style="s2">it and there are a lot of great examples</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.570" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">out there in the world of people doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.390" end="00:13:19.470" style="s2">it right now and last year I was part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">a group called the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.470" end="00:13:24.570" style="s2">communities network which is a community</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.170" end="00:13:26.030" style="s2">of bio regional collaborative where</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.570" end="00:13:28.530" style="s2">people are learning how to create</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.030" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">regional scale or territorial scale</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.530" end="00:13:31.890" style="s2">economies</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:34.080" style="s2">for example the Hudson Valley in upstate</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.890" end="00:13:38.100" style="s2">New York or the food shed around Boulder</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.080" end="00:13:39.840" style="s2">Colorado or the OSA Peninsula in Costa</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.100" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">Rica which has two and a half percent of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.840" end="00:13:45.660" style="s2">the world&#39;s biodiversity and so on there</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">are models of people doing this at very</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.660" end="00:13:50.940" style="s2">large scales all over the world and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:52.830" style="s2">really hard work and it also can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.940" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">done unless we compost the global system</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.830" end="00:13:58.490" style="s2">which means the global system has to die</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:14:01.080" style="s2">so I&#39;ll stop here by summarizing our</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.490" end="00:14:04.530" style="s2">paraphrasing the words of Joanna Macy</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.080" end="00:14:07.050" style="s2">and just say our work is to be hospice</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.530" end="00:14:09.630" style="s2">workers and midwives and we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.050" end="00:14:11.430" style="s2">both at the same time and we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.630" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">it with the cumulative powers of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.430" end="00:14:16.860" style="s2">cultural evolution by then parrot by</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">quoting another friend of mine and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.860" end="00:14:21.750" style="s2">mentor David Sloan Wilson who says we</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:24.390" style="s2">need to become wise managers of our own</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.750" end="00:14:26.310" style="s2">evolutionary process so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.390" end="00:14:28.920" style="s2">understand our evolutionary how it works</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.310" end="00:14:30.930" style="s2">what mechanisms and dynamics are and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.920" end="00:14:33.960" style="s2">then we need to employ what the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.930" end="00:14:36.030" style="s2">wisdom we can using that word on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.960" end="00:14:37.770" style="s2">because most of that wisdom is in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.030" end="00:14:40.170" style="s2">indigenous cultures and not in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.770" end="00:14:43.320" style="s2">civilizations although not all of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.170" end="00:14:46.500" style="s2">there so that&#39;s not romanticize human</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.320" end="00:14:47.490" style="s2">systems that are real human systems but</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.500" end="00:14:49.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to learn from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.490" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">indigenous because most of them actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.530" end="00:14:54.750" style="s2">have been sustainable cultures in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:55.710" style="s2">caste and so I&#39;ll stop there because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.750" end="00:14:58.200" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna have a really rich</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.710" end="00:15:00.540" style="s2">conversation from this provocation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.200" end="00:15:03.330" style="s2">I&#39;m just excited to be here with all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.540" end="00:15:10.020" style="s2">you so thank you for letting me read for</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.330" end="00:15:11.340" style="s2">a few minutes so yeah if things are</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.020" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">coming up for people you can go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.340" end="00:15:16.140" style="s2">and put your question in the chat and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:18.360" style="s2">will call your name and you can ask your</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.140" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">question directly to Joe and I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.360" end="00:15:22.080" style="s2">warm drum up a little bit here so</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:26.220" style="s2">initially I would just like to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.080" end="00:15:29.340" style="s2">about the role of religion in all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.220" end="00:15:31.530" style="s2">this I think in the secular world we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.340" end="00:15:34.230" style="s2">seem to we struggle with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.530" end="00:15:36.900" style="s2">becoming religious even there&#39;s even an</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.230" end="00:15:39.330" style="s2">idea around the stove of like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.900" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">religion of no religion you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.330" end="00:15:43.110" style="s2">still grappling with this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:43.570" style="s2">religion what do you what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.110" end="00:15:45.460" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.570" end="00:15:49.660" style="s2">and what role does religion have to play</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.460" end="00:15:52.060" style="s2">in in earth regeneration there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.660" end="00:15:54.400" style="s2">really great book by a guy named Edward</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.060" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">goldsmith he&#39;s a cross cultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.400" end="00:15:59.170" style="s2">anthropologist and his book is called</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:01.930" style="s2">the stable society what he observed was</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.170" end="00:16:05.650" style="s2">that every stable society translation</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.930" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">every sustainable culture has Pro future</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.650" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">social norms embodied through religious</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:16.090" style="s2">practices that personify nature and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.010" end="00:16:17.830" style="s2">treated as sacred so the river is not an</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.090" end="00:16:19.900" style="s2">object the river as a person the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.830" end="00:16:22.510" style="s2">mountain is not an object the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.900" end="00:16:24.820" style="s2">is a person the bear is not an object</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.510" end="00:16:27.370" style="s2">the bear is a person and their kinship</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.820" end="00:16:30.640" style="s2">relationships that honor you the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.370" end="00:16:32.680" style="s2">the other being as sacred so if you look</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.640" end="00:16:34.780" style="s2">just with empirical evidence of human</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.680" end="00:16:38.380" style="s2">culture this has been an essential</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.780" end="00:16:41.110" style="s2">element of sustainability so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.380" end="00:16:44.140" style="s2">indigenous aspect of spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.110" end="00:16:46.510" style="s2">essential now the religion plays another</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.140" end="00:16:48.970" style="s2">important role that is beyond this and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.510" end="00:16:52.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll use the example of Bali and their</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.970" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">Sue box so sue box are basically nested</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.810" end="00:16:57.580" style="s2">areas of water and land management for</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.040" style="s2">terraced gardens where the terraced</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.580" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">gardens are mostly growing rice and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.040" end="00:17:03.640" style="s2">thing to know about the cereal box in</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">Bali is that they&#39;re structured as</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.640" end="00:17:09.939" style="s2">nested fractals around a series of or a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">network of different water temples and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.939" end="00:17:15.459" style="s2">these water temples have a religion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:17.470" style="s2">treating each piece of land in each of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.459" end="00:17:20.290" style="s2">the waterways as having its own spirit</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.470" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">or its own god or goddess and when</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.290" end="00:17:24.939" style="s2">people pay homage to the gods or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:26.890" style="s2">goddesses they are actually reporting</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.939" end="00:17:29.260" style="s2">and accounting the information they need</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.890" end="00:17:31.090" style="s2">for collectively and management and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.260" end="00:17:33.220" style="s2">that they have managed their water</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.090" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">system for more than 1,000 years at high</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.220" end="00:17:36.730" style="s2">levels of productivity without</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">destroying the water or the land</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.730" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">availability because of the cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">enabled by their religion so the big</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.380" end="00:17:48.570" style="s2">lesson for us from religion is that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:51.220" style="s2">is a way of recognizing how to bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.570" end="00:17:53.860" style="s2">cultural evolution to have cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.220" end="00:17:55.300" style="s2">occur at higher levels and to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.860" end="00:17:57.350" style="s2">functional at those higher levels you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.300" end="00:17:59.720" style="s2">can get a really strong group</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.350" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">election patterns and that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.720" end="00:18:04.130" style="s2">key thing about religions so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:06.260" style="s2">necessarily need to be structured as</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.130" end="00:18:09.350" style="s2">religions to do that but that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.260" end="00:18:12.220" style="s2">essential piece of villages so I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.350" end="00:18:17.270" style="s2">those are two answers to pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.220" end="00:18:18.650" style="s2">question great thank you and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.270" end="00:18:22.010" style="s2">gonna ask a question on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.650" end="00:18:24.500" style="s2">Benjamin as far as renewable materials</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.010" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">for sustaining civilizations what makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.500" end="00:18:30.200" style="s2">sense to cultivate what makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:33.770" style="s2">abandon well one thing we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.200" end="00:18:36.230" style="s2">at is the self renewing patterns of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.770" end="00:18:38.390" style="s2">earth that are at the planetary scale</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.230" end="00:18:41.030" style="s2">and this will start to give us some</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.390" end="00:18:42.530" style="s2">answers one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.030" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">measures we need to be aware of is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:47.330" style="s2">called net primary production which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:48.919" style="s2">if you look at the entire planet&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.330" end="00:18:51.380" style="s2">surface and add up all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.919" end="00:18:53.030" style="s2">photosynthesis that&#39;s happening then</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.380" end="00:18:55.309" style="s2">you&#39;ll get this measure of net primary</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.030" end="00:18:58.520" style="s2">production primary production as plant</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.309" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">biomass forming from photosynthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.520" end="00:19:03.350" style="s2">there are a lot of ecological reasons</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:06.140" style="s2">why that is a foundational capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.350" end="00:19:08.870" style="s2">any ecosystem the productivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.140" end="00:19:12.590" style="s2">plants is one of the Leben limiting</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.870" end="00:19:15.169" style="s2">factors of what the ecosystems can do so</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:17.870" style="s2">if we look at things like solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.169" end="00:19:19.370" style="s2">or wind turbines which have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.870" end="00:19:21.080" style="s2">non-renewable things in them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.370" end="00:19:23.059" style="s2">currently they require a lot of fossil</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.080" end="00:19:24.830" style="s2">fuels to make home and they&#39;re no it</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.059" end="00:19:27.140" style="s2">nothing close to a solution in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.830" end="00:19:29.690" style="s2">systemic way for these reasons there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.140" end="00:19:32.090" style="s2">another thing is we need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.690" end="00:19:37.429" style="s2">the resilience of food webs and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.090" end="00:19:39.080" style="s2">ecosystems to see that if we destroy in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.429" end="00:19:41.650" style="s2">touch forests and replace them with wind</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.080" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">turbines and collapse biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.650" end="00:19:45.500" style="s2">eventually we&#39;re going to trigger an</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:47.830" style="s2">extinction event and go away even though</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.500" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">we quote-unquote solved our energy needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.830" end="00:19:52.309" style="s2">the reason being that we converted too</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.690" end="00:19:55.630" style="s2">much of the land surface into machines</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.309" end="00:19:57.350" style="s2">primarily for human uses and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.630" end="00:20:00.409" style="s2">anthropocentrism was actually the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.350" end="00:20:03.950" style="s2">problem so so many look at materials</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.409" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">that have different limits we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.950" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">look at them in these two ways one is</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:09.560" style="s2">what are their total capacities like how</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.390" end="00:20:11.960" style="s2">much net primary</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.560" end="00:20:14.060" style="s2">there and then the other is what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.960" end="00:20:17.780" style="s2">their distributive qualities that allow</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.060" end="00:20:20.120" style="s2">them to be resilient so it&#39;s net primary</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.780" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">production or solar energy being turned</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.120" end="00:20:25.370" style="s2">into life is put into a brittle</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:27.590" style="s2">ecosystem very small biodiversity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.370" end="00:20:29.150" style="s2">primarily humans were you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.590" end="00:20:31.040" style="s2">domesticated animals for humans or</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.150" end="00:20:33.650" style="s2">whatever else then you have a fragile</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.040" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">system that can collapse and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.650" end="00:20:38.210" style="s2">question is answered both in the amount</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.970" style="s2">of the materials and their networking</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.210" end="00:20:42.940" style="s2">relationships and it&#39;s together that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.970" end="00:20:46.820" style="s2">see whether or not they&#39;re truly</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.940" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2">renewable so so this is important for</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.820" end="00:20:50.600" style="s2">metal or where you get the metal or by</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:53.620" style="s2">cutting down mountains and blowing them</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.600" end="00:20:55.790" style="s2">up with fossil fuels and destroying</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.620" end="00:20:57.980" style="s2">biodiversity and other things like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.790" end="00:21:00.020" style="s2">so so it&#39;s a really interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.980" end="00:21:02.780" style="s2">flip this conversation from how much of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.020" end="00:21:04.970" style="s2">the material is there to instead what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.780" end="00:21:07.820" style="s2">are the resilience patterns of network</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.970" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">connectivity and what are the disruption</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:13.700" style="s2">tolerances to those networks so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:15.020" style="s2">how much ore is available it&#39;s how much</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.700" end="00:21:17.630" style="s2">more can we take without destroying</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:19.580" style="s2">these ecosystems and most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.630" end="00:21:22.040" style="s2">contextualize the question in this way</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.580" end="00:21:25.300" style="s2">so it becomes a raw number and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.040" end="00:21:25.300" style="s2">really dangerous thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.029" end="00:21:33.149" style="s2">excellent thank you maybe gray would you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:38.730" style="s2">like to ask your question okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.149" end="00:21:42.330" style="s2">um I hear from you um an emphasis on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.730" end="00:21:45.570" style="s2">grief that there is to feel over what</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.330" end="00:21:47.429" style="s2">has already sort of occurred before we</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.570" end="00:21:49.799" style="s2">can really move forward with what has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.429" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">be done next I&#39;m wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.799" end="00:21:54.110" style="s2">talk a bit about how we can really</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:57.690" style="s2">appreciate the value of that work and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.110" end="00:21:59.490" style="s2">prioritize it yeah I have a specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.690" end="00:22:03.240" style="s2">perspective on this that I hope is</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.490" end="00:22:05.460" style="s2">helpful I mean it comes in two parts one</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.240" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">part is how ecological secession works</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:10.440" style="s2">which is that new life emerges by</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:12.330" style="s2">consuming the bodies of the dead so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:14.450" style="s2">have to have a way of celebrating death</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.330" end="00:22:16.950" style="s2">and have a healthy relationship to death</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.450" end="00:22:18.570" style="s2">no no I&#39;ll just let that stand it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.950" end="00:22:20.129" style="s2">of like a philosophical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.570" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot to say about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.129" end="00:22:25.110" style="s2">the other part that&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:28.350" style="s2">practical and tangible is that our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.110" end="00:22:31.379" style="s2">greatest capacity as human beings is our</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.350" end="00:22:35.159" style="s2">capacity to have empathy and then from</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.379" end="00:22:36.869" style="s2">the empathy to have nuance and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.159" end="00:22:38.730" style="s2">going to go into a degraded landscape</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.869" end="00:22:41.990" style="s2">like where I&#39;m living right now in</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.730" end="00:22:45.029" style="s2">Colombia we&#39;re in a tropical dry forest</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.990" end="00:22:47.460" style="s2">98% deforested so a lot of people would</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.029" end="00:22:49.049" style="s2">look at this as a dead landscape but if</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.460" end="00:22:51.330" style="s2">you&#39;re a sensitive person you&#39;ll pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.049" end="00:22:52.919" style="s2">attention to the patterns and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.330" end="00:22:54.749" style="s2">a sensitive person you&#39;ll notice where</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.919" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">life still exists but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.749" end="00:23:00.299" style="s2">sensitive person you will also be hurt</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:02.220" style="s2">by harm caused to life and so the grief</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.299" end="00:23:04.679" style="s2">that you have that gets converted into</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.220" end="00:23:08.309" style="s2">trauma is the numbing of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.679" end="00:23:10.950" style="s2">sensitivity and if that sensitivity is</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.309" end="00:23:13.049" style="s2">numb then you can&#39;t do permaculture you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.950" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">can&#39;t feel into and pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.049" end="00:23:17.340" style="s2">patterns and then help them grow so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.690" end="00:23:20.519" style="s2">have to get to a stage of grieving to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.340" end="00:23:24.629" style="s2">become sensitive again and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.519" end="00:23:25.799" style="s2">deeply deeply pragmatic and so on so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.629" end="00:23:27.809" style="s2">see this as one of the really essential</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.799" end="00:23:29.970" style="s2">things and there&#39;s also a part relating</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.809" end="00:23:31.860" style="s2">that&#39;s about letting go of control like</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.970" end="00:23:34.860" style="s2">we&#39;re in their community that&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.860" end="00:23:36.919" style="s2">to do permaculture led by children and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.860" end="00:23:38.580" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to build a regional skill</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.919" end="00:23:40.019" style="s2">regenerative power</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:42.779" style="s2">around children or set of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.019" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">around children to go out like we did</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.779" end="00:23:46.110" style="s2">this morning when we were digging water</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:48.269" style="s2">retention like little ponds and starting</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.110" end="00:23:49.710" style="s2">to build swales with our three-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.269" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">daughter playing with one of the tick</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.710" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">axes and digging in a hole with us we</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:55.940" style="s2">need to actually listen to the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.529" style="s2">of the children and again that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.940" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">about celebrating the joy of the future</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.529" end="00:24:01.830" style="s2">instead of being filled with anguish</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:04.620" style="s2">about the future those children are</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.830" end="00:24:07.159" style="s2">going to inherit and so the grieving</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.620" end="00:24:11.340" style="s2">gets in the way of all these processes</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.159" end="00:24:14.309" style="s2">it overwhelms our perception systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.340" end="00:24:16.260" style="s2">that we need to do the work well so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.309" end="00:24:19.320" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really important piece of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.260" end="00:24:20.789" style="s2">this a lot of other pieces too but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.320" end="00:24:23.639" style="s2">I&#39;ll just hold that one for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.789" end="00:24:30.750" style="s2">the conversation but I think it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.639" end="00:24:35.519" style="s2">important wonderful Darrell what do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.750" end="00:24:38.039" style="s2">like to ask you a question yes we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.519" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">seen blockchain do a lot of wild things</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.039" end="00:24:42.600" style="s2">with economies and probably not the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:46.230" style="s2">positive things but I do wonder do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.600" end="00:24:49.529" style="s2">see a role for blockchain to support the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.230" end="00:24:51.929" style="s2">creation of regenerative economies yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.529" end="00:24:53.429" style="s2">so I&#39;ll tell this story and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.929" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">roundabout way but you&#39;ll see its</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.429" end="00:24:57.299" style="s2">importance in a moment because this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">related to blockchain and hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.299" end="00:25:02.700" style="s2">and all the related body of technology</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.720" end="00:25:04.860" style="s2">work that people are doing and that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.700" end="00:25:07.169" style="s2">that a study just came out published in</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.860" end="00:25:08.940" style="s2">Nature by a group of researchers at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.169" end="00:25:11.730" style="s2">Santa Fe Institute it was published last</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.940" end="00:25:13.049" style="s2">week so it&#39;s very new and what they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.730" end="00:25:15.630" style="s2">do what they did is they looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.049" end="00:25:17.399" style="s2">sea shot world history databank which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.630" end="00:25:19.409" style="s2">an aggregation of archaeological and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.399" end="00:25:22.070" style="s2">anthropological work so they could do</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.409" end="00:25:23.880" style="s2">statistical analysis on human societies</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.070" end="00:25:26.510" style="s2">they looked at the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.880" end="00:25:29.789" style="s2">development for 291 political systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.510" end="00:25:31.940" style="s2">most of which collapsed and they noticed</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.789" end="00:25:34.440" style="s2">that there were two developmental stages</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.940" end="00:25:36.630" style="s2">for all of these societies and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.440" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">relates to your question the first one</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.630" end="00:25:40.380" style="s2">is once they established agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.750" style="s2">because they were looking at kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.380" end="00:25:45.000" style="s2">city-state development and beyond once</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.750" end="00:25:47.370" style="s2">they established agriculture the growth</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.000" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">in population drove the growth pattern</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.370" end="00:25:52.050" style="s2">and complexity pattern for the culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:54.270" style="s2">and this is uniform for all 291</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.050" end="00:25:57.630" style="s2">seiyya tease until they reached a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.270" end="00:25:59.400" style="s2">complexity information threshold where</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.630" end="00:26:01.800" style="s2">the complexity of their society became</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.400" end="00:26:04.920" style="s2">so great that if they did not invent</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.800" end="00:26:07.860" style="s2">tools for managing information they very</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.920" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">quickly collapsed whereas the second</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.860" end="00:26:11.610" style="s2">phase of development for a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:14.070" style="s2">these societies was all the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.610" end="00:26:16.950" style="s2">created things like accounting systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.070" end="00:26:18.930" style="s2">money and other things I could use</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.950" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">information to manage complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.930" end="00:26:23.790" style="s2">then from there you saw a diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:25.860" style="s2">further development where each polity</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.790" end="00:26:27.810" style="s2">developed differently but it was their</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.860" end="00:26:30.540" style="s2">capacity for processing information that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.810" end="00:26:32.370" style="s2">was important now yeah I think Darrell</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.540" end="00:26:34.920" style="s2">you probably know the connection but</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.370" end="00:26:36.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll make it really explicit what things</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.920" end="00:26:38.970" style="s2">like blockchain are doing for us is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.810" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">they&#39;re giving us a multivariable</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.970" end="00:26:43.530" style="s2">accounting system that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:45.660" style="s2">track multiple parameters at the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.530" end="00:26:47.910" style="s2">time so we can have very complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.660" end="00:26:50.310" style="s2">information about very complex patterns</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.910" end="00:26:51.960" style="s2">and this is going to be really important</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.310" end="00:26:54.090" style="s2">when we&#39;re regenerating it regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.960" end="00:26:55.740" style="s2">ecosystems and when we&#39;re building human</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.090" end="00:26:58.110" style="s2">economies that are integrating with them</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.740" end="00:26:59.580" style="s2">so one of the big challenges that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.110" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">happening in the world right now around</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.580" end="00:27:06.360" style="s2">regeneration is how to do valuation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.790" style="s2">risk management for investments for</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.360" end="00:27:10.020" style="s2">regenerative projects you know people</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.790" end="00:27:11.310" style="s2">from the investment world just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.020" end="00:27:14.370" style="s2">know how to value things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.310" end="00:27:15.690" style="s2">biodiversity and so what like the region</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.370" end="00:27:18.420" style="s2">network is trying to build some of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.690" end="00:27:20.790" style="s2">intermediate tools or they can use</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.420" end="00:27:22.980" style="s2">things like blockchain to track value</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.790" end="00:27:24.780" style="s2">creation across the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.980" end="00:27:27.240" style="s2">variables so that you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.780" end="00:27:29.940" style="s2">measure the value of it which allows</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.240" end="00:27:32.910" style="s2">people to manage risk for investment so</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.940" end="00:27:34.470" style="s2">this is one way that complexity can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.910" end="00:27:37.980" style="s2">managed that these tools are really</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.470" end="00:27:40.470" style="s2">important for and I see a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.980" end="00:27:44.550" style="s2">decentralization that is about to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.470" end="00:27:46.830" style="s2">emerged that allows scalability is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.550" end="00:27:49.350" style="s2">come from this blockchain in related</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.830" end="00:27:51.300" style="s2">technology space but I see it as really</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.350" end="00:27:54.060" style="s2">important for managing complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.300" end="00:27:57.180" style="s2">for discerning reality in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.060" end="00:27:58.830" style="s2">environments so I hope that answers the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.180" end="00:28:01.310" style="s2">question well enough I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.830" end="00:28:01.310" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.610" end="00:28:05.990" style="s2">thank you Paul</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.310" end="00:28:16.040" style="s2">hmm would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.110" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">I cannot I can ask for it</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.040" end="00:28:20.930" style="s2">sorry about that okay yeah I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">know I&#39;m you myself sorry about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.930" end="00:28:26.930" style="s2">yeah great stuff really enjoy this um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:28.790" style="s2">but you know and perhaps because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.930" end="00:28:31.820" style="s2">older and I&#39;ve experienced much more in</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.790" end="00:28:33.980" style="s2">life um we have an issue that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:36.590" style="s2">be addressed as well humans for</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.980" end="00:28:37.790" style="s2">centuries famila onion have gone to war</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.590" end="00:28:40.460" style="s2">against each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.790" end="00:28:42.620" style="s2">or resources mostly it&#39;s you know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.460" end="00:28:43.160" style="s2">tribe has what I want so we&#39;ll go and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.620" end="00:28:45.560" style="s2">take it</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.160" end="00:28:49.070" style="s2">chimpanzees do the same thing they&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.560" end="00:28:51.710" style="s2">to war for resources no matter how how</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.070" end="00:28:53.510" style="s2">in touch with nature they are in what</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.710" end="00:28:55.910" style="s2">kind of religions they have that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.510" end="00:28:58.610" style="s2">are they respect nature and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.910" end="00:29:01.190" style="s2">they still behave rather poorly against</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.610" end="00:29:04.600" style="s2">each other when when they desire</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.190" end="00:29:07.850" style="s2">another&#39;s resources how do we um</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.600" end="00:29:10.370" style="s2">overcome this because it&#39;s it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.850" end="00:29:14.060" style="s2">for these sociopathology that I&#39;m humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.370" end="00:29:18.170" style="s2">are I blessed with four cursed with we</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.060" end="00:29:20.870" style="s2">have this inside of us overcome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.170" end="00:29:22.850" style="s2">this is a fantastic question and one way</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.870" end="00:29:25.130" style="s2">to think about it is to take population</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.850" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">density and and increase the number</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.130" end="00:29:29.270" style="s2">until the threshold is reached and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:33.110" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that a scarcity pattern</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.270" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">will set in this is true with what</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.110" end="00:29:38.270" style="s2">chimpanzees for example they do this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:42.020" style="s2">a lot of animals do it humans do it too</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.270" end="00:29:44.990" style="s2">so the way we need to address this is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.020" end="00:29:47.480" style="s2">employ a specific insight that comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.990" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">from a study of evolutionary transitions</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.480" end="00:29:55.790" style="s2">and an evolutionary transition is when</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:59.680" style="s2">two previously separate living organisms</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.790" end="00:30:02.870" style="s2">or two or more that becomes a biotic</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.680" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">start to develop enough functional</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.870" end="00:30:06.620" style="s2">integration that they become</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:09.260" style="s2">interdependent and can no longer survive</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.620" end="00:30:11.420" style="s2">on their own the famous example of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.260" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">is mitochondria used to be a bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.420" end="00:30:15.920" style="s2">I was eaten by another bacteria sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.170" style="s2">lived in it&#39;s and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.920" end="00:30:20.900" style="s2">ancestral stomach but eventually they</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.170" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">became so codependent with each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.900" end="00:30:25.130" style="s2">an evolutionary transition occurred and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:27.320" style="s2">we went from prokaryotic cells to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.130" end="00:30:29.480" style="s2">eukaryotic cells or cells without</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.320" end="00:30:31.390" style="s2">organelles inside them to cells with</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.480" end="00:30:33.950" style="s2">organelles inside them and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.390" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">transition to functional interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.950" end="00:30:38.990" style="s2">is the key so the way I see this working</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:41.630" style="s2">for humans is we need to create bio</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.990" end="00:30:43.250" style="s2">regional economies that are organized</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.630" end="00:30:45.530" style="s2">around functions of landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.250" end="00:30:47.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like watersheds and mountain ranges</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.530" end="00:30:49.430" style="s2">and coastal estuaries and things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.210" end="00:30:52.820" style="s2">this and that we need to create trade</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.430" end="00:30:53.960" style="s2">and exchange between bioregions that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.820" end="00:30:56.270" style="s2">lead to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.960" end="00:30:58.400" style="s2">yes symbiogenesis is the name for this</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.270" end="00:31:02.300" style="s2">think you rose from the great work of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.400" end="00:31:03.830" style="s2">Lynn Margulis that this is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.300" end="00:31:05.240" style="s2">functional interdependence comes by</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.830" end="00:31:07.220" style="s2">intentionally designing for</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.240" end="00:31:08.810" style="s2">interdependence this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.220" end="00:31:13.070" style="s2">something that globalized economy has</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.810" end="00:31:15.740" style="s2">done really well what Brian Barber</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.070" end="00:31:17.510" style="s2">called the McDonald&#39;s effect just that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.740" end="00:31:19.280" style="s2">no two countries ever McDonald&#39;s go to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.510" end="00:31:22.010" style="s2">war and that&#39;s because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.280" end="00:31:23.630" style="s2">economically interdependent and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.010" end="00:31:25.850" style="s2">that insight is really important for</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.630" end="00:31:27.410" style="s2">regenerative economies do you create a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.850" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">great regenerative the economy in one</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.410" end="00:31:31.520" style="s2">place all you are is a potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:33.610" style="s2">invasion point for someone else who</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.520" end="00:31:36.650" style="s2">hasn&#39;t integrated with you in the future</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.610" end="00:31:38.330" style="s2">now I can say this is oh it&#39;s simple</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.650" end="00:31:40.250" style="s2">well I can say it any may sound like</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.330" end="00:31:41.930" style="s2">it&#39;s doable and not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.250" end="00:31:44.270" style="s2">this is gonna be really really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.930" end="00:31:47.450" style="s2">do but those of us who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.270" end="00:31:49.430" style="s2">build a planetary regeneration pathway</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.450" end="00:31:51.320" style="s2">need to know how to build this</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.430" end="00:31:53.210" style="s2">interdependence from one bio region to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.320" end="00:31:56.090" style="s2">another until they form a mesh network</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.210" end="00:31:58.520" style="s2">across the entire planet and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.090" end="00:32:01.130" style="s2">do this as we deal with overpopulation</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.520" end="00:32:03.380" style="s2">and scarcity of resources and I&#39;ll share</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.130" end="00:32:05.900" style="s2">another study that was one of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.380" end="00:32:07.370" style="s2">statistical overview studies that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.900" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">really damn depressing but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.370" end="00:32:13.070" style="s2">hold it in mind as there was a study</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:15.710" style="s2">using what&#39;s called the H RAF a database</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.070" end="00:32:18.730" style="s2">the human relation area files just</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.710" end="00:32:20.810" style="s2">hosted at Yale and it&#39;s a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.730" end="00:32:22.280" style="s2">anthropological and archaeological</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.810" end="00:32:24.140" style="s2">research for different cultures to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.280" end="00:32:26.300" style="s2">compare them with each other and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.140" end="00:32:30.050" style="s2">they did is they create a parameter</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.300" end="00:32:31.400" style="s2">measuring existential risk so like in</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.050" end="00:32:33.740" style="s2">each place where there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.400" end="00:32:34.840" style="s2">invasions from other cultures where</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.740" end="00:32:36.400" style="s2">there a lot of volcanoes</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.840" end="00:32:39.190" style="s2">earthquakes where is there a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.400" end="00:32:41.500" style="s2">extreme weather Nikola bulk measure of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.190" end="00:32:43.060" style="s2">existential risk and then what they did</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.500" end="00:32:44.680" style="s2">is they looked across history at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.060" end="00:32:46.570" style="s2">human cultures that were in the database</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.570" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">existential risk it naturally selects</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.000" end="00:33:06.040" style="s2">earth and so we are creating exactly the</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.040" end="00:33:10.420" style="s2">and fundamentalist religion in this time</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:14.590" style="s2">when we need to create interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.420" end="00:33:17.170" style="s2">bioregional economies so so easy to hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.590" end="00:33:18.580" style="s2">the paradox of this in mind that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.170" end="00:33:20.620" style="s2">actually entering in one of the worst</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">cooperation and interdependence and so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.800" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">think one of the keys is to ask the very</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:40.630" style="s2">question you asked Paul which is you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.970" style="s2">know this is a real pattern what do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.630" end="00:33:44.890" style="s2">do about it and we have to ask it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.970" end="00:33:47.110" style="s2">every one of our design questions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.890" end="00:33:48.820" style="s2">every project were working on or else</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.220" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">so we just need to be aware of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.260" end="00:33:59.560" style="s2">it&#39;s an extremely important question and</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.890" end="00:34:28.420" style="s2">form they become limiting factors for a</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.210" end="00:34:36.730" style="s2">and one of our problems now is that our</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.730" end="00:34:42.130" style="s2">systems are all deeply entrenched and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.390" end="00:34:44.140" style="s2">there&#39;s the need to go far enough away</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.130" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">from them that you can innovate without</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.140" end="00:34:48.580" style="s2">being pulled into their constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:51.790" style="s2">there&#39;s also a need to have a buffer</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.620" end="00:35:06.820" style="s2">of a group looking at existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.090" end="00:35:08.590" style="s2">and the group that he&#39;s a part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.820" end="00:35:10.810" style="s2">developed a specific measure it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.590" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">really interesting they observed that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.810" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a sweet spot of living between</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:16.930" style="s2">three and five hours away from an</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.930" end="00:35:20.500" style="s2">enough to benefit from the innovation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.550" end="00:35:22.350" style="s2">a city but far enough away to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.500" end="00:35:25.090" style="s2">buffered from its central connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.350" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2">and I&#39;m an example of this I&#39;m in body</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.090" end="00:35:29.380" style="s2">charter Columbia it&#39;s four hours to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.400" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">nearest airport and there have been zero</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.380" end="00:35:36.010" style="s2">cases of kovat here the big problem is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:38.350" style="s2">that they shut down all transport in and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.010" end="00:35:38.950" style="s2">out of the town and 80% of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.350" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">is tourism</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.950" end="00:35:43.780" style="s2">so they immediately killed the town&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:45.820" style="s2">economy but no one&#39;s dying from covered</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.780" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">so you can see that were in this place</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.820" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">we&#39;re in this town of about 5,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:54.010" style="s2">there are at least a couple hundred who</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.400" end="00:35:56.050" style="s2">have university degrees have worked in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.010" end="00:35:57.580" style="s2">bogota who have lived in other cities</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.050" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">but they came here because it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.580" end="00:36:01.540" style="s2">beautiful peaceful place in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:03.490" style="s2">mountains so we have captured or we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.540" end="00:36:06.220" style="s2">harnessed the creative and innovative</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.490" end="00:36:07.330" style="s2">potential of the city while buffering</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.220" end="00:36:10.300" style="s2">and protecting ourselves against</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.330" end="00:36:13.360" style="s2">collapse patterns and so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.300" end="00:36:16.330" style="s2">an interesting element of how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.360" end="00:36:18.190" style="s2">works for us another story I want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.330" end="00:36:20.590" style="s2">briefly tell is something from the work</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.190" end="00:36:22.390" style="s2">of Ernst Mayr for those you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.590" end="00:36:25.230" style="s2">him Ernst Mayr is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.390" end="00:36:28.450" style="s2">important biologists of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.230" end="00:36:30.700" style="s2">and it was well known in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.450" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">biology but not necessarily outside of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.700" end="00:36:36.760" style="s2">it and he wrote an essay that I read a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:39.070" style="s2">few years ago about the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.760" end="00:36:42.340" style="s2">novelty how does something truly new</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.070" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">emerge through evolution and he told the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.340" end="00:36:46.980" style="s2">story of lungs for amphibians because</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:49.570" style="s2">you know all of us land-dwellers</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.980" end="00:36:53.020" style="s2">emerge from fish or promotion dwellers</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.570" end="00:36:55.180" style="s2">so we had to go from gills to lungs it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.020" end="00:36:56.980" style="s2">turns out the way that lungs evolved was</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.180" end="00:36:59.500" style="s2">that there was a parallel redundant</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.980" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">system the fish could breathe with their</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.500" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">gills so their life supports were</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">there was strong natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.170" end="00:37:07.920" style="s2">against changing gills</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:10.890" style="s2">small tweaks to the gills kill the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.920" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">organism so don&#39;t mess with that but</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.890" end="00:37:14.940" style="s2">they had a lot of fish now these swim</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:17.150" style="s2">bladders that sort of fun like they</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.940" end="00:37:19.290" style="s2">function like really lousy lungs and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.150" end="00:37:22.020" style="s2">they could function like really lousy</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.290" end="00:37:24.330" style="s2">lungs for lots of generations gradually</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.020" end="00:37:27.060" style="s2">becoming more and more like lungs so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.330" end="00:37:29.610" style="s2">relaxing of evolutionary pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.060" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">select to select against change with</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.610" end="00:37:35.250" style="s2">parallel evolution is how novelty</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:37.710" style="s2">emerges so this is the role of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.250" end="00:37:40.350" style="s2">small towns these permaculture projects</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.710" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">yeah slack in the system exactly this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.350" end="00:37:45.330" style="s2">slack with in the evolutionary processes</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:47.430" style="s2">itself and the way we do this is by</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.330" end="00:37:50.990" style="s2">creating a structural decoupling and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.430" end="00:37:53.370" style="s2">buffering to protect the novel systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.990" end="00:37:55.310" style="s2">so there&#39;s not a lot of debt tying them</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.370" end="00:37:57.480" style="s2">down there&#39;s not a lot of short-term</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.310" end="00:37:59.540" style="s2">feedbacks that require them to respond</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.480" end="00:38:01.980" style="s2">to the other system there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.540" end="00:38:04.110" style="s2">leveraging from this old system that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.980" end="00:38:06.440" style="s2">will take the new system down with it if</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.110" end="00:38:08.790" style="s2">something goes wrong with the old system</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.440" end="00:38:11.700" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of room for creativity</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.790" end="00:38:13.380" style="s2">and failure which is extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.700" end="00:38:15.780" style="s2">and all of us who do innovation work</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.380" end="00:38:18.420" style="s2">know how important the ability to fail</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.780" end="00:38:21.710" style="s2">is so that I think this perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.420" end="00:38:24.570" style="s2">parallel evolution with redundancy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.710" end="00:38:28.310" style="s2">structural separation is really key to</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.260" end="00:39:53.910" style="s2">think there are high tech elements and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.690" end="00:39:56.730" style="s2">it&#39;s important to separate them from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.910" end="00:39:58.890" style="s2">high tech world to see their value one</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.730" end="00:40:01.860" style="s2">of them is biomimicry and material</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.890" end="00:40:05.160" style="s2">science but then to step back away from</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.860" end="00:40:06.660" style="s2">material science and and say well what</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.160" end="00:40:09.270" style="s2">happens when you have that much</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.660" end="00:40:11.570" style="s2">sophistication and biomimicry like when</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.270" end="00:40:14.610" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the molecular level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.570" end="00:40:16.410" style="s2">you know energy diffusion processes or</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.610" end="00:40:20.430" style="s2">whatever other things that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.410" end="00:40:23.369" style="s2">capacity or creativity that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.430" end="00:40:26.390" style="s2">powerful and when we tried to green our</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.369" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">supply change to remove toxins from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.390" end="00:40:32.250" style="s2">manufacturing materials and and other</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:34.770" style="s2">things related to you know distributed</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.250" end="00:40:36.690" style="s2">manufacturing I think there are two</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.770" end="00:40:38.940" style="s2">aspects of high tech one is the material</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.690" end="00:40:41.790" style="s2">science itself and the other one is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.940" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">information ecology the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.790" end="00:40:45.990" style="s2">information processes so think of like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:48.180" style="s2">million hacker makers spaces around the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.990" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">world with some kind of aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.180" end="00:40:52.770" style="s2">learning capacity across them could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:54.180" style="s2">extremely high tech even though a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.770" end="00:40:55.350" style="s2">the things they actually do are like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.180" end="00:40:59.100" style="s2">know taking a hammer and hang it on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.350" end="00:41:01.590" style="s2">piece of metal so it&#39;s a mix it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.100" end="00:41:04.710" style="s2">mix the other one which I saw named into</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.590" end="00:41:07.310" style="s2">the chat with drones is using remote</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.710" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">sensing information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.310" end="00:41:11.730" style="s2">specifically one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.250" style="s2">revolutions in human history which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.730" end="00:41:15.810" style="s2">what computer science really did</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.250" end="00:41:18.330" style="s2">computer science gave us the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.810" end="00:41:21.240" style="s2">run simulations of reality and explore</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.330" end="00:41:23.550" style="s2">reality using simulations we could do</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.240" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">computational modeling and computational</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.550" end="00:41:27.180" style="s2">modeling is why we have general</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.870" style="s2">circulation models there the u.s. clinic</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.180" end="00:41:32.050" style="s2">so like computational modeling is why</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.870" end="00:41:35.030" style="s2">of the field of the science of ecology</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.050" end="00:41:37.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s hugely important a very advanced</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.030" end="00:41:40.490" style="s2">science for computational modeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.480" end="00:41:43.190" style="s2">scientific visualization and information</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.490" end="00:41:45.020" style="s2">processing which includes satellite</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.190" end="00:41:47.240" style="s2">remote sensing and other kinds of remote</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.020" end="00:41:49.550" style="s2">sensing and the day to day analytics</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.240" end="00:41:52.190" style="s2">data storage data transfer and data</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.550" end="00:41:54.230" style="s2">processing tools so there&#39;s a huge room</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">for this because if we want to create</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.230" end="00:41:57.740" style="s2">homeostasis for the planet we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:41:59.750" style="s2">create something that functions like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.740" end="00:42:02.090" style="s2">this the cerebellum does in our brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.750" end="00:42:04.430" style="s2">and what the corpus callosum does in our</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.090" end="00:42:05.930" style="s2">brain the corpus callosum is the place</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.430" end="00:42:07.580" style="s2">where your left and right hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.930" end="00:42:10.250" style="s2">connect we&#39;ve done this with in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.580" end="00:42:12.680" style="s2">neocortex or within the whole cortex</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.250" end="00:42:13.880" style="s2">actually and it&#39;s the most dense range</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.680" end="00:42:15.950" style="s2">of connections because that&#39;s where all</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.880" end="00:42:18.050" style="s2">the global coherence of your brain comes</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.950" end="00:42:20.060" style="s2">about because of those deep connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.050" end="00:42:22.220" style="s2">in that part of your brain so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.060" end="00:42:24.290" style="s2">gonna create a corpus callosum for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.220" end="00:42:26.920" style="s2">planet then we&#39;re gonna do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.290" end="00:42:30.260" style="s2">high-tech information like information</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.920" end="00:42:31.730" style="s2">communication technology design and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.260" end="00:42:34.610" style="s2">blockchain and those other pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.730" end="00:42:37.220" style="s2">are I would say are subsets of that so</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.610" end="00:42:38.690" style="s2">really high tech information systems and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.220" end="00:42:43.270" style="s2">really high tech material science</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.690" end="00:42:46.040" style="s2">systems and I would say really high tech</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.270" end="00:42:47.930" style="s2">information creation systems and I call</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.040" end="00:42:49.700" style="s2">it that way to be general because or</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.930" end="00:42:51.890" style="s2">it&#39;s innate intelligence creation</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.700" end="00:42:53.210" style="s2">systems because intelligence doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.890" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">know what it&#39;s gonna create yet which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.210" end="00:42:58.100" style="s2">why it&#39;s sort of a catch-all word we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:00.410" style="s2">need ways of continuing to learn to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.100" end="00:43:02.570" style="s2">better at learning and looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.410" end="00:43:04.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve done with material science like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.570" end="00:43:06.020" style="s2">taking a you know a transmission</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.460" end="00:43:08.300" style="s2">electron microscope which is a piece for</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.020" end="00:43:10.850" style="s2">the ants technology and looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.300" end="00:43:13.460" style="s2">the surface of the eye for a fee fly</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.850" end="00:43:15.710" style="s2">works and then creating a material for</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.460" end="00:43:18.200" style="s2">high-altitude mountaineering this is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.710" end="00:43:21.250" style="s2">pretty freakin awesome thing and so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:24.740" style="s2">think that kind of high tech is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.250" end="00:43:26.390" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna remain important especially</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.740" end="00:43:29.990" style="s2">during the transition when we have such</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.390" end="00:43:31.670" style="s2">scarce resources you know during this</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.990" end="00:43:34.100" style="s2">next 50 years it&#39;s going to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.670" end="00:43:36.020" style="s2">important and it may become more</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.100" end="00:43:38.360" style="s2">low-tech after that and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.020" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">but I can&#39;t say for sure one way the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.360" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:50.290" style="s2">no great thank you so I&#39;m gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.930" end="00:43:53.900" style="s2">another question on behalf of Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.290" end="00:44:00.170" style="s2">do you see any role for artists in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.900" end="00:44:03.050" style="s2">movement all of us are artists yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.170" end="00:44:06.140" style="s2">absolutely let&#39;s talk about a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.050" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">kinds of art one kind of art that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.140" end="00:44:10.280" style="s2">think is really important and you really</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:12.619" style="s2">want to dig into this go look at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.280" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">writings of Peter Berg as he was writing</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.619" end="00:44:17.150" style="s2">about bio regionalism at the planet drum</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:20.180" style="s2">foundation is that a lot of bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.150" end="00:44:22.010" style="s2">cultures or Arts and Crafts cultures if</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.180" end="00:44:24.740" style="s2">you look on my wall right over here this</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.010" end="00:44:27.619" style="s2">is his mud packed housing as earthen</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.740" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">construction an artist built that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.619" end="00:44:31.730" style="s2">look at that roof where someone has</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:33.800" style="s2">taken Canas which is a real relative of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.730" end="00:44:35.690" style="s2">sugar cane and they&#39;ve treated it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.800" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">process it that&#39;s a woodworker that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.690" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">craftsmanship that&#39;s an artist we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:43.010" style="s2">stone workers we have pottery we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:45.859" style="s2">basket weavers because I&#39;m in Andes</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.010" end="00:44:48.500" style="s2">they&#39;re all these kind of ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.859" end="00:44:51.079" style="s2">indigenous craft skills a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.500" end="00:44:53.510" style="s2">bioregional economics is about craft</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.079" end="00:44:56.690" style="s2">skills and you develop crafts with arts</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.510" end="00:44:58.369" style="s2">and crafts mindsets so just in that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:45:00.220" style="s2">you can see we&#39;re building an economy on</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.369" end="00:45:03.230" style="s2">arts and crafts it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.220" end="00:45:05.630" style="s2">foundational another way that arts and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.230" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">crafts that or that art plays a role and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.630" end="00:45:08.500" style="s2">I really found in a really important way</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">is in meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.500" end="00:45:16.910" style="s2">which has to do with songs and in poetry</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:18.770" style="s2">and how they can give us give us social</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.910" end="00:45:20.390" style="s2">context to express our feelings when</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.770" end="00:45:22.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not otherwise able to express them</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.390" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">to bring us together in ceremonial and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.520" end="00:45:27.470" style="s2">ritualistic ways to form human bonds to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">commiserate something being well done</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.470" end="00:45:32.030" style="s2">which gets not the craftsmanship of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">fermentation like having beer and wine</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.030" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">both of which are fermented beverages</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:38.599" style="s2">that actually having parties and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">festivals and doing theater and using</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.599" end="00:45:43.880" style="s2">them to tell our stories and to use them</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:45.020" style="s2">as like cultural seed banks you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.880" end="00:45:47.059" style="s2">think of William Shakespeare as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.020" end="00:45:48.859" style="s2">cultural sink seedbank of the 17th</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.059" end="00:45:51.290" style="s2">century in the 16th century</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.859" end="00:45:54.200" style="s2">we have those plays to reenact the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.290" end="00:45:55.859" style="s2">stories of those people at that time it</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.200" end="00:45:59.819" style="s2">was the screenwriters who did</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.859" end="00:46:01.499" style="s2">and so so you can see various ways that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.819" end="00:46:04.980" style="s2">artists can play roles in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.499" end="00:46:06.930" style="s2">and one of the more important ways that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.980" end="00:46:09.930" style="s2">they can help that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.930" end="00:46:12.089" style="s2">right now is to help us dream bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.930" end="00:46:14.670" style="s2">to dream more realistically because</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.089" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">right now we have entirely dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.670" end="00:46:18.630" style="s2">futures and all of our superhero movies</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">it&#39;s catastrophic what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.630" end="00:46:22.140" style="s2">the film industry</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:24.390" style="s2">just how much regurgitated shit is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.140" end="00:46:25.799" style="s2">coming out of the film industry even</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.390" end="00:46:27.989" style="s2">though we have some of some of the best</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.799" end="00:46:30.089" style="s2">educated and best trained storytellers</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.989" end="00:46:33.390" style="s2">that history has because so many people</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.089" end="00:46:35.640" style="s2">now to do a well and so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.390" end="00:46:38.759" style="s2">direct our storytelling toward emotional</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.640" end="00:46:41.279" style="s2">processing of grief as maybe now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.759" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2">talking about a few minutes ago and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.279" end="00:46:46.619" style="s2">that we can imagine different futures</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:48.119" style="s2">you know what I am in buddy Choi</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.619" end="00:46:51.170" style="s2">everyone&#39;s worried about water because</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.119" end="00:46:53.549" style="s2">we&#39;re running out of water here but</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.170" end="00:46:56.670" style="s2">almost no one knows what to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.549" end="00:46:59.039" style="s2">they don&#39;t how to imagine it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.670" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">know that you know building ponds and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.039" end="00:47:02.519" style="s2">planting trees will bring water back</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:04.890" style="s2">they can&#39;t imagine it they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.519" end="00:47:07.049" style="s2">how so our storytellers can help them</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.890" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">imagine better and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.049" end="00:47:12.180" style="s2">really important thing to do right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:17.039" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple couple of pieces so</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.180" end="00:47:20.989" style="s2">arts very important ok thank you and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.039" end="00:47:24.390" style="s2">want to get a question into right now so</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.989" end="00:47:26.279" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about overpopulation so</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.390" end="00:47:28.019" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about the decision to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.279" end="00:47:30.839" style="s2">become a parent how do you view</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.019" end="00:47:33.539" style="s2">parenting how do you view educating of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.839" end="00:47:35.400" style="s2">children whenever I found that for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.539" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">little bit for me yeah yeah I just gave</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.400" end="00:47:39.749" style="s2">a webinar on parenting for our three</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:42.359" style="s2">generation last week and we have a three</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.749" end="00:47:45.539" style="s2">and a half year old daughter and the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.359" end="00:47:47.400" style="s2">that I am addressed this question in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.539" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">webinar I gave was I said the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.400" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">the question should we how should you</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.200" end="00:47:52.829" style="s2">have children or should anyone have</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:55.349" style="s2">children the answer is an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.829" end="00:47:56.999" style="s2">question the ethical question is or</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.349" end="00:47:59.640" style="s2">humans good for the planet or bad for</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.999" end="00:48:01.559" style="s2">the planet and notice that&#39;s based in</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.640" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">belief and not based in reality because</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.559" end="00:48:05.249" style="s2">some humans are good for the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:07.710" style="s2">some humans are very obviously bad for</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.249" end="00:48:09.270" style="s2">the planet so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not simply</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.710" end="00:48:10.620" style="s2">one or the other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.270" end="00:48:13.260" style="s2">what do you believe and then what do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.620" end="00:48:16.290" style="s2">choose to enact and so what I feel in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.260" end="00:48:19.410" style="s2">time of overpopulation is that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.290" end="00:48:20.850" style="s2">who chooses to have children needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.410" end="00:48:23.490" style="s2">responsible for raising their children</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.850" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">to be net positive for the planet - the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:28.410" style="s2">best thing that they can and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.150" style="s2">a natural requirement so they&#39;re minutes</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.410" end="00:48:32.070" style="s2">time if they&#39;re aware of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.150" end="00:48:34.080" style="s2">they&#39;re either being selfish for doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.070" end="00:48:35.360" style="s2">it or they&#39;re being reckless because</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.080" end="00:48:38.490" style="s2">they&#39;re placing their child in danger</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.360" end="00:48:41.390" style="s2">because the next you know few decades</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.490" end="00:48:44.130" style="s2">are going to be pretty difficult and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.390" end="00:48:46.920" style="s2">what I think of in terms of parenting</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.130" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">and the the regenerative practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.920" end="00:48:51.870" style="s2">related to parenting is some of us</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:54.990" style="s2">really simple let kids play outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.870" end="00:48:57.390" style="s2">give them unstructured time teach them</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.990" end="00:48:59.220" style="s2">arts and crafts teach them social and</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.390" end="00:49:01.650" style="s2">emotional skills you know like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.220" end="00:49:04.110" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty basic but then there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.650" end="00:49:06.270" style="s2">specific things that like my wife and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.110" end="00:49:08.190" style="s2">made the decision that we wanted our</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.270" end="00:49:10.410" style="s2">daughter to feel like it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.190" end="00:49:13.350" style="s2">normal everyone around her regenerates</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.410" end="00:49:14.940" style="s2">landscapes so we need to live in a place</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.350" end="00:49:17.700" style="s2">where that&#39;s happening and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.940" end="00:49:19.050" style="s2">help that happen so our daughter is 3</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.700" end="00:49:21.050" style="s2">and a half and she&#39;s learning about</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.050" end="00:49:23.580" style="s2">water retention reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.050" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">identifying native plants and other</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.580" end="00:49:27.840" style="s2">things like this because that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:30.210" style="s2">what people do and it&#39;s normative we</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.840" end="00:49:31.770" style="s2">want it to be her social one I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.210" end="00:49:33.270" style="s2">that regenerative parenting is around</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.770" end="00:49:36.180" style="s2">building these these normative</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.270" end="00:49:40.050" style="s2">expectations the other thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.180" end="00:49:42.990" style="s2">need to do as parents is cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.050" end="00:49:45.900" style="s2">really powerful complexity management</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.990" end="00:49:47.310" style="s2">skills like think of kids that do Improv</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.900" end="00:49:49.170" style="s2">Theater or anyone who does in front</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.310" end="00:49:51.330" style="s2">Peter where it learns mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.170" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">meditation practices they need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.330" end="00:49:55.140" style="s2">flexibility to adapt and update their</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:57.240" style="s2">thinking they need to have a high</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.140" end="00:50:00.780" style="s2">tolerance for uncertainty and they need</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.240" end="00:50:01.980" style="s2">to work really well in teams and so this</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.780" end="00:50:04.530" style="s2">is going to be really important for</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.980" end="00:50:06.660" style="s2">parenting and then a third thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.530" end="00:50:09.090" style="s2">think is really important is parents</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.660" end="00:50:11.250" style="s2">themselves need to become students which</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.090" end="00:50:13.250" style="s2">is we need to learn how to be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.250" end="00:50:16.650" style="s2">regenerative with our children</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.250" end="00:50:18.150" style="s2">oftentimes led by our children we find</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.650" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">ways for our children to get education</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.150" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">that then we participate in and we learn</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:24.559" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:28.339" style="s2">one of the things that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.559" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">is we need to undo a great mistake the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.339" end="00:50:32.569" style="s2">great mistake was this pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:35.450" style="s2">civilization has destroyed and killed</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.569" end="00:50:37.309" style="s2">most indigenous cultures on earth so</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.450" end="00:50:39.950" style="s2">every human being alive today is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.309" end="00:50:42.589" style="s2">descendant of indigenous people but most</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.950" end="00:50:45.650" style="s2">of us don&#39;t remember it most of us at</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.589" end="00:50:49.190" style="s2">our ancestral lines cut off and so our</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.650" end="00:50:51.019" style="s2">descendants when we become ancestors we</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.190" end="00:50:53.960" style="s2">need to begin the process of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.019" end="00:50:56.690" style="s2">indigenous for and for our descendants</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.960" end="00:50:57.740" style="s2">to be the future indigenous and so as</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.690" end="00:50:59.750" style="s2">our children get these learning</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.740" end="00:51:03.529" style="s2">opportunities we get to practice being</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.750" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">indigenous and so means we participate</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.529" end="00:51:07.130" style="s2">in these practices as adults as our</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.869" style="s2">children are doing it and most of us</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.130" end="00:51:11.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do it so we learn</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.869" end="00:51:14.269" style="s2">right beside them which by the way I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.210" end="00:51:15.769" style="s2">attest it&#39;s my daughter and my wife or a</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.269" end="00:51:18.619" style="s2">play or in the other room making a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.769" end="00:51:21.470" style="s2">natural play dough with our neighbor how</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.619" end="00:51:24.049" style="s2">much fun it is to learn to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.470" end="00:51:26.359" style="s2">regenerative with your children so this</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.049" end="00:51:28.759" style="s2">is actually a pretty awesome waste but</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.359" end="00:51:32.059" style="s2">those are a couple of the key pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.759" end="00:51:35.210" style="s2">it really important parenting is a big</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.059" end="00:51:36.789" style="s2">part of this thank you and then I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.210" end="00:51:39.009" style="s2">to get in this last question from Raya</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.789" end="00:51:43.069" style="s2">would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.009" end="00:51:45.529" style="s2">sure thanks Raven and Thank You Jo I am</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.069" end="00:51:47.299" style="s2">just so resonant with how much emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.529" end="00:51:49.130" style="s2">you have on indigenous cultures because</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.299" end="00:51:51.799" style="s2">when you start to study the stories and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.130" end="00:51:53.750" style="s2">the mythology it&#39;s so obvious like their</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.799" end="00:51:57.039" style="s2">connection to the earth and how they</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.750" end="00:52:00.470" style="s2">celebrated it and respected it and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.039" end="00:52:02.150" style="s2">think as a global society we&#39;ve them</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.470" end="00:52:05.000" style="s2">from the majority we&#39;ve really lost</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.150" end="00:52:07.220" style="s2">touch to that and so my question is like</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.000" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">how do we guide or inspire the human</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.220" end="00:52:11.750" style="s2">race back to that indigenous inspired</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:13.670" style="s2">connection to the earth and do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.750" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">believe that we have the actual capacity</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.670" end="00:52:20.690" style="s2">as a global society to live harmoniously</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:23.089" style="s2">and synergistically with the planet we</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.690" end="00:52:25.759" style="s2">don&#39;t have the global society what we do</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.089" end="00:52:28.490" style="s2">as planetary system Anna teri citizens</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.759" end="00:52:31.480" style="s2">of bioregional societies as all</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.490" end="00:52:33.740" style="s2">indigenous cultures are bioregional and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.480" end="00:52:35.550" style="s2">so I think that that&#39;s the key because</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.740" end="00:52:38.730" style="s2">we can still be planetary and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.550" end="00:52:42.090" style="s2">awareness but we have to be regional you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.730" end="00:52:43.410" style="s2">know with our own landscapes I have some</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.090" end="00:52:46.410" style="s2">friends that are doing really awesome</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.410" end="00:52:49.530" style="s2">work it&#39;s Cassandra Ferreira Zoe Wilde</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.410" end="00:52:50.940" style="s2">and Jennifer monkey who are three women</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.530" end="00:52:52.920" style="s2">that each worth work with different</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.940" end="00:52:55.830" style="s2">wisdom traditions and all of them are</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.920" end="00:52:58.440" style="s2">working with land regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.830" end="00:52:59.940" style="s2">cooperatively and ownership and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.440" end="00:53:02.850" style="s2">have been developing something that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.940" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">call the sacred contract which is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.850" end="00:53:07.650" style="s2">confusing in a way because the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:09.240" style="s2">contract is actually a relationship you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.650" end="00:53:11.820" style="s2">cultivate over time more than</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.240" end="00:53:14.910" style="s2">specifically a contract but the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.820" end="00:53:16.950" style="s2">how to help people begin to become</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.910" end="00:53:19.560" style="s2">indigenous by feeling a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.950" end="00:53:21.300" style="s2">connection to their land so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.560" end="00:53:23.880" style="s2">someone who has a piece of land there</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.300" end="00:53:25.890" style="s2">are simple things like find the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.880" end="00:53:28.350" style="s2">tree on your land and then here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.890" end="00:53:31.580" style="s2">simple ceremony and from that ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.350" end="00:53:34.050" style="s2">start to feel how precious that tree is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.580" end="00:53:35.910" style="s2">and so there are activities like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.050" end="00:53:37.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s just a nice concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.910" end="00:53:39.180" style="s2">or if you live in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.380" end="00:53:41.700" style="s2">indigenous people still exist they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.180" end="00:53:43.910" style="s2">First Nations people invite them onto</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.700" end="00:53:46.560" style="s2">the land and do a reclamation process</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.910" end="00:53:48.060" style="s2">ask for their blessing for regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.560" end="00:53:51.690" style="s2">the land ask for their wisdom and their</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.060" end="00:53:54.210" style="s2">guidance and and show your humility as</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.690" end="00:53:56.790" style="s2">someone from the colonizer culture which</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.210" end="00:53:58.710" style="s2">will give us access to trust based</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.790" end="00:54:00.870" style="s2">relationships to build a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.710" end="00:54:02.940" style="s2">relationship to the land and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.870" end="00:54:04.920" style="s2">Cassandra Zoe and Jennifer have been</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.940" end="00:54:08.340" style="s2">developing this as a way of helping</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.920" end="00:54:10.980" style="s2">people make land purchasing decisions so</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.340" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">if someone wants to buy land they might</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.980" end="00:54:15.180" style="s2">put a deed restriction they might put it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:16.890" style="s2">into a Community Land Trust they might</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.180" end="00:54:18.870" style="s2">create an eco village or an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.890" end="00:54:21.500" style="s2">community but if they don&#39;t go through</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.870" end="00:54:23.580" style="s2">this process of making the land sacred</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.500" end="00:54:25.800" style="s2">then they don&#39;t know how to legally</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.580" end="00:54:27.660" style="s2">protect the land and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.800" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">cultivating the cultural capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.660" end="00:54:33.240" style="s2">protect the land and so on so I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:35.340" style="s2">this is how we do it it is by forming</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.240" end="00:54:37.620" style="s2">intimate relationships body-based</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.340" end="00:54:42.660" style="s2">relationships with the land that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.620" end="00:54:45.570" style="s2">on and when we do that it&#39;s amazing how</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.660" end="00:54:48.470" style="s2">how apt how capable humans are feeling</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.570" end="00:54:50.420" style="s2">the sacred and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.470" end="00:54:53.210" style="s2">so even those of us who have been like</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.420" end="00:54:54.950" style="s2">PTSD for decades will be surprised by</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.210" end="00:54:57.590" style="s2">the healing power of touching the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.950" end="00:54:59.750" style="s2">tree on their land and weeping that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.590" end="00:55:02.390" style="s2">tree is not old enough maybe the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.750" end="00:55:03.530" style="s2">tree is 20 years old and just think like</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.390" end="00:55:07.609" style="s2">how painful that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.530" end="00:55:09.349" style="s2">and so like so that opening up is I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.609" end="00:55:12.020" style="s2">think is how we do it through these very</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.349" end="00:55:14.660" style="s2">simple practices and we do it as locally</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.020" end="00:55:17.330" style="s2">as possible so that you can walk back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.660" end="00:55:23.690" style="s2">that place anytime and reestablish the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.330" end="00:55:28.940" style="s2">connection great that was beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.690" end="00:55:31.640" style="s2">thank you Joe where where ways we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.940" end="00:55:33.020" style="s2">reach you or what are things how can we</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.640" end="00:55:37.420" style="s2">get involved in projects that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.020" end="00:55:39.770" style="s2">doing and stuff like that well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.420" end="00:55:42.500" style="s2">I&#39;m actually very intentionally trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.770" end="00:55:44.570" style="s2">to remove psychological shadow patterns</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.500" end="00:55:46.609" style="s2">from my life because I have a long</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.570" end="00:55:49.940" style="s2">history of being like a flame that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.609" end="00:55:52.970" style="s2">attracts narcissistic moths and and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.940" end="00:55:54.560" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to promote my work what</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.970" end="00:55:57.500" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do is promote Gaia&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.560" end="00:55:59.480" style="s2">as much as I can and there is a project</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.500" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">I&#39;m involved in what that has come into</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.480" end="00:56:03.890" style="s2">being through this mind set which is we</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:06.859" style="s2">have a study group called Earth</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.890" end="00:56:09.710" style="s2">regenerators which is hosted on a mobile</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.859" end="00:56:11.990" style="s2">app called mighty networks and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.710" end="00:56:14.060" style="s2">really powerful app for hosting online</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.990" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">courses but I&#39;m giving a three version</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.060" end="00:56:18.859" style="s2">it&#39;s in the spirit of the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.810" style="s2">there are three generators now I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.859" end="00:56:22.700" style="s2">like 1300 members and it&#39;s only four and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.810" end="00:56:26.900" style="s2">a half months old I was just becoming</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.700" end="00:56:28.580" style="s2">something pretty cool and its structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.900" end="00:56:30.349" style="s2">is around what I want people to be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.580" end="00:56:33.109" style="s2">part of which is how do we learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.349" end="00:56:35.480" style="s2">see the design pathway for regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.109" end="00:56:37.700" style="s2">the entire planet by regenerating the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.480" end="00:56:40.099" style="s2">landscapes that make our own lives</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.700" end="00:56:41.810" style="s2">possible where does our water come from</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.099" end="00:56:43.160" style="s2">where does our food come from where do</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.810" end="00:56:45.770" style="s2">all of our building materials come from</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.160" end="00:56:47.720" style="s2">etc how do we connect to our land and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.770" end="00:56:50.210" style="s2">then how can we change those</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.720" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">relationships in a coordinated and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.210" end="00:56:55.790" style="s2">nested fashion so that it scales up to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:58.040" style="s2">planetary health and so the earth</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.790" end="00:56:59.630" style="s2">regenerators study group is a place of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.040" end="00:57:02.020" style="s2">learning for us to all figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.630" end="00:57:04.990" style="s2">together and everyone is invited</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.020" end="00:57:06.490" style="s2">but um what I care about even more than</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.990" end="00:57:06.910" style="s2">that is go find that old tree on your</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.490" end="00:57:09.130" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.910" end="00:57:11.410" style="s2">you know like I&#39;m do the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.130" end="00:57:12.940" style="s2">work in yourself and don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.410" end="00:57:14.770" style="s2">doing it with me unless you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.940" end="00:57:16.810" style="s2">drawn to something that yes because</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.770" end="00:57:18.540" style="s2">you&#39;re specifically meeting that happens</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.810" end="00:57:22.540" style="s2">to be in the space that I&#39;m holding</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.540" end="00:57:24.100" style="s2">because too many egos are get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.540" end="00:57:27.369" style="s2">of this work right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.100" end="00:57:30.310" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll just need to get to it but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.369" end="00:57:34.030" style="s2">just feel really honored and blessed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.310" end="00:57:35.890" style="s2">be a conduit for this conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.030" end="00:57:40.510" style="s2">this time when we all need to be doing</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.460" end="00:58:09.580" style="s2">surrounds it is like an energy of shame</p>
