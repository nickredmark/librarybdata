<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">um continuity there is an interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">in inner life</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">and you know you can see in</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">explicit spiritual ways explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2">theistic ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">the idea that the kind of empirical the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">um it just kind of well certainly just</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">one dimension if not</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">a surface reflection of deeper things</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">i got into the church as a clergy person</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">in the anglican church</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">and um most because i didn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">the imagination i think to think</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">um i come from a church family</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">i as it were i enjoyed theology a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">and i then found off as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">priest in a parish i kind of had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">i realized that um</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">of entity unto itself and it works for</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t work for increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">numbers of people it seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">certainly in this country um and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">realized it didn&#39;t really work for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">um it&#39;s life didn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">be really find that inner life that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">at the time when i left i was left i did</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">it what they call accuracy which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">bob um i had a crisis that was both</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">intellectual and personal and i got very</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">lonely</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">and in respect can see now i had a sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">of slow</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">and breakdown of in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">job that i thought was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">but left me in a meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">um so i left and um first i thought that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">i was leaving</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">being the fresh air of the enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">that had seen through</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">suspicious nonsense that is guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">not all of religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">but i well two things happened one was i</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">would never quite put down the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">things so you know i&#39;d walk into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">cathedral and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">it would um it would just not seem</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">adequate to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">something like you know these buildings</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">put up</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">by the excesses of human folly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">fantasy you know they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">feel like they were just folly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">fantastic if</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">things just don&#39;t really last thousands</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">of years i think if they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">um and then also um</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">in pursuing a kind of uh where am i</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">gonna find meaning now</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">i ended up doing a hd on potato</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">and um that left me very</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">um by the figure of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">can i interrupt for a second we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">getting a bit of choppiness uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">from you i don&#39;t know if you can adjust</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">your mic or</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">uh maybe move closer to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">um yes if i if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">maybe just move a bit closer to it i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">hope that might make a difference but do</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">interject again if</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">just um that&#39;s sounding a bit better now</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s sounding better um</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">yeah so i um i did this phd on plato and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">um i in retrospect doing the phd i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">really helped me understand what plato</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">was really driving at</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">um but i did get very enamored with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">figure of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">this idea that the one thing he knew all</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:05:01.880" style="s2">was that nothing for sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">um and that made me interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.880" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">agnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">um and hence that you mentioned there</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">and diagnosis don&#39;t mean kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know and it doesn&#39;t matter i</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">but much more how the edges of what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">um absolute most important parts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">what we do and don&#39;t know and because</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">then we might step into</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">a much wider and bigger world and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s what socrates was really on</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">there&#39;s still a kind of even in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">agnosticism as it were it&#39;s still driven</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">interest in inner life and what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">missing</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">um from empirical scientific perception</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve ended up writing this book</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">on christianity</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">i feel a bit nervous about being called</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">a christian because that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">so many things to so many different</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">people and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">usually it&#39;s meant to kind of put you in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">a box um</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">and i i ended up reading this chap owen</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.759" style="s2">barfield</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">who and was one of the inklings and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.759" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">great friend of c.s lewis and j.r</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">tolkien</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">and um he finally made help me make</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">thought first of all of plato and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">hence a sense of the christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">i felt much more aligned and now</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">i could go on about that at great length</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">but um that&#39;s something about the kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">lecture journey at least so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">you you eventually came to came across</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">john verveigh</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">how did so how did you come to know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">john&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">how does it intersect with your own</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">yeah well i&#39;m i i have i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">interested in a number of people online</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">who are pursuing these questions of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">and john&#39;s long series on the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">interesting for its own sake and to run</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">through all that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">um but then i was really surprised when</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">he had at least one half</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">episode on owen barfield there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">few people</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">oh barfield let alone want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">him um</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">so i emailed him john and said you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">it was a great</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">joy to go and barfield disgust um if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">don&#39;t mind me saying so i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">um you completely got it right but</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">really important stuff here um and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">said i&#39;ve written a book</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">that tells the story of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">using barfield&#39;s insights</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">which is a secret history of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">christianity um and he was very</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">interested in that and so we had the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">first conversation which was probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">around barfield</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">and then i&#39;m now also involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">research project based at cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">also a think tank called perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s a project looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">spiritual intelligence might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">and particularly as distinct from say</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">and so john was interested in that as</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">well and i&#39;m very interested in his</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">um or e cognitive science reaching</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">out in much more expansive directions</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">the second conversation we have was</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">aimed around uh spiritual intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:20.520" style="s2">and so your your no so your secret</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">history i mean it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.520" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">conspiratorial type book just from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">title but but it but it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re talking about an approach</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">to to studying</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">christianity is that that right yes so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">it&#39;s secret as</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">in um not immediately self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">um and it comes from jesus actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">jesus talked about the secrets of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:47.279" style="s2">and i think what he really was meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">there is that what he stood for</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.279" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">was cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">a very different perception of life and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">what it was all about</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">um and perception of life that requires</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">shift of consciousness um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">when that shift of consciousness happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">either in disease or</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">and maybe in larger steps and realize</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">that it was there all along</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">and but it was kind of hidden like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">secret treasure as a beneath your feet</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what i mean by the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">i wanted it to have a slight sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">intrigue because i think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">have that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">am i going to discover something i</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t even really suspect</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">get that shift of consciousness if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to be just the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">rearrangement of what you know already</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">that shifted consciousness will never</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">happen um but</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">it has got these other connotations um</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">as well which i don&#39;t know whether that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">puts people off or not but anyway i took</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">the gamble</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">so we we have uh we&#39;ve got a question</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">from stroon who&#39;s uh who&#39;s i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">his audio&#39;s choppy so i&#39;m gonna read it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">uh how does plato&#39;s views and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">relate to his views on virtue</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">and how does that position relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">overall value of the platonic dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">given that plato thought you could only</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">have real knowledge of what was eternal</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">and unchanging</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">yes so um this is uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">referring to one of the attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">summarize</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">any well even socrates origin virtue</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">the historical socrates perhaps wondered</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">about this too</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">um but um plato certainly talks about</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">and what did the idea is that you only</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">really know what you resonate with um</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">scientific knowledge um actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">um verified</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">exceptional kind of knowledge in that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">seems to be objective</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">um so who you are in principle</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:53.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">scientific knowledge is it where</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">anyone can look at the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">and in principle understand it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">just in parenthesis my first degree was</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">actually a physic</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">and i realized now that degree in</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">physics is essentially an initiation</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">process to see whether you can really</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">physics and so in fact you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">quite a lot to fix to have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">get a hang of abstract um objective</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">mathematical approaches</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">to um by being reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">oh actually i think the way you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">be able to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">reality even as a scientist really to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">a good scientist</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">um but nonetheless plato was very clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">um when you really know what and felt</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">or intuitive or um participative</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">connection with so if reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">up to the chase that rather simply if</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">is the base goods beautiful and true</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">and have at least something of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">good what&#39;s beautiful and true in you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">really know it directly and otherwise no</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">amount of telling</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">will persuade you i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">indifferent or maybe even think it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">so you have to work on yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">cultivate the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">be what&#39;s good and true and which the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">shorthand word for would be the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">um so virtues are kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">qualities or characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">um that become part of who you are um</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">and you know i think there&#39;s no nothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:34.320" style="s2">very amazing about this you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">fall in love with someone</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.320" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">that lovingly or to them they act</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">lovingly was you</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">he sides of them that perhaps even no</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">one else see</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">and so we know i think even in our</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">everyday experience that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">the person we are and does open or close</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">what we can perceive and appreciate and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">see in life</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">and so plato was onto that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">as the kind of foundation for all our</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">knowing and the only big knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">in life that really makes a difference</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">in life</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">i think that he wrote his dialogues um</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">cultivate that sense of knowing though</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">they are dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">um they&#39;re very different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">dialogues you know sometimes it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">like a lecture from socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s almost like a talk from</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">someone else sometimes it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">like genuine encounters</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">and sometimes the framing seems odd it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">to kind of throw you in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">state of unknowing to me you really</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">grapple with what&#39;s being said</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">and but a key thread that runs through</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">are you yourself um being invited to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">as you eat these dialogues i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">plato wanted to try and um replicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">experience of eating socrates in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">flesh and so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">even now we can appreciate something</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">and you mentioned that and you said this</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">to john as well that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">you didn&#39;t quite get plato even when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">were doing an entire phd on it but then</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">barfield</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">opened plato up for you wha what were</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">you missing</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">and what what what that that you now</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">know and that you now apply when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">plato yeah so the heart of it i guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">would be that consciousness evolves</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">and by which our field meant that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">our experience of being alive and our</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:28.839" style="s2">perceptions what seems</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">um self-evident to us and what things</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.839" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">um questionable dramatically shifts</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">over time and whilst</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">um plato and the other ancient greek</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">um i think shared many aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">own conscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">um in particular they thought that um</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">it&#39;s good for the individual ask</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">question which</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">hasn&#39;t always been the case in human</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">history at all um but that was beginning</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.519" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">to become a sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">exactly mainstream but a an acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s i think why philosophy is we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">think of it was born</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">at that time um</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">there&#39;s things which are very different</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">in plato still</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">and barfield got this words he realized</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">that words</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">with meaning very substantially and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">he said the first thing you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.000" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">when you read plato is to unthink what</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">you think you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">by say words like theory because for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">plato theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean an abstract idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">put to the empirical test</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">it primarily means it almost means a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">journey you go on</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">where you encounter a new horizon and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">see whether you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">step over that horizon in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">um and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">all the key words in plato you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">to one side what you think they mean and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">then try and work</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">on your own consciously to um</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">appreciate what he meant back then and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">it really starts to open up particularly</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">if you just treat it as</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">best of rational argument analyze</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t really get anywhere for him um</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">you might even be altered out of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">perception by realizing that plato</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t even have the word analysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">was no such word in plato&#39;s time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">how profound</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">difference is for all that plato can</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">also seem accessible</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">so so we&#39;ve talked about here on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">discord about forming a reading group</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">of going through plato&#39;s uh dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">acting them out you know having</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">different people play the different</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:45.519" style="s2">but you know for the lay person so for</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">for us who</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.519" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">you know those of us who aren&#39;t plato</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">scholars how would you recommend we</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">those books without you know an in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">what each of the words means in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">history of the words or or are we just</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">at a deficit</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">without doing a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">background research</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">um but i think it&#39;s you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">start with</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">um uh one particular dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">um i mean a good one to start with i</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">think is symposium</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">um because uh erotic love</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">and subjects the conversations as um</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">still means more or less the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:29.520" style="s2">to us at one level</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">at relationships and being attracted</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.520" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">to physical bodies other people um but</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">if you let yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">go with what they also seem to imply</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">in the dialogue about eros actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">their passion</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">it connects us with um the most dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">and compelling aspects of reality as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">not just another person and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">get a feel for what dialogue is trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">to really break open for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">through this common experience of erotic</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">love if you start with one like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">you know i think you can um</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">not to make headway and then build from</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">there in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s also really important i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">that kind of translation</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">um preferably one with a good um</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">me up on my direct quote i think um</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">though um that he knew nothing before um</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">the um so a closer sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">because</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:39.039" style="s2">with those encounters do you think that</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.039" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">one of his dialogues is on friendship</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">you start to ask what friendship&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:45.840" style="s2">really about</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">and quite quickly you start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">that perhaps the assumptions you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">with don&#39;t hold in all situations or</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s actually quite hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">to pin down the essence of friendship</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">um and why that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">to you it&#39;s partly a question of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">don&#39;t forget he lives in this period of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">athenian democracy which he saw</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">really going basically wrong um</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">he lived through the peloponnesian war</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">iteration on conflict with martins</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">and it was eventually the undoing of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">athens actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">so he lived for a time of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">athenian crisis</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">and um displaying the democracy</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:37.440" style="s2">or problems he felt are more than just</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">athens in particular it requires a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">certain kind of education</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">um and education that&#39;s really involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not just how to win an</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">argument in the hall courts if it would</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">show you that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">how to have some modesty um about what</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">we do and don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">um so um he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">cultivate that for kind of practical but</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a spiritual side to it or a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">metaphysical like to it as well because</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">um he realized that um this aporia</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">as he put it this kind of moment when</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">you start to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">realize that what you thought you knew</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">actually much harder to pin down or to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">um you&#39;d assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">he felt i think and plato certainly felt</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:28.640" style="s2">is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">of life itself um so</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.640" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">in in contact with that um i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">word that sometimes uses that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">noetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">sense and so it&#39;s beyond a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:42.960" style="s2">um moving towards that which seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">beyond just straightforward propositions</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.960" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">um and you might know much clearly</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:50.159" style="s2">because you&#39;re drawn to it because it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">it shows a certain kind of beauty the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.159" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">words we use now would be the sublime or</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">the wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">um you feel um it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s vitality um but you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">pin it down too much because</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">otherwise you start curtailing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">vitality and curtailing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">expansiveness and so knowing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">i mean maybe um it&#39;s a bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">buddhist i think it&#39;s quite like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">buddhist conception of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">if emptiness doesn&#39;t just mean a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">nihilistic void</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">it actually means the potential from</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">which everything might emerge um</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">or i mean plato wasn&#39;t a theist in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">sense there was no</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">sense of monotheism at the time but</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">platonism certainly became very</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">important in</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">sexualizing monotheism and especially in</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">this sense that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">vine is understandable to us to a degree</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">but we constantly have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to talk about something or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">know something appreciate something live</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">by something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">ultimately is beyond us this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">the source of our life and our vitality</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">in some way</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">um yeah so again this is his kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">agnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">actually opening up on life rather than</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">um either i don&#39;t care or just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">closing it down</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">did you have a follow-up uh goodbye q</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure how to articulate it but</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">i&#39;d like to try and thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">forget that response so</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">there&#39;s something again i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">articulate this as i</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">intend uh there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">between knowing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">and not knowing anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">yeah yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">maybe this is the sense in which it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">meant it um</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t forget i i think the word for</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">i think that came in later english so</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">nothing as we</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think they back then so he</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have meant it in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">um um what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">you know to tell the story you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">famous story that he tells in the</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">as a starter</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">is um friend of his went to the delphic</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">oracle</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">and apollo the god through the delphic</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">oracle told him that no one&#39;s wiser than</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">and he immediately knew that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">to understand an oracle you need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">question um oracles don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">spoon feed you they make you wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">with truth</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">and the gods want to share their</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">insights with you which</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">to change underground capable of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">receiving it</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">but he decides that he&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">around and find someone wiser than</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">athens to prove the oracle wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">he claims that he asks the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">and realizes that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">really know what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">they just believe their own rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">he speaks to the poets and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.799" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">realizes that they&#39;re very good with</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">words but just that doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">about you still get artisans to make a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">pot or a pair of shoes or</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">something on um but they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">mean they know anything else</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">much and then he realizes why he&#39;s wise</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:15.679" style="s2">is because he&#39;s conscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">of the edges of what he doesn&#39;t know um</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.679" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">as he pursues um awareness of things</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">so that is that sense that um he meant</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">thank you very much thank you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">mark you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">yes um mark that&#39;s a great name that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">have there</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">really really appreciate that first name</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">i so there&#39;s sort of three concepts here</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">that stood out to me that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">mentioned so far</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">that i find uh kind of fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">uh instead of like a specific question</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">with a with a definite answer i just</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">was wondering if you could uh maybe riff</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">on this a bit and maybe it doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">together so</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">you know don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">not addressing one of these but</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">you you made an allusion to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">there&#39;s an importance behind aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">that last</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.640" style="s2">right and then you you know so via the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">church etc it seems more</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.640" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">real right than something that say</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">fashion for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">um and then you talked about uh and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">just talked about it again the edges of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">allowing us to step into a bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">wider world</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">uh and and and then i was wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">if those two concepts in any way are</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">connected to each other and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">connected to this</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">uh this thing you talked about as eros</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">as a connection to the dynamic reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">of the world if you could just</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">like riff on those three and maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">they go together or</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">you know i&#39;d like to get your general</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">sense because all three of these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">are are interesting and and sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">in the sphere of uh discussions we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">here on the uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">on this discord uh server yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">thank you and uh um let&#39;s i&#39;ll speak and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">hit me up um</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">well um i mean maybe it just adds</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">another bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">um or impersonally which i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">mentioned actually but was</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">very fundamental um is that um one</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">things which happened when i the church</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">was i went into psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">olly because i needed help um but also</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">because i did begin to get this sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">psychotherapy is closer to ancient</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">and modern philosophy because the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">point of psychotherapy is that you try</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">and understand what&#39;s going on inside</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:48.960" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">and unlike a behavioral therapy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">really ask you to change it asks you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">manage their</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">psychotherapy invites you to change</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">understand things um so</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">psychotherapy i think is a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">good um analog for ancient</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s not the only one but</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a very good one</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">because um you know in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got a problem and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">can&#39;t you&#39;re wrestling with it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">seem to resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">so it takes you to a kind of edge of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">your knowledge which you know because of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">comfort or distress or anxiety or</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">depression whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">um and the psychotherapist says look</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll sit with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">and wrestle with you on this and try and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">all the insights which i can to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">it as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">um and we will stay as much as we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">at the edge of your knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">yourself see what</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">shows up and that in a way i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">to engage the erotic in this broader</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">because one way it requires a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">trust of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">process and maybe even the analyst um</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">it requires a desire which can be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">struggle can be a passion in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">you know the very difficult sense as</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">to own more of yourself um</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.159" style="s2">and um i think it requires imagination</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">um i think imagination is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">word that we would use now um to uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">capture some of this sense that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">insights</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">um or awareness can come from places</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">that we don&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">understand or maybe don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:34.240" style="s2">understand at all you know be that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">dreams</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.240" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">and be that intuitions and be that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">a strange thing happens today be that an</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">encounter that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">difficult or compelling in some way</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">and and imaginatively to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">all these things um comes a pathway to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">understanding more about ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">then understanding more about those</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">around us and the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">as well and these things last</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">because um they have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">so these things you i think truth are</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">the truth of these things</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">not necessarily truth as in doctrinal</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">truths as in um this feels like</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">uh reality is expanding for me and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">picking me somewhere um</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">because they last because they become</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">creative because</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">they do offer more meaning um and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">know that&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">things which were so pressing before</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">ease</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">don&#39;t get resolved completely but they</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">certainly ease</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">and you start to appreciate more of life</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:40.960" style="s2">and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">fuller you feel richer um as the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">romantics put it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">like coleridge</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">field was very very indebted like</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">they made this distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">france&#39;s imagination and they said</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">fantasy is</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">playful and it might be witty but it</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">just comes and goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">and it makes you laugh one day and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">just being unmoved the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something that is genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">imaginative um</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">really lasts and it&#39;s something to build</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">on it feels like a source of life</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">and takes you into new worlds a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">appreciation of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">and so you know a deep aesthetic um</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">can do that if you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">thousand-year-old cathedral here in</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">london</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">um it will make you feel there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">something going on here even though</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">parts of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">as in years ago has lasted and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">lasted for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">i think because it&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">that transcends those thousand years and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">closer something more eternal</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">in reality in the sense of timeless</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">wow that was um that was really</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">interesting uh what you came out with</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">there uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">i yeah this uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">this uh combines quite nicely with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">bunch of stuff i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">uh pondering and we&#39;ve been discussing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">uh on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">discord server in general and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">just to i mean i guess i guess the only</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">sort of missing piece for me because all</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">of this looks really good</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">is uh you know so there&#39;s two sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">around around getting that sense right i</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">mean all these people</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">you know to your point are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">falling away from</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">from the church or from you know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">sense of i guess it&#39;s religio</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">although maybe i&#39;m misusing john&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">i never quite know</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">i&#39;ll ask him today um and and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering you know is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">do you know do you do you know why we</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">might be missing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">imagination to re-engage we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">using our erotic sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">with our deeper uh past aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">i yeah i think it&#39;s because our</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.399" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">consciousness has shifted again</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">and if a bit in between</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">times um i&#39;m a transition</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">i think it began quite a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">probably in the 17th century with</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">what we call the enlightenment what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">call the reformation scientific</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">um our field felt that there were kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">of cycle</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">human consciousness where um periods of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">where women individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">collectively in culture and in on</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">themselves a bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">and in a way only trials</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">and that has the advantage that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">deepens the sense of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">and brings many of the advantages which</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">we experience in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">has the disadvantage that it can leave</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">you feeling cut off and lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">and but um michael carries on and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">eventually things like psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">and that enable us to reconnect i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">some practices you know which john in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">his own journey has been very naturally</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:15.599" style="s2">led</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">towards and realizing that a rational</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.599" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">analysis which</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">from the scientific age tells us should</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">be able to deliver everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.800" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">he&#39;s in life doesn&#39;t in fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">and so in the search and struggle things</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">like practices start to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">pop up or as he&#39;s getting onto as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">and which in a dialogue well actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">the two that matters is</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">the third thing that comes in when</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">people are conversing it&#39;s that sense oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">my goodness</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">that was wonderful um we made that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">connection i didn&#39;t think i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">um or you feel you&#39;re moving towards a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">horizon and something&#39;s opening up</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">and we just haven&#39;t really trusted these</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">ways very much in recent</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">years and centuries kept alive i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">in things like the romantic</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">but unfortunately christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">only i know you know which i guess is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">sort of western christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">um has lost tr lost touch with with what</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">would have been called the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">tradition the visionary</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">referring back to my secret in the title</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">of my book</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">um felt it needs to be scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">um or conversely it&#39;s very elevated</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">at the kind of experience the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">emotional high</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">um you know and they kind of deliver</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">something on a sunday morning but by</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">sunday afternoon it started to run dry a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">you have to go back again and top up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">eventually you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">a bit fed up of topping up and you think</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">well maybe there&#39;s nothing in it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">um christianity in the west i think has</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">very largely lost this sense that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">supposed to change</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">you know that it makes you submit late</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">to the figure of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">as if jesus has done all the work and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fundamental mistake</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">um and so people are falling away from</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">why why wouldn&#39;t they because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">delivering on its promise</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">yeah that uh that makes a lot of sense i</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:21.599" style="s2">mean basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">the summarize uh you know let me know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.599" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve got this right</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s something like uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">too much uh the so the church has</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">focused too much</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">on on procedure and submission</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">and not enough on uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">personal transformation and engagement</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">yeah yeah i mean it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">at least a lot of what church is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">really valuable um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">good so certainly in this country the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">church of england</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s quite it&#39;s very heavily</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">associated with social work and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">um defending people that um</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">don&#39;t get a voice and so on uh correct</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">concerns of justice</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s obviously a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">thing posted and what i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">the risk is that leaving the park text</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">me please takes away from the personal</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">transformation and the point is that to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">be a leader</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">in personal transformation you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">be transforming yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">um and so if your priesthood and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">thinks that its main task is pastoral</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">that may be a very good thing but it may</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">mean that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">they aren&#39;t changing themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">emit that spirit and they won&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">to guide people</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">um whereas you know the contrast to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">is very much with psychotherapy where</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">you have to go for your own therapy you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">what&#39;s the process of change be a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">um and so that personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">and then you know collective as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">um insofar as it ripples out central</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">so it i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">what mistaken about what delivers my</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">knowledge but also</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">it&#39;s lost the practice in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:12.320" style="s2">these practices aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">easy to regain because they are you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.320" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">they&#39;re felt ills really</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s not like um</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">just reading a book and getting it um</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">you have to go on the journey</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.520" style="s2">and you make mistakes and it&#39;s struggle</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">and you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.520" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a failure and because</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">this is not just about extending what</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">you know already</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">about something you emerging um and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:39.599" style="s2">you have to have people around</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">who can say look stick with it um</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.599" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">i know you don&#39;t trust i know this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">really even quite painful</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">um but go for it you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.119" style="s2">and the buddhists know this um you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:52.880" style="s2">certainly the the way the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.119" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">practice is coming into the west it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.880" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">major selling point</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">they have when it&#39;s not just how to kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">of do a bit of mindfulness to help you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">stay at work</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">there&#39;s that side of it but you know a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">serious buddhist practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">knows this and that&#39;s why it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">sit on the cushion and it hurts</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">because they know that something&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">the other side</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">you mentioned that uh you know for</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">example the ancient athenians spent</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">40 to 50 50 of their day on various</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">rituals and participatory religious</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">actions</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">and just mention christians getting away</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">what ecology of practices do you follow</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">yeah i mean it&#39;s a good question and um</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">a very largely</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">the moment anyway around two areas one</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">is the psychotherapy practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s um about</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">thirds of my week um so that means being</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">with people and then it means also doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">the personal work</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">and whether that be provision as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">called with other therapists</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">i&#39;m being thinking about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">my own personal practice which you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">paul d is around meditation</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">um but also am i i i&#39;m quite</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">actually at the moment a big online</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">project for me is um</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">dante&#39;s divine comedy so the divine</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">comedy is 700</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">years old this year and um the huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:31.359" style="s2">amount written about the divine comedy</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">eventually missing is the divine comedy</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">as a spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">as a spiritually transformative text i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">and of course that means i have to be</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">be what&#39;s going on with minds insofar as</p>

<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">and so in christian circles that would</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">be called lectio divina</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">i&#39;m a kind of contemplative body of text</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">into in a felt sense of what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">communicated</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">um i&#39;m also a huge fan of william blake</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">i live in south london and blake</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">and the road angels on peckham rye which</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">for me and i&#39;m very fascinated by that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">think we feel that blake</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">um he had visions he had strange</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">life um but he didn&#39;t just sort of as it</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.880" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">enjoy the trip but enormously hard</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.880" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">make sense of that both in english and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">words in poetry and because i think he</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">you realize that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">take that into yourself be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">something of it be able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">participate in otherwise is due an odd</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">experience or a strange vision</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">um and so blake has become extremely</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">to me actually as i wrestle with him you</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">know he&#39;s really is quite hard to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">understand beyond hating the better</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.440" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">known poems</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">um but i think he deliberately makes you</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">on my website</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">uh yeah um i&#39;m also a big fan of blake</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:57.040" style="s2">so i was happy to hear that uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">crediting of his work um my</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">question uh revolves around tillich</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">and if you are familiar with him and uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">if so</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">how you might view his work in light of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">barfield&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">and also how we might see tilik</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">as kind of uh wrestling with classical</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">theism</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:25.319" style="s2">um and if that perhaps could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">considered a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.319" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">revitalization of classical theism</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">um and perhaps how it might relate to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">platonic and neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">thought and what they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">aiming at as opposed to the kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:41.599" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.599" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">overly gnostic flavor that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">credited</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">uh to them</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">yeah i mean the first thing i should say</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">is i don&#39;t actually know a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">about tilik beyond</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">headline occasionally it&#39;s like ground</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">of being myself and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">appreciation that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">existentialism um so if i say</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">a couple of things then you can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">whether they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">helpful or not because they may just not</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">be um i think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">um barfield was suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">um and i think the reason was was</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">um he felt that its premise was that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">um we have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">our gift as well our freedom is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">something of life and you know our</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">existence comes before our essence</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">and um he felt that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">that probably only generates those</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">symptoms of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">um where um you know maybe a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">apology or philosophy um maybe one that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">is full of passion you know full of fear</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">and trembling and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">born and ethically very demanding</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">um can be forged and but</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">i think he feared that it just leaves</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">you ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">turning circles on yourself um</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">and um it was very clear that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">the goal of consciousness is not just to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">know the inside of your own psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">maybe the inside of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">a culture&#39;s psyche as he put it the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">inside of the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:27.370" style="s2">and so i think he was suspected that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:30.460" style="s2">actually travel of existentialism</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s he wouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">barfield and sometimes this is said to</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">was wrong to call blake and mystic he</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">um he he brought things and he could put</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t just that kind of</p>

<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">ultimately is a sort of dance around the</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">and yeah maybe i&#39;ll just stop there and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">ask whether that actually charms with</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.520" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">i did not distinctly get the sense from</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">sense that he was</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">um but yeah that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:47.880" style="s2">nonetheless nonetheless interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">would you say in some sense then that</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">take and perhaps i&#39;m i&#39;m reading this</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">more of c.s lewis&#39;s apologetics but that</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">to hear that about tillick and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">happy that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">thanks and that might well be right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">he wants to do or</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">sort of starting from where he was at as</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">on um on barfield</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">and lewis had this lifelong argument</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">broadly speaking i think you can say</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">that our field never persuaded lewis</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">fully but the imagination itself could</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">be truth-bearing</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s always felt you&#39;ve really got to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">come up with a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">um to know that it&#39;s really true um</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">and so you know and again i i appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">on your stories um you know can feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">very different to different people but</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">for me i&#39;m one of those people that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">reads bananas because it always feels</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">they&#39;re a bit allegorical</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">they&#39;re a bit illustrated other than say</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">tolkien</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">but you feel you absolutely enter um</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">a complete world to complete cosmos um</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s because i think talking like</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">barfield completed the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">um and so that was his primary</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">off and you then have to work hugely</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">hard to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">words even the language in tolkien&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">case so it&#39;s not without reason at</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">all the reason is in the service of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">imagination i think louis</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">always felt that imagination is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">other way around um and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">they&#39;re very different way i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">that it might even more explicit the bar</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">when he um persuaded about the power of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">and just what through his philology he</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">apologized so he he studied words and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">how words change meaning so he had kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">of an empirical base for</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">and but when he worked out sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">then discovered rudolf steiner um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">and um chris never begin to understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">why barfi was</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">interested in kind of um you know i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">put my hand up and say i&#39;m not complete</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">or either i get some sense of it now</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">but um if you the colorful disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:38.319" style="s2">over steiner but there was a sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">degree disagreement about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.319" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">relationship between and the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">and so i think lewis&#39;s success in</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">circles is precisely because he</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">seems to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">sense of christianity um</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">in the world in a christian culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">which needs rational defense it</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:05.359" style="s2">is as good as it gets um but</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">not good enough i don&#39;t at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">the day it leaves you with this vague</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">the argument but really</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">they life is full in my view</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">right i i would agree with you there and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">i uh appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">that differentiation between uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">barfield</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">and and louis there i i would uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">definitely fall on the side of</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">barfield um one thing that came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">as you were describing</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">that that difference seems to be almost</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">this this</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">uh totally different idea of what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">actually represents with with um</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">lewis kind of falling on logos as logic</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">and bar field falling uh towards this</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">this uh much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">kind of alive or dynamic sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">in the creative pursuit itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">uh and how that relates to the imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">yeah so um again one way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">you know as a starter at least a bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">more complicated than this</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">subtle and sophisticated to lewis credit</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">you know he&#39;s immensely i think i</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">deny that for a moment and but as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">starter for 10</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">um i think lewis had a broadly</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">scientific understanding of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:32.400" style="s2">um that it&#39;s objective tool</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">um that is like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.400" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">atoms um and structures as it were</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">throughout the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">um ways of being in a kind of ordered</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s rational in that sense as i</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">think for barfield</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">um the heart of hogos is actually soul</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s vitality birds have meaning because</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">they convey</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.400" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">energy spirits and you don&#39;t just as</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">points at things they actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">channel what they&#39;re pointing at to you</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">um you know which is explicitly so in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">poetry but even in prose and so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">is um the vitalizing principle</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">in the cosmos um it&#39;s the it&#39;s the far</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">in the equations not just the equations</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">to einstein&#39;s phrase</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">um and that again that that i think they</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">they could argue the toss a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">difference distinguishes them</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">right thank you for that um i guess a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">final follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">might be pulling it back to one of my uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">initial questions here</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:43.040" style="s2">would be uh how much do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:44.319" style="s2">um you know what what barfield was</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">aiming for there</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.319" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">was present in uh platonic</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">and neoplatonic thought and was</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:57.799" style="s2">do you see it as in some way part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">that tradition or a re uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.799" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">reconfiguration of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.000" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question um we look</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just a thought which i hope</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">somewhere um</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">oh you know the logos begins in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">western anyway in the rest of written to</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:23.359" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">with heraclitus at the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">for heraclitus it was the principle that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">altogether</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:30.240" style="s2">the sense that everything is dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">everything&#39;s in a bit of flux</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">into the same river twice and all that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">a sense of unity that although you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">step into the same river twice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">still the same river</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">and there is something that amidst the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">flux holds things all together</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.000" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">and that oneness he called the logos</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">and so he says you know don&#39;t listen to</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">me listen to the logos he was constantly</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">pointing towards that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">vision and rather than just neat</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">comments about rivers flowing</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:00.839" style="s2">um so that gets picked up i think in</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">plato</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.839" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">um you know um</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">they had great</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">faith in words you know plato prunedly</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">so he was an amazing writer</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">um which i next</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">keep on giving um and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">that flux ability is actually in his</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">um you can read them again and they can</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">any different over the course of your</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">own life</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">and yet somehow they&#39;re all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">still revolving around</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:41.440" style="s2">one thing that dialogues might</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">channel and so that&#39;s the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.440" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">logos i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:49.920" style="s2">later um neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">they try to knit that in with stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.920" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">and and also um</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">the perspective brought by aristotle i i</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">think that plato and aristotle are so</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">complimentary rather than</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">be different and again a huge subject</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">for discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">um and so in particular what happens i</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">think is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">in stoicism you get this much more</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">bigger stress on on self-reflection</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">um and is even really in plato um</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a sort of deepening of the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">the individual that comes in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">hellenistic age</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">and so that focuses on our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">with logos um</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">you know recently it&#39;s called um</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">spiritual exercises</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:38.799" style="s2">are very much bringing on that it brings</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">in a more personal element and then i</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.799" end="00:57:41.920" style="s2">think christianity</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">actually says the logos has become</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.920" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">incarnate in a person that&#39;s how strong</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">the link</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:49.359" style="s2">is between this divine box that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.359" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">um that actually it can be completely</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">and fully transmitted in we human beings</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:01.359" style="s2">the task comes not just as it were</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:03.839" style="s2">writing beautifully about</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.359" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">the logos it has dialogues but becomes</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.839" end="00:58:07.200" style="s2">actually eliminating the logos in your</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">own life</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.200" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">all invited there in that relational</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">possibility now</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">um so becomes you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">by up close personal insight outside</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:24.480" style="s2">across that tradition from heraclitus</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly the greek dutch fathers</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.480" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">who in that way</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">they&#39;re so powerfully influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">platonism platinus</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">right that was wonderful thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.839" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">so in the introduction to your book uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">to into the secret life of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:48.400" style="s2">you you talk about knowing uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">that your life springs from god&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.400" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">and this truth is yours to be discovered</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:53.280" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">putting aside the specifics of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.280" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">claim you talk about that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">known directly</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">not on the basis of someone else else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">report or someone else&#39;s authority</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">or someone else&#39;s rhetoric but inwardly</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">and reliably</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">now so on that word reliably uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:10.640" style="s2">i i i&#39;m a big proponent of you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:12.480" style="s2">withholding belief in</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.640" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">claims you know absent sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.480" end="00:59:17.040" style="s2">reliable evidence</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">based on that internal felt experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.040" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">how do you how do you get to reliable</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">yep um you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.799" end="00:59:31.359" style="s2">uh quite correctly you know draw me up</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">on my initial</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.359" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">offer in the book and</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:45.839" style="s2">the reliability um comes with the change</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.839" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">with and the development of your sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">of self</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">um and it&#39;s it reason why i say direct</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">is because at the end of the day it does</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">rest in the sense of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">um and um you kind of know it when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">see it it&#39;s a bit like</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">the comment that sometimes made about</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">music if you&#39;ve got to ask you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">um in music to me no you some expression</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">will help but ultimately you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.680" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">listen and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">get into it and then directly why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">so powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">it&#39;s that kind of a journey um</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">i mean one way that this was schematized</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">i hope this is illuminating it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">just feel like dodging the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:28.720" style="s2">um but one way that this was</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:29.760" style="s2">traditionally schematized certainly in</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:33.119" style="s2">the christian tradition was</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.760" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">how various kind of levels of knowing um</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">and basic level is literal</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">um and it&#39;s not very reliable</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">is it easily fixed with other claims to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">knowledge you know literal truths tend</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:48.000" style="s2">to conflict</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">they have very limited scope and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.000" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">next level was</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.200" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">allegorical and that you say something</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:57.440" style="s2">to point to something more than just the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:01:00.720" style="s2">literal in a kind of parallel way</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">um so if i said um</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.720" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">i&#39;m a tiger literate um because i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">ginger hair</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">say um you would know literally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:12.640" style="s2">if i said no but i&#39;m like a type i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">oh well maybe he&#39;s saying he&#39;s got a bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.640" end="01:01:15.440" style="s2">of a fierce temp</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:16.799" style="s2">temper or something like that so you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.440" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">sort of make some sense of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.799" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">um if i said no no i&#39;m a tiger</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ll say for us of course that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">would get you to a third level</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">um which would be the tropological level</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">in the tradition</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">uh the shock of me saying no i&#39;m a tiger</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">if you think oh my goodness i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:36.960" style="s2">really understood what on earth he was</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">saying at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.960" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">and he&#39;s not just saying he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:43.839" style="s2">fierce temper he&#39;s saying something else</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">and then i say maybe in a bit more of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">zen-like way i&#39;m at you think oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s saying life one</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">and one with the tiger because life is</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:58.480" style="s2">one in some way there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:02:01.920" style="s2">deep perception of being in that um</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.480" end="01:02:05.839" style="s2">now that um when you glimpse that</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.920" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">that is eyeball knowledge and a reliable</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.839" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">kind of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.280" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">um but it takes this journey</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">to it um i think you know when when i</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.079" style="s2">say it&#39;s reliable also perhaps i should</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">qualify it by saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.079" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">that um i don&#39;t think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">that you know all day every day</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">invariably you&#39;ll have our ups and downs</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">when you return to it you realize it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">perception that before and so over time</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">you begin to trust that it&#39;s there even</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">when you don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">and so it&#39;s reliable in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">so so the reliability isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">on the propositional claim but on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:49.119" style="s2">the the participatory claim the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:50.720" style="s2">perspectival claim and i thank you i</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.119" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">mean they&#39;re great words that john uses</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.720" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">i think that&#39;s precisely that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:55.599" style="s2">there&#39;s you know i think that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.599" end="01:02:59.839" style="s2">that difference yeah the propositions</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:01.839" style="s2">are good starters for 10.</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.839" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">like doctrines are good starters for ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.839" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">like scientific theories kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">placeholders for a while um but you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.880" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">be um inadequate at some point that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">part of their purpose as well</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">and so you know propositional knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:20.400" style="s2">is it can do for a time it&#39;s a bit like</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">saying i&#39;m a christian that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.400" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">nervous is saying i&#39;m a christian</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:26.160" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t want that to be thought as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:27.680" style="s2">kind of literal proposition because</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">already it means a thousand different</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:32.720" style="s2">things to a thousand different people</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:35.039" style="s2">um but you know if i said something like</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.720" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">christian way of seeing things has got</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.039" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">deep resources that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">actually i think is one of the best off</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.280" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">ways to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.480" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">truest things that we can know um</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.760" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">that is uh is</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">going to annoy people that want</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.559" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">propositional statements that actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:58.720" style="s2">feels much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">rude to me</p>
