<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">these subjects it&#39;s been really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.719" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.280" style="s2">i find myself thinking in the categories</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">that you are</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">kind of a secular audience or also</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">convincing</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:14.799" style="s2">christians that the the words they use</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">have meaning you know because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.799" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">we have this kind of internal language</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">and and it stops to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">meaningful in the world and it just</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">becomes like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">kind of magical language so i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:26.560" style="s2">using your expressions uh</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">different frame so that they understand</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.759" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">that for me that&#39;s that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">in which i try to enact the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">ideal of being the midwife</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">specifically talking about you released</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">links to them</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">in the description of this video uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">one was on</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">i i i won&#39;t get the actual verbatim name</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">one what was it was on sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">religious nature of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">demonstrations that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">around that were sort of galvanized into</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">existence by uh the death of george</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">floyd</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">and then you and then you did a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">follow-up there was sort of like part</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">one and part two</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">yeah on one on the the iconoclasm the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">destruction of images the pulling down</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">of statues</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">and one of the things you did um</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">was you put your finger on a huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">important aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">that is being completely ignored um in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">but i think is of vital importance um</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">as has happened in the past between uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">you and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">i are very convergent i was coming to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">very similar concerns</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">um and reflections um and i&#39;d said some</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">things early on about how covid was</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">going to accelerate the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">and cause just a mental health tsunami</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">and you&#39;d see</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">you know a proliferation of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">theory thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">um you know you&#39;d see purity code</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">um people human beings are going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">respond and you know fashion to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">invisible</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">ubiquitous threat that&#39;s uh causing them</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">to isolate and as you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">i like your uh your invocation of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">symbolic idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">of fasting for most of their connections</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">and so and then i saw all of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">um and then when the protests began</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">um i had i so i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">i had a a reaction that made me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">recuse myself from commit uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">commenting on that publicly part of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">was a concern</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">that which you said in your first video</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">of just you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">saying something that would be premature</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">polarizing uh it was difficult to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">anything that was going to be heard with</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">it had any kind of nuance or reflection</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">so part of it was just that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">caution</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">but there was a deeper issue for me i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">was very concerned and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">i talked to my close friend about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">that i i would fall into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">kind of self-deceptive bias when i tried</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">to talk about any of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">so give me a moment please i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">mean to trespass from your patients but</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">i want to in order to try and articulate</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">this and this has helped me upon</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">reflection i want to invoke</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">weber&#39;s distinction between the manifest</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">and the latent function</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">so to give you a classic example um</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">you know weber talked about uh the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">manufacture</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">the manifest function of the bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">is to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">you know information traveling upward</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">and decisions start going downward</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s its manifest function but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">has all kinds of latent functions it has</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">the latent function</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">of allowing people to diffuse</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">responsibility and shift blame onto</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">and kafka of course brought this into</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">high art he showed us how the latent</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">can you know put us into a tragic</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">situation because</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">i am being told that i have an original</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">sin that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">not because of any act that i committed</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">but that is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">because of how i was born and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an aspect of this that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">unforgivable</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">no matter what i do and everything i try</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">to do to overcome this</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">just makes it that much worse and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">that i need i need to be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">contrite</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">and guilty until some</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">obscure authority will finally pronounce</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">uh you know you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">saved or whatever and that and and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">what this</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">what this brings with it you know is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">bonfires and i mean i&#39;m not i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">being hyperbolic jonathan i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">gathering behind the church and putting</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">the rock and roll albums and the books</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">into a thing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">lighting it on fire like can you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve been through that too i i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">with that kind of stuff as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">okay so and and uh and and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">realizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">that the latent functionality of this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.840" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">so reminiscent of kind of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">puritanical</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">fundamentalist protestantism um</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">and and again i was noticing the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">things you&#39;re noticing you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">the the acts of contrition the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">throwing down of the stones and the high</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">like from the old testament right where</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">the prophets are always doing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">right the the kneeling and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">confessions</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">uh and and the statement that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">i can do about it other than feel guilty</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">i i was noticing how this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">uh was tremendously religious and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">that that as i said to others that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">upbringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">like that upbringing traumatized me i</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">mean i remember i remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">going to the minister in the church with</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">my mother when i because i i read the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">bible</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">regularly daily uh and and i came across</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">the passage in the new testament</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">about the unforgivable sin oh yes oh and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">this just</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">i fell into i mean cartesian skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">was nothing compared to the well</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">i fell into about well how do i know</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">and how do and how like did i just do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">and if it&#39;s unforgivable i&#39;m now doomed</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">i&#39;m doomed</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">right and and and that feeling of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.920" style="s2">doomed and trapped</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">and and you know and i went to him and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.920" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">wanted what i wanted was a clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">uh definition of what it was and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">and and i got i just got you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">the usual you need to have faith and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">it was very unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">and so i i and so i was realizing oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">john you better keep your mouth closed</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">because even if you want to speak about</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">this this is just going to come</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">flowing through you uh because and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">going to and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a because you have an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">bias it&#39;s very hard for you to see this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">in a positive light even though sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">intellectually you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">these important things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">already mentioned you know the rate the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">the racist history uh you know the this</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">the subversive disenfranchisement of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">right uh uh the militarization of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">police all of these things are real</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">and they need to be addressed but uh but</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">i realized if i try to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">my chances of speaking uh in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">i think is clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">we&#39;re like going to be seriously</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:42.320" style="s2">undermined so i just sort of held back</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">but then i saw your videos and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.320" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">well maybe i maybe with jonathan&#39;s help</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">i can talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">sorry i don&#39;t intend this to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">therapy session that&#39;s not what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">on here</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">i want to be really i want to be really</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">open with you about where i&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">your video actually points out that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">well let me i might be too bold it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">suggested to me that this tension that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">i&#39;m finding in myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">is not exclusive to me that i i sensed</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">in you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">not to the degree i&#39;m talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">also a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">you know what this might be sort of at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">manifest level</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">and then this unacknowledged latent</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">function of religiousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">and then you have some criticisms at</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">least implicit of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">you had towards the end you you warned</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">of danger in the in the first video</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">uh because the the the the religion that</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">does not know that it&#39;s a religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">is not oriented towards the ultimate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">sort of there&#39;s like a like a critique</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">coming like</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">via like or similar to what tilikud</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">meant you&#39;re it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">ultimately it&#39;s an idolatrous for all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">its bringing down of images</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s ultimately an idolatrous religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">and then i was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">when i was thinking about how uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">you know that politics is is has in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">ways taken over</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">uh the domain of religion i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">well uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">it&#39;s drenched the 20th century in blood</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">uh but</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">i noted that well there&#39;s sort of two</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">religions are supposed to have like you</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">said they&#39;re supposed to be moments of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">communitas</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">and transformation and i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">think well what are what are the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">rituals left to politics well so there</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">seemed to be two</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">and it was noted how they seem to split</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">between the right and the left</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">there&#39;s the demonstration of the protest</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">or the rally</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">um and and the right likes the rally and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">the left likes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">the the demonstration the protest and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:34.639" style="s2">then i&#39;m thinking and both of these we</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">have good historical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">don&#39;t bring about the new man the new</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">person the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">of human beings um you know and all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">the revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">uh left then right the french revolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">except onward</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">uh show that it doesn&#39;t bring about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">although there is often</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">a religious goal within the french</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">revolution and you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">worshiping the goddess of reason and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">that stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t actually bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">promised uh transformation</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">uh that it is uh uh groping towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">um and so i i was thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">is it possible to talk about this sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">um in terms uh that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">meta-political</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">about the latent functionality of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">religion and at that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">level legitimately criticize it without</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">thereby</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">implying that we think or i&#39;m not i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">speak on my behalf not yours</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">without thereby implying that i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t do something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">the militarization of the police um the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">subversive suppression of voting and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">disenfranchisement of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">and then how that has often allied</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">itself uh with historical factors that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">are ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">uh of racism etc that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">proposing to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">is it possible and i&#39;d like to try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">explore that with you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.519" style="s2">but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the frame</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">i want to set up yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">for sure there&#39;s a i think there are a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">lot of things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">deal with in what you said a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">things to kind of unpack at different</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">levels i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">maybe we can kind of separate them in</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">different parts so that we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:11.160" style="s2">completely jumbled one is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">to look at the possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.160" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">reinterpretation of of your experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">i&#39;d say or the notion</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">of the original sin then the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">adam or the fall of adam what that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">what that can mean and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">reinterpret that in a manner which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">more useful than your traumatized youth</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">understand because i went through all</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">the stuff you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">you dealt with i went through the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">and even the description of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">the the idea of blaspheming the holy</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">spirit and everybody wondering like did</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">i blaspheme the holy spirit you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">all of that i understand but i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">there are ways to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">to reappropriate the stories</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">those stories and i say reappropriate is</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">i also believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">one of the reasons why i went towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">orthodoxy is because they have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">vision of of the fall of adam um one</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">which i think it has a healthier balance</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s one and then the other is then</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">looking also at the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">these protests or covid</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">and the protests together kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">just exploded into a kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">and what that means and what it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">of looking towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">um and so sadly the third part which</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">would be like how to get out of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:29.839" style="s2">kind of this bind that we&#39;re in is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">one which i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">like i really i a lot of people ask me</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">so what should we do and i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">and i think i don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">except i don&#39;t know what to do socially</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">like i think i know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think i know what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">societal solution is so</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">so maybe that one will be harder well</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">but i do want to talk about that because</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve been talking about that with other</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">people as well so</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m happy with your proposal um</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">but like i said i&#39;d like to put it uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">like i said into</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">the way in which um what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">it has uh you know at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">latent functions</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">uh there&#39;s well you said it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">use your words there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">dangerous happening in this as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">and i want to explicate and draw that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">out um i&#39;m happy to hear</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">uh your revisions and so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">what to call it let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">revisioning rather than revision yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">these of these stories</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">um and then but if you could put that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">because okay let me let me instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">making a statement let me</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">make ask a question it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">request</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">i see in you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">i see an analog to a strong analog</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">in this movement to that version of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">original sin that i was brought up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:52.240" style="s2">and let&#39;s remember that the word</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">protestant means those who protest</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.240" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">i mean right there and i i was brought</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">up in a church where</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">you know protesting and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">declaring what was evil</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">and what should be burnt or you know and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">and that that was like that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">daily um the kind of practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">so do you think that i&#39;m incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">in saying that the version of original</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">sin whether or not it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.160" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">i i&#39;m going to give you space to talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">about that but do you think that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">that you know maybe overly augustinian</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">version of original sin is what&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">in in this movement right now am i</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">incorrect about no i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">definitely right i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">definitely right</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">one of the and i think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">that we&#39;ve seen before</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">in the sense that maybe an inverted</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">version of what we&#39;ve seen before</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">in terms of like racialized vision of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">the world in the past</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">which is that we&#39;ve taken the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">original sin and we&#39;ve brought it down</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">biology which is the scariest thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:57.919" style="s2">can happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">because it it actually is inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.919" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">like it actually does become inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">it&#39;s linked in a it not in a really</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">scientific way at all but</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">in a mythological way it&#39;s it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">brought into a term which is using</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">language of of kind of biological</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">identity or</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">categories which are material categories</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">the idea of this racialized guilt</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">or you know was there in kind of 17th</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:29.760" style="s2">racism like kind of neo darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">kind of social darwinist racism this</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.760" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">that certain races were inferior by</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">their own biology and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">were made to be slaves or were made to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">be the lower and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a kind of weird reversal of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">that where we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:48.559" style="s2">to be a certain race is in itself to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">the oppressor like to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.559" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">to be white is to be guilty of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">the the sin of the revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">completely original sin it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">the end of the revolutionary trend in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">in thinking right the french revolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">the marxist revolutions and now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">come to kind of the end of it where</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">we&#39;re actually bringing</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">it into almost a biological reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">where the guilt of the oppressor is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">a racial guilt and it&#39;s and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">so that so like you said it does</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">relate to original sin because it means</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">that as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">has that identity whether it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">legitimate scientifically or not it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">they&#39;re still framed in those categories</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">as someone who has that identity i</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">have no way out like i have no way out</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">except for two things which your people</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">are doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">which is to self-flagellate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">to scapegoat that is to put myself on</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">to put myself on the side of find</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">someone guiltier than me</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">yes and yell at him and tell him that he</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">has to be canceled and he has to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">excluded from society yes the only the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">only two solutions</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">yeah and that i like i said i i went</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.440" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">periods where the the church i was in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">would be riven to bits</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">by exactly that that process repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">in cycles again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">when i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">when i sort of woke up to that i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">like whoa this is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">like when i started reading some</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">literature and i realized and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">the literature like showed me what human</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">beings could be other than this</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">that was like so but you&#39;re right in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">protestant sense like if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">protestant sex and you notice both the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">puritanist</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">kind of self-flagellation of of uh of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">complete depravity</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">and then the shismatic notion that all</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">the group i&#39;m in is not pure enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">they&#39;re not close enough to the truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">and and then removing myself with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">little a smaller group</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">and then condemning those on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">as being</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">as it&#39;s like an acceleration it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">been there it&#39;s there in every</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">every structure like we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">that but there&#39;s an acceleration of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">fragmentation of of uh protestantism and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">we see it in intersectionality to an</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">extent which becomes completely absurd</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">you know at some point it&#39;s so obscure</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">that most like regular people don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">know what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">when trans-exclusive this and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">trans-inclusive and we don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">most people are like i don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">and then it&#39;s there&#39;s smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">smaller identities which are</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">are excommunicating other identities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">yeah so i mean that to my mind that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">uh the meaning crisis on on steroids or</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">methamphetamine or something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">so so what and i think given</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">the deeply deleterious effects which</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing uh you and i were talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">just before we hit the record</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">about you know we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">know uh i you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re people that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">normally sort of very sane</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">like you know our personal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">are moving more towards the fringe and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">filled with anxiety and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">describing their experiences surreal</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">i think you know the deleterious effects</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">of the meeting crisis are being</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">exacerbated</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">by covid and then perhaps by uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">certain latent aspects of this but i</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">wanted to give you the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">uh to make good on your promise uh that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">there&#39;s an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">way there&#39;s an alternative way and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in this both</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">and personally i typically don&#39;t try not</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">to get too personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">in these conversations but this one has</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">to be different for the reasons i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">already articulated</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m putting my trust in you about</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">this um so</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s an alternative way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">conceiving of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">the the myth of original sin and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">know i use that word</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">in not in a pejorative fashion uh but</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">and so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">what is that alternative understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">so the way to understand it is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">clearly differentiate between sin</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">and death um they&#39;re related but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">um and so in scripture it says the wages</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.120" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">of sin</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">is death right and there&#39;s an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">even in the in scripture it never says</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">that we inherit the sin of adam it says</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">that we because of adam&#39;s sin we are we</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">are in death like we are in the in</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">in we are living in a world of death</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s really the best way to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">understand it which is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:29.919" style="s2">sin causes death so you you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">purpose you miss the mark</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.919" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s what death is and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:34.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a brokenness it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.799" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">the system breaks down as you miss the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">mark and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">happens at every level of reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">whether it&#39;s in your own life or</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">in society or in the entirety of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">when when something misses the mark then</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">there is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">breakdown which happens now we we</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">inherit the breakdown of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">before us right we inherit death</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">so we are born in families that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">missed the mark we are born</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">of parents that have missed the mark we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">are born of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">systems that have missed the mark and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">because of that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">we live in a world which has an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">of it which is broken</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">we still have the aspiration of hitting</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">the mark and that&#39;s that&#39;s what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">guides us and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">makes us want to live but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">live with the consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">of that of that miss um</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">and the difficulty is that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">in a world of death</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">that is when you inherit the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">sin so when your parents miss the mark</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">and they will and we know they do</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">yeah you inherit that and it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">more difficult for you to hit the mark</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">because you have all the baggage which</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">comes and you have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">the the the patterns of being that will</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">make that worse right which will which</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">will increase the brokenness which will</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">tend to fragment</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">okay and so that&#39;s the manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">we need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.720" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">original sin that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">inheritance of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">brokenness so so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">and i hope i hope you take this as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">helpful thing that to me reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">you know certain interpretations of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">buddhist notion of karma</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">that there are these patterns at work</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">and and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.159" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">and we inherit them um and they affect</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">our behavior and they they cause</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">suffering uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">and the way i sort of understood this at</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">least psychologically and existentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">as you said you know we we pick up from</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">others our parents our friends and our</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">culture we pick up</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">and you know here&#39;s where historical</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">racism does matter right we pick up</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">um that are shaping us and moving us um</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.840" style="s2">in ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">that are detrimental to our aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">is that a fair yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">yeah but the idea is the idea is of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">the very desire the very aspiration that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">is the very possibility we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">of conceiving the good and of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">the point that we&#39;re aiming at right of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">of seeing it in our view and and moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">towards it</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">right is is the very</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">how can i say this is the reminder that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">we are not that we don&#39;t fit in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">broken world that we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">that we are we find dissatisfaction in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">the brokenness</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s what causes our suffering but</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">what can ultimately cause our hope</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">because we see</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">we can see that we&#39;re not made like</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">there&#39;s something in us which</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">wants more than this brokenness and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">this world of death there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">us which is which can see that which we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">can aim towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">and which is the good of course um and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">so that is really the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">and so what let&#39;s say what christianity</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">shows us and like what christ shows us</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">is that the manner to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">reach the the manner to reach</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">the the aim in the brokenness</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">is to a certain extent embrace death</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s really the that&#39;s the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">thing is to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">death consciously embrace the brokenness</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">consciously</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">and therefore we don&#39;t become slaves of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">that brokenness</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s to see your sins to see the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">place where you miss the mark</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">instead of just blaming your parents</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">because that&#39;s what you will want to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">right you want to blame your parents</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">you want to blame the system and your</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">the system is broken your parents are</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">broken everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">there&#39;s an aspect of everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">given to you which is broken not</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">fully but there is an aspect of it which</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">is broken and the solution is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">is to actually rather see your own death</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">the places in you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re dead and recapture</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:03.679" style="s2">the the vision right recapture the aim</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">um so this this brings me to a central</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.679" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">question that i have about this thank</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">you for that i think that was very</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">so let&#39;s shift the discussion onto</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">um mortality then um and the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">thing of course and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of this i know in the greek</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">world is mortality has a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">and heidegger developed this a lot it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">has a much more encompassing notion to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">and then that&#39;ll help lead me to my</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">question to you uh you know because one</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">of the great sins</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">and i think this is the right word uh in</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">the greek world is hubris right uh which</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">to in some sense forget your mortality</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">right right and to think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">that right that you can be a god and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:43.760" style="s2">know this is captured in great</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">literature you know conrad&#39;s heart of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.760" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">darkness</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">which of course is now contentious work</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">but nevertheless kurtz&#39;s big sin</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">is hubris right he forgets and marlo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">marlo&#39;s heroism</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">is he commits himself to his humanity</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">that he will preserve</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">his mortality and i&#39;ve been talking uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">to my son about this because</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">uh you know he lives with me now</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">partially because of covet and uh and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve been exposing him to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">certain ideas and he&#39;s going but you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">know but i want certainty and i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">well um yeah but you can&#39;t part of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">being you know be embracing your</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">mortality is to realize</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:23.120" style="s2">that no matter how good your idea might</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.279" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">be uh you&#39;re ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.120" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">a fallible human being you&#39;re finite and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">he was going but i don&#39;t like this and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">but your mortality isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">right and and you&#39;ll see how this</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">connects to what you&#39;re saying in a sec</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">the mentality isn&#39;t the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">you know like in tolstoy&#39;s ivan elitch</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">ivan elix knew he was going to die</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that your</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">mortality is that like you said in</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">in some fundamental way uh you know we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">are finite we are broken we are not</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">gods so and i&#39;m seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">in my discussion with him how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">do you because i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">work this with him as a father getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">embrace their mortality is good</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">uh because it prevents inflation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">prevents hubris it prevents i i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">it would prevent blasphemy</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">too from a christian perspective um</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">uh and as you said it helps people uh to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">uh not to fall into the error of by</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">criticizing others i implicitly remove</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">myself from that criticism right</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">i i see all of that how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">uh without the trump without</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">traumatizing them</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">sorry sorry that was a bit of a garden</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">path i broke no no i</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">i think there i think there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna say that but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">trauma is part of the experience like i</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">no i understand but death is death is is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">traumatic like</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">there is a trauma in death um</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">and so we need like the the church</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">fathers and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">the ascetics they always say two things</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:08.720" style="s2">they say remember god and remember death</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">right those are the two things you need</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.720" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">to remember i always kind of joke around</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the the christian</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">version of uh of like uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">mindfulness you know it&#39;s like remember</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">god remember death right and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">the idea that if you if you are if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">kind of remain in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">death like you said you avoid all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">problems that you talked about and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">strange paradox in christianity is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">by doing that you actually do become god</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">yes like you you actually do become</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">deified ultimately if you do those two</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">things right</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">but but it&#39;s a non-inflationary exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of the paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">the the paradox of of of creation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">the paradox of uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">of the garden of eden which is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">if adam had submitted to the will of god</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">and not eaten of the fruit of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">then god would have given him the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the tradition right</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">that&#39;s what many saints have said</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">and not only that but that that would</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">have been his access to the tree of life</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">which would have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">perfect communion with the divine and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">it is in humility that we actually reach</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">the highest</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting i just read this</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">morning when i was doing my lecture</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">davina uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">rilka&#39;s passage where he talks about uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">we throw a ball into the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">and then it returns to us differently it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">returns to us heavier</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">and in it&#39;s only in that in in having</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">done that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">that we actually get to feel the true</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">weight of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">um and it sounds like uh you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">something very analogous to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">so how do we avoid the trauma i i all i</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">can say is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">the idea is obviously to place the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">ultimately to place it in christ like</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">the ultimate trauma</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">right is is communion like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">ultimate trauma</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">if you really take communion seriously</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">you are engaging in a traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">experience you are eating</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">the flesh and blood of the god man</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">like you are you are at the foot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">horror like we</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">you know you talk about horror a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">your in your in your um</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">in your lectures and i one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">i do want to bring up to you is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">is why communion one of the aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">communion is to bring you into that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">horror</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">in a manner which will which will save</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">you and not destroy you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">right in a manner in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">integrate it in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">both a participation in horror</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">and a communion of love at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">in a paradoxical way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">yeah i mean well maybe we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">this at some point</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">i mean i i do think that yeah the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">brings in simultaneously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">the symbol on right uh the the horrific</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.559" style="s2">doctor the horrifying function and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">homing function</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.559" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">um in a profound way um and that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">so i mean there&#39;s two things i want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">uh one is like i&#39;m trying to get but</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a notion of mortality</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">and isn&#39;t it in the symbolism of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">carrying your cross</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2">that&#39;s analogous to the buddhist notion</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">that mortality isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">death but that the idea that moment by</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">moment i</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m dying there&#39;s there&#39;s little</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">deaths all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">and that if i try to avoid that if i try</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">um get some kind of permanent hold on</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:32.480" style="s2">things i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">i&#39;m just gonna i&#39;m gonna cut myself on</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.480" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">that and then i&#39;m going to cut other</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.839" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">it it it&#39;s again is that uh is that a is</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">that a correct analogy to yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:43.359" style="s2">yeah like if you look at if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">the prayer of jesus the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.359" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">the basic mystical prayer of the church</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">it has two it has two parts right</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">it says has an invocation it says lord</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">jesus christ</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">son of god have mercy on me a sinner and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">there&#39;s this invocation and this</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">remembrance of my own brokenness</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">remembrance of my own incapacity</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">and so those two movements</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">simultaneously they&#39;re the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">will and it&#39;s and it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">and because i think one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">of the trauma of the protestant is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">to a certain extent the idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">weird like the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">you should be pure right that you should</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">but you can&#39;t and so it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">then what what do you do right you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">remain in this strange broken</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:36.079" style="s2">uh broken self but</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">if you rather see it as this this</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.079" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">necessary part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">being a human person and moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">the good then it that then it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">because you you will then see that even</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">the saints</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">lived in you know in the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">temptations that</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">the saints were struggling with their</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">passions you know and those</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">who reached the highest had the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">frustrations you did like they no one</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">pretends to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">if you there isn&#39;t like the holier the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">person that&#39;s holier than now and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">if you read the lives of the saints you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">see the story of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">broken people who their whole life</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">struggle with thoughts and with</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">temptations</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">you know and are delivered by god but</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay if they struggle so</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">for 30 years you know you read crazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">stories of the saints where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">for 40 years he struggled with the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">thought of of fornication and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">would he struggle with that for 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">he actually struggled actively with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">for 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">okay so i need to stop complaining</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">because seriously i&#39;m there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">that i&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">so drew holland talks about this uh in</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">connection with</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">uh plato and socrates he talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">he has a book called finite</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">transcendence uh where he said that but</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">plato was always</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">uh trying to keep this tension alive</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">uh between the relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">um the acceptance of our finitude of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">mortality</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m wondering then</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">if there is something like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">feature of wisdom i know you have your</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">particular christian commitments and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">not trying to trespass on those</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">but you&#39;re also not you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">not being offended which i thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:22.960" style="s2">when i make these connections to other</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">other things you you find them i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.960" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">valuable at least in discussion</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">but that there seems to be a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:34.839" style="s2">which is this kind of tone um</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">between right the aspiration in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.839" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">transcendence and then the deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">acceptance of of our humanity and our</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">mortality and keeping them</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">always together is and there&#39;s a finesse</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">to that there&#39;s a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">shifting i can&#39;t give you a rule or a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">recipe for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">it&#39;s an ongoing ever evolving capacity</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">would you would you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">would you think that yeah it&#39;s a motive</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a mode of being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">a way of being which is what will kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">of hold those two things together and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">think your image of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">is particularly good in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">wisdom at least in scripture at least in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">the bible the way that wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">described seems to really be</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">the capacity for those for let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">the principles or the ideals to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">united with the particular like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like the wisdom always</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">comes as like advice</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">on how to you know how to find a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:29.040" style="s2">woman or how to</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.040" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">money like that&#39;s how wisdom comes but</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">what it&#39;s it&#39;s patterning something</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">which is yeah which is above</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">you know yeah aristotle has that with</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">sophia and from nieces</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">being brought together right sophia is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">your grasping of these universal and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">profound principles</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">and then from esis is how do you make</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">them contextually relevant</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">in a contextually sensitive manner so</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">this now brings me back around then</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">um it sounds like this this deeper</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">on well let&#39;s use the word sin for now</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">this deeper reflection on sin uh you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">affords us what might be missing in what</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">in the demonstrations that that and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">this is part of my concern um that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">you talk about the the you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">inclusion as</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">the sole value um i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">something similar</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">uh in that that justice is the sole</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.839" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">um and a very truncated sense of justice</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.839" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">uh the greek sense of justice was</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">always simultaneously external with</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">others and</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">internal with oneself that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">clear and what we have is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">we get none we get a reduction of all</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:43.599" style="s2">the virtues to justice and then just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">the social aspect of justice hence the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.599" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">name social justice</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re not sure exactly what what</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">that justice entails</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">yeah in terms of its particular like how</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going to manifest well</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">that goes to the point i want to make</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">because i i</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">i i have a concern that we are losing</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">the other virtues</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">i mean the the greeks had at least the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">cardinal four and then the christians</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">add that the next</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">the sacred three and so we at least had</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">set we at least have seven we should be</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">right we at least have seven we should</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">be talking about and we were just</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">talking about one</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">one of the ones that&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">something like a meta virtue which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">um you know i shared the uh what i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">one interpretation of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">that socrates saw that each virtue was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">way of being wise in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">the virtues aren&#39;t separate things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">of course particular ways of enacting</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">and so to me if that argument is good</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">talking about justice without having</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">concern for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">seems to me to be like really really</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">almost oxymoronic um it seems to be um</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">self-contradictory self-undermining and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">kind of thing to be for human beings to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">be embracing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">embracing committing yourself deeply to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">is self-undermining in its foundations</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">um is a very problematic thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">what do you think about that as a person</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">i totally agree and that&#39;s why it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">because the idea of the idea of justice</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">seems to have something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">although it&#39;s ill-defined as well like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">what exactly do we mean by equality and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:22.720" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:24.480" style="s2">because obviously equality is a strange</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.720" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">term because you need a re</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.480" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">you need a a category to declare</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">equality because you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">equality in everything because then</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">everything would just be the same like</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">it it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">so so the equality is a complicated term</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">and so it seems like you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">what is it the the intersectional it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">like the diversity equity</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">inclusion right that&#39;s the those are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">three kind of values that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">mesh together in this idea of justice um</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">and so the the difficulty is of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">that the rev</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">like the revolutionary aspect of it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">what you you also talk about in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">it undermining itself it ends up eating</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:01.359" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">and it ends up eating itself by its very</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.359" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">i hate to say it this way but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">a network to come to the fact that there</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">is no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">equality right in terms of action total</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:18.880" style="s2">right because it does what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">like everybody&#39;s smarter</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">stupider than others some are taller</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">some are shorter you know and and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s individually true and it&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">different categories and different</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">cities and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s difference you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">you can&#39;t have equality and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">this like weird desire for equality</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">ends up being ends up being a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">power play it seems</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:42.240" style="s2">not not really a desire for equality but</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">a desire for power</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.240" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">so so i wonder if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">going on here a kind of displacement</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">and and this this is going to be really</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">you have to move very carefully here</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:43:00.400" style="s2">um so i think what people</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">want to do sorry the sun&#39;s pompous but</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to talk it seems it seems</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">plausible to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">to propose that what people want to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">is reduce the suffering of pain and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:15.359" style="s2">distress</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">and then they and then they they</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.359" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">have cl they&#39;re making a claim that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">most suffering is just distress or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">right is caused by inequality</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">and of course there is truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">what you know when resources are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">being distributed</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:38.079" style="s2">as fairly as they can and fairness is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">not the same thing as equality this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.079" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">right because justice is also supposed</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">to be about fairness not just about</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.560" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">um and so when</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">we we do cause we cause unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">so so so let me try and give you a bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">slight riff on this i see</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">um the the the left</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">as really sensitive to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">that human beings are so i&#39;ll use a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">greek term here but you&#39;ll you&#39;ll find a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">christian uh analog i&#39;m sure the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">beings are really subject to fate</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">that there is just shitty things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">happen to human beings because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">finite and they&#39;re limited</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.119" style="s2">and the world is an overwhelming machine</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">and there&#39;s historical forces and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">material forces</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">you know you might even say powers and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">principalities that work right</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">and people are just subject right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">that we we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">and that people therefore deserve our</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">aid</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">even if they haven&#39;t earned it because</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">if we don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">we are ign and this is like the aspect</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">of sin again we&#39;re ignoring the fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">that we are finite</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">and we are subject to forces beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">control the left gets that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">and i think the right tends to forget</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">that and that&#39;s why the right often</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">comes off</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">as cruel but what the what but right but</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">what the left forgets</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">is what the right is no matter how you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">positively they do it and stupidly they</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">do it is the right choice to remind</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">people that even though we are subject</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">to fate and people</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">should be aided beyond what they deserve</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.319" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">or have earned</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">right human beings are nevertheless also</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">responsible they need to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">virtue because every human being is</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">beset by self-deception and the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">person that can get out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">it i i can&#39;t get you out of your own</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">self-deception i can give you guides</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">but you have to go through it like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">have to go through it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">i can&#39;t do that for you right it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">if to put it in a slogan you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">left remembers fade and forgets virtue</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">and the right remembers virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">forgets fate</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">and and so so</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to get at is how</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">how how could we change this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">about justice so that we could put it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">into what it was supposed to be paired</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">with which was sophism</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">right we pursued the external justice of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">trying to reduce the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">of others that are caused by history and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">fate</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">has to always be counterbalanced by</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">sophism</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">the cultivation of the inner justice of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">and that those for the greeks it was it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">it was axiomatic that you had to talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">about those two things together</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">somehow we have gotten to the point</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">where we only talk about one side of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">and i find that also a very lopsided</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">thing sorry that was a long thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">but i you know you&#39;re a deep thinker i</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">want to give you a lot to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">yeah well it seems like the way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">at least when i look at the way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">things happen in in the bible</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">and kind of the way the emphasis that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.119" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">christianity has put on it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">obviously it christianity is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">preoccupied with the poor preoccupied</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">with the poor in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">broadest way you can interpret that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">those that have less</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">and those that have little right uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">poor in terms of their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say spiritual poor or it&#39;s poor</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">even physically in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">poor or it&#39;s the sick or it&#39;s those that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">have no recourse like the widow and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">orphan</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">this is something that christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">extremely uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">concerned about but the way that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">christianity seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">concerned itself about it mostly is to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">ask those who have to give</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">right to put responsibility on those who</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">have to care for those</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">who need to be cared for sure rather</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">than tell those who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">lacking to go get theirs right</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">yeah to like to take it from those who</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s really the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">the revolutionary mindset</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">and the christian mindset and some</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">people might say well why</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">why can&#39;t it happen like why can&#39;t those</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">that have less</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">just take right take take it back and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">the reason is because the reason is very</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">practical reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">it&#39;s because it&#39;s a self-defeating</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">pattern yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">the pattern which will which will</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">destroy itself because</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s always someone who has less than</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">you and there&#39;s always someone who will</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">be there to take from you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">even though you think you are the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">who you&#39;re the one who has the last and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">so you take from that one above you but</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s always someone below you who has</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">less than you and will take from you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">as soon as you take from that one above</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">the power especially then you become the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">you become the one who is now in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">you know who&#39;s it who&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">shocked like the story of robespierre is</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">the most classic example of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">happening um and so that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">way that christianity deals with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">and there are consequences if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">um and the consequences need to be kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">of put in the right</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">position the way i kind of say it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:54.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t excuse the peasants for killing</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">the king</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.000" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">right but i still think it&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">king&#39;s fault</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">right it&#39;s still it&#39;s still because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">king didn&#39;t care for the peasants that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">the peasants ended up killing him</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m not justifying the peasant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">actions but i am saying that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">if you don&#39;t care for the poor at some</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s going to happen like the the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">people will come and take</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">theirs if you don&#39;t care for them but</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not morally justified that they do</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that makes sense no it</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">does i get what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">but what i was what i was trying to well</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">maybe this way of bringing it back</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">yeah like like i&#39;m trying to get to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">notion that</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t just about equality or even equity</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">i&#39;m trying like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">yeah you know you&#39;re right jesus does</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">jesus both you see jesus and the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is they both do</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">this they both</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:53.200" style="s2">criticize equally something like cruelty</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">and something like hypocrisy right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.200" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is the the what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">in here as we&#39;re trying to encompass the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">nature of human beings is that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">social justice especially if it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:10.319" style="s2">just the pursuit of equality</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">does not have the machinery to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.319" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">jesus and the buddha are neither left</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">nor right like it doesn&#39;t make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">right or yeah exactly but these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">making sense at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">exactly right and so the the point is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">in in a very profound way they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they&#39;re non-political</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">but they&#39;re they&#39;re if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">they&#39;re meta-political oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">right they&#39;re trying to get at what what</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">are the values</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">or the virtues people should be aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">to that are the most responsible and i</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">mean both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">responsible to human nature right</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what i see them doing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">what i&#39;m not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">in this movement i&#39;m not seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">of you know like we said of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">balance these things together of getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">a deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">understanding of human nature i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">hearing a very very superficial</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">theory about human nature and human</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:09.760" style="s2">and human culture and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:11.119" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that the version of</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.760" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.119" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">justice is what really concerns me is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">this version of justice it sounds so</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">and and that means that to me means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">got to be wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">i mean what i get from all the great</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">philosophers is justice real justice</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">i mean john rawls writes this huge book</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">like real justice is hard it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">hard because human beings</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">are so incredibly complex and they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">as we&#39;ve been talking about here these</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">you know these opposing</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">forces and poles at work in them</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">that was the point i was trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re totally right uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">like if you look at this if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">how christ deals with it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">you know we talked about responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">in you can see the way that christ talks</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">about like he talks to the pharisees and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">he says you&#39;re a bunch of hypocrites</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">and he he talks to woe to the rich if</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t care for the poor</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">and woe to you know uh and blessed are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">those who are poor for they will receive</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">like there&#39;s all this and is but he also</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">has several parables where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">the poor who don&#39;t care for what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.119" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">and the consequences of that like he</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">also has that he also</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:24.079" style="s2">has the parable of the talents where he</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">talks about the servant who receives</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">something and doesn&#39;t make it fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">has to face the consequences of not</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">making fruitful that which he has and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">christ</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">talks of talks at all levels at the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">time you know i always say</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">like you said he&#39;s meta-political he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">he&#39;s a judge and a victim</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">he&#39;s the king and the servant he&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">these things at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.440" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">uh in a very paradoxical way and so he</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">kind of transcends politics and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">interesting to watch the politician</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">the pop the politically minded because</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">they see in christ</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">a kind of weird mirror of themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">the people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">see christ as a kind of revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">yeah yeah bigger and the people on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">right see christ as a get your act</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.119" style="s2">type figure and it&#39;s like well you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:12.839" style="s2">neither of those really yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">that was very well said jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.839" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">so what to do with this what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">this weird i the way that i think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">way to understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">you know you talked a little bit in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">before our conversation started about</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:27.760" style="s2">the inevitability of religio and i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.760" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">the way that&#39;s exactly where i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">go yeah this whole discussion</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">seems to be pointing right it&#39;s making a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">i think plausible argument about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">inevitability</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">of religion the unavoidability of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">religio in human</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">endeavor and you made uh in human</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">existence and you made this point</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">and i wanted to give you the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">to expand on it you made a point of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">criticizing the the new atheists</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:57.280" style="s2">um you know uh in in how they were sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">of saying if we could just get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.280" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:02.000" style="s2">uh you know and what they did is you</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">they identified religion with a you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">belief in the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:08.400" style="s2">etc etc and if we just got rid of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">false beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">uh then that would be it and then your</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">point is well the people that are in</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">these marches</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:15.599" style="s2">they&#39;re not advocating anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">necessarily supernatural something</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.599" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">perhaps transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">but not supernatural etc they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">doing all but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">look at the religious behavior look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">how comprehensive and powerful it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">and look at how much it&#39;s a response to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">the way the covid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">accelerated the meaning crisis you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">and so you and you you made that and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">was sort of a very brief thing it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:37.440" style="s2">two or three minutes in the video but i</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">wanted to give you and i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.440" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">good context</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.079" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">you and i and discussion i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.599" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">give you the opportunity to expand on</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">yeah well my criticism of the new</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">atheists you know and i i would use</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">stephen pinker as the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">is the main example just because of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">kinds of books he&#39;s written and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">of statements he&#39;s made about</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">enlightenment and this kind of progress</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">and everything um</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">is that and i think that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">doing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">is a much better like the cogsi approach</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">and the cognitive science approach is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">much better</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">approach to this because there is there</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">an understanding of what a human being</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">is in a in a deeper way</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">and and there&#39;s an understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">reasons why we have certain patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">certain things exist within us and one</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">of what the new atheists</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">seem to want to do is to see the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.119" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">reason and then want to kind of box the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:32.640" style="s2">human being in reason</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">and see everything which is outside of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.640" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">reason as</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">the thing to get rid of as the bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">to get rid of there&#39;s our original sin</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">is everything that&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">reason needs to be eliminated but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">problem is that you can&#39;t eliminate it</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">you know and and there&#39;s a kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">utopian vision</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">and the example i always use is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">example of sleep</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">you could say and reason and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:56.799" style="s2">and awaken this you know and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">kind of this more</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.799" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">this other affect of us in sleep it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">good way to understand it it&#39;s as if i</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">told you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:04.799" style="s2">you could be way more productive if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t sleep</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.799" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">like you just have to not sleep and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">you could be awake all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that be amazing like</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">then you would imagine how much progress</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">you would make like imagine how far you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">would go if you would just stay awake</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">all the time but the reality is that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">can&#39;t that&#39;s not just not part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">being a human being and so these other</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.799" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">patterns that we have are there</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">and so and they&#39;re extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">and if you try to get rid of them</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">what they do is they kind of they go</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">down for a little while and then they</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">come back like a monster</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll swallow you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">what we&#39;re those are the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">we saw in</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">the in the french revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:44.720" style="s2">russian revolution all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">the kind of end of atheist cycle where</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.720" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">all of a sudden the patterns come back</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:51.200" style="s2">like a big monster to devour you and now</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing very similar things as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.200" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a secular religious uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">manifestation and it&#39;s akin to the one</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">we saw in the french revolution</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s akin to the one we saw in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">russian revolution and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:07.599" style="s2">and and i always want to say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">the the people who kind of made fun of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.599" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">jordan peterson talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s happening right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:15.359" style="s2">happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">look at what&#39;s going on and you can just</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.359" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">pooh-pooh it you can toss it to the side</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s the same pattern happening</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">again and the reason for the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">is the same like the denial of</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">sorry i get excited then i just throw</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">me too me too the the denial of certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">aspects of the human person</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:39.200" style="s2">is going to come back yeah and so the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.200" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">idea is what do you do like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">deal with it and to me</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">that&#39;s why i think that that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:49.359" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">have a conscious having a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.359" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">aspect to you that&#39;s why ritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">conscious ritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">is is important because</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">ritual will be there you can&#39;t avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">now the question is whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">part of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:07.119" style="s2">integrated or whether or not you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">slave to ritualized behavior</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.119" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">and kind of scapegoat and identity</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:14.559" style="s2">forming behavior that that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">that is just part of existence i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.559" end="00:58:19.280" style="s2">that was very beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">said yeah they i i agree i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.280" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">on the first point you made it with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">you know the cog sigh and all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">on relevance realization and those</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">aspects</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">that are pre-rational and how how</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:31.119" style="s2">primordial they are</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">and the importance of ritual like so</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.119" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">for those of you i mean you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">this video you know this work</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">and so there&#39;s arguments there and thank</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">you jonathan for gesturing to them</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">and then as you as you were building on</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">that i thought of this scene and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">you&#39;ll probably be able to riff on this</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:47.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s from mythologies from</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">a science fiction classic uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.119" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">journey to the center of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">and um especially in the movie version</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">count saknason who&#39;s the villain</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">um they think you&#39;ll see how this</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">connects in just a sec</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">they come to him and they say</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">don&#39;t you sleep and he said i never</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">sleep i hate those little slices of</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">and he represents exactly no and just</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:09.599" style="s2">right so the journey to the center of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.599" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">which of course has all kinds of mythic</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">meanings attached to that right but and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">but he&#39;s the villain and notice how he</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">brings together</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">like your analogy and how it connects</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:24.799" style="s2">back to uh unwillingness to accept his</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">his humanness his mortality there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.799" end="00:59:28.319" style="s2">hubris in here</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:30.799" style="s2">and his and that cycles us back again to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.319" end="00:59:33.040" style="s2">this refusal to accept our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:33.920" style="s2">to re uh it&#39;s ultimately it&#39;s again the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">same kind of</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">i think they might also have been</p>

<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">commandment or the very first place in</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:10.799" style="s2">scripture where it talks about</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">something which is holy uh is</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">in the the description of creation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:16.079" style="s2">so you have six</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">days then you have the seventh day which</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">is the day of rest</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s the day which is set aside for</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:22.880" style="s2">god right it&#39;s the holy day</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:25.520" style="s2">and and right there in genesis it says</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.880" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why we we follow the sabbath</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">now that there&#39;s a mystery in that which</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">is very profound</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">and the mystery is that it&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:37.920" style="s2">mystery that the new atheists are</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">impo incapable of seeing which is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.920" end="01:01:40.799" style="s2">the way that the world is made in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">way that consciousness is made and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.799" end="01:01:46.079" style="s2">way that reason is made</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">is because it&#39;s a patterning system it</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.079" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">can never encompass everything</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">right it it can be coherent but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">cannot be complete</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">and you need to leave a bit out</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">for completeness to manifest itself like</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:03.680" style="s2">in its in its mystery so you need to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">leave a bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.680" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">on the edge that is not closed that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.280" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">tied up that isn&#39;t accounted for there</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">has to be some aspects which are not</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.839" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">accounted for</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">if you try to account for everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">the you know that&#39;s the that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">dangerous thing right it&#39;s the yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">if you also try to see that which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">accounted for as totality</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">which is the sin of satan which is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:34.480" style="s2">sin of pride which is the sin of adam</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the hubris and then then you fall</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.480" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">because that aspect which you which</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:40.079" style="s2">you&#39;re which you which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">supposed to be unaccounted for which</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.079" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to ignore</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">is still there right and and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">the fascinating aspect of that margin or</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:51.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">the let&#39;s say the the seventh day is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.760" end="01:02:55.359" style="s2">that there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">it has two parts to it it has a part</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.359" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">the the unfathomable</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.280" end="01:03:04.400" style="s2">of creation right the the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">completeness of creation</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.400" end="01:03:09.359" style="s2">but it also points to the infinite</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a secrecy in it which also</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.359" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">points to the infinite which is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">both the day of rest</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">but also the day set aside for god at</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s both death and the source of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:23.119" style="s2">life at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting your invocation</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">of godall i mean i take god&#39;s theorem</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">that you can&#39;t have it both complete</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.039" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">and consistent to be an example of what</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:34.079" style="s2">i meant earlier by mortality</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.839" end="01:03:35.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the mortality in the heart of any</p>

<p begin="01:03:35.839" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">or you know heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the mortality in the</p>

<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">observation or investigation</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">and more and more of these right and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">the the the history and philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">the last two centuries have been in</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">philosophy and science at least the more</p>

<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">in the discovery of this i&#39;d like your</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:02.799" style="s2">because it brings me back around and you</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">deliberately a lot but you&#39;re invoking</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:09.599" style="s2">to i heard lebanon when you were</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">comparing totality to infinity because</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.599" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">he has a book around that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:14.559" style="s2">right and how infinity is not the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.480" end="01:04:15.760" style="s2">thing as totality because totality is</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.559" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">the pretense that you have both</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">consistency and completeness</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">that&#39;s my way of understanding it and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">and therefore it</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">like if you take the golde uh gold&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:28.880" style="s2">argument seriously and you should</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:29.760" style="s2">right that is always a dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.880" end="01:04:32.720" style="s2">pretense</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">and that the problem with any any system</p>

<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:39.599" style="s2">claims to be complete and consistent</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:40.480" style="s2">is that it is actually a deep form of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.599" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.480" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">oh yeah that&#39;s for sure so</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.039" end="01:04:48.640" style="s2">i mean and this is what you know this</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:50.000" style="s2">was this is the great for all of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">criticisms i have of them</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.000" end="01:04:52.880" style="s2">this is the great thing that claims</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:53.440" style="s2">comes out of the whole pragmatism</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.839" style="s2">i will in another series but the point</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.039" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to get to here is</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.839" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a shadow side of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:13.920" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a negative version of it which</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.920" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">is strategies of eradication</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s an argument and i&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:07:18.319" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">but once you enter into that strategy of</p>

<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">techno states where you you are develop</p>

<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">you know to to limit that or not seen</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.760" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">before yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very frightening situation a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">clear example of that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.440" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">the proposal that we we start tracking</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">everybody&#39;s movement</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:57.199" style="s2">no no no i i i want to make an analogy</p>

<p begin="01:08:57.199" end="01:08:59.440" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.600" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">as much as we can ameliorate it but with</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.440" end="01:09:04.159" style="s2">wisdom toggling against</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">against over empowering the state and</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t push for eradication we prove</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">we push for amelioration</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:18.000" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t cost us too much our</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:19.600" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.000" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the same attitude we should</p>

<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">real evil of racism that we should try</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:30.560" style="s2">which and we should continue to try to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">ameliorate it but we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.560" end="01:09:33.759" style="s2">you know i talk a lot about how you</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.319" end="01:09:35.759" style="s2">frame the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.759" end="01:09:36.799" style="s2">way more important than the method about</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.759" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">act you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">about actually solving it should we be</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:43.679" style="s2">adopting a mindset that is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:45.520" style="s2">totalitarian kind of eradication</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.679" end="01:09:47.440" style="s2">about something like racism it strikes</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.520" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">me that that but that argument by</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:54.159" style="s2">means there is a a sense in which we</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.159" end="01:09:56.640" style="s2">i hope</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make me a racist and what</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.640" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen is like i saw the interview</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">with don lemon and i forget the name of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:06.159" style="s2">the actor and he was trying to say</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.159" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">trying to say i&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.920" end="01:10:12.719" style="s2">that you know some of the leaders of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:14.640" style="s2">movement are going too far too extreme</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">that&#39;s all he&#39;s proposing and he was he</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.640" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">was treated with smugness</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">and and and dismissed and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:23.600" style="s2">and then this horrible argument by lemon</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.840" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">you know well people accuse martin</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.600" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">luther king of being too extreme as if</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.920" end="01:10:30.000" style="s2">well are you saying that because</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">sometimes people have misused that word</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">that every time they use it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">misusing it that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">stupid argument can we have a better</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:39.120" style="s2">argument please</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:40.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s like if we can&#39;t even bring up</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.120" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.400" end="01:10:44.560" style="s2">that the that we might be framing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">attempt to achieve a</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.560" end="01:10:50.000" style="s2">goal a lot of evil that i fully support</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">then i think we&#39;re we&#39;re in a very very</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.000" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">bad place i think we&#39;re getting into a</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">very bad place yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.719" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">and you&#39;re right because what one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">things covet did</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">was awaken in us this</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:05.679" style="s2">this this pattern of infection</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:07.120" style="s2">right yes yeah and it awakened in us the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.679" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">pattern of infection and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.120" end="01:11:13.600" style="s2">desire to exclude and eradicate yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">and now it&#39;s being politicized like not</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.600" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">not the kovid like</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:18.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s weird because you can see that</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:20.719" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:22.159" style="s2">like there&#39;s no narrative connection</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">between coped and def</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.159" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">and floyd but there is a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.000" end="01:11:26.239" style="s2">connection yeah and you can see that in</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:28.239" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.239" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s awakened the pattern and now</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.239" end="01:11:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s playing out in the political sphere</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">well i mean isn&#39;t that a case again i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:37.199" style="s2">talking at the latent level not the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:37.760" style="s2">manifest label but that seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.199" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.760" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like a clear case of what</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:42.080" style="s2">a psychodynamic person would call</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">displacement</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.080" end="01:11:45.280" style="s2">right that yeah that you&#39;re you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like you said</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.280" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">kobe puts you like you&#39;re suddenly in</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">the old testament and i don&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">pejoratively right but you know you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">this ubiquitous threatening things out</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:54.159" style="s2">there in the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">and you have to adopt this very you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.159" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">very you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:59.600" style="s2">uh insular purity code and then you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:01.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know what is going to strike you</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.600" end="01:12:02.960" style="s2">and and then right and they might be</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.679" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">infected</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.960" end="01:12:09.360" style="s2">and and you know and and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">but now what we can do is we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.360" end="01:12:12.719" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do anything about the covid</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.280" end="01:12:14.400" style="s2">but i think what your suggestion is but</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.719" end="01:12:16.560" style="s2">i can do something about this over here</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.400" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">can you do something about yeah and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.560" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">danger about the danger of the racist</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.400" end="01:12:22.159" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">is the the limit of it because the limit</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.159" end="01:12:27.040" style="s2">is the problem with racism is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:29.360" style="s2">this invisible thing in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.040" end="01:12:30.400" style="s2">it ends up being thoughts and feelings</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.360" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">in people</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.400" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">yes and the idea that you can reprogram</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:37.040" style="s2">someone and that you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:38.480" style="s2">move towards the eradication of thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.040" end="01:12:40.239" style="s2">and feelings i mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.480" end="01:12:41.520" style="s2">we know where that leads like we know</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.239" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">where that goes and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.520" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">because it can&#39;t happen then like we</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:47.120" style="s2">said like i said before but it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">to end up looking like it&#39;s scapegoating</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.120" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to choose some we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:53.120" style="s2">going to find</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:53.920" style="s2">examples that we can drag out in public</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.120" end="01:12:55.760" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.920" end="01:12:57.040" style="s2">and uh have struggle session watch</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.760" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">struggle sessions and</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.040" end="01:13:01.840" style="s2">have them be humiliated in public so</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">that we can deal with the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.840" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">eradicating something which is which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">unconscious bias like it&#39;s unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:12.400" style="s2">so you can how can you</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:17.120" style="s2">eradicate it well i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:19.120" style="s2">trying to eradicate that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.120" end="01:13:21.040" style="s2">i mean given what we&#39;ve argued isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.120" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">that the same it&#39;s ultimately committing</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.040" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">you at some level to eradicating</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:26.880" style="s2">the machinery of humanity that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:29.199" style="s2">right uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:29.199" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.000" end="01:13:35.199" style="s2">so let&#39;s say that this is i&#39;ve been more</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.199" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">and more attracted to renigiriz in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.199" end="01:13:37.120" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:38.239" style="s2">year i would say you know just because</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.120" end="01:13:39.199" style="s2">of everything that&#39;s happened and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.239" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.199" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">seeing that his analysis of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.280" end="01:13:45.360" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:46.560" style="s2">is is really one of the wisest in terms</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.360" end="01:13:47.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.560" end="01:13:49.760" style="s2">the way that he interpret what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.920" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">happening and intersectionality i mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.760" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">he passed away</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">i think around 2010 or maybe a bit later</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.880" style="s2">um you know he talked about into i saw a</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:13:59.440" style="s2">quote of his in 2007 where he talked</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.880" end="01:14:01.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.440" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">the machine of antichrist which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:05.920" style="s2">ramping up and he saw</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;re seeing he said it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.920" end="01:14:10.400" style="s2">be infinite victimhood</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:11.199" style="s2">looking for infinite scapegoat and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.400" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.199" end="01:14:14.880" style="s2">perpetual wheel of victimhood which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">looking perpetually</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.880" end="01:14:18.239" style="s2">for more and more scapegoats like almost</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">like a self-devouring</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.239" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">machine and so we&#39;re seeing it that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:25.199" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.760" end="01:14:25.760" style="s2">is like i hate to i know you dislike</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.199" end="01:14:28.560" style="s2">when i</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.760" end="01:14:31.440" style="s2">push it too far but the solution is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.560" end="01:14:31.440" style="s2">the image of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.520" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">the scapegoat being the murderer and</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.600" end="01:14:37.120" style="s2">this and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:37.920" style="s2">victim at the same time like identifying</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.120" end="01:14:39.840" style="s2">with christ</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.920" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">and identifying with those that killed</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.840" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">him identifying with the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.280" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">exclude and the reality of also being</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:50.320" style="s2">excluded to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">like those two things together if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.320" end="01:14:53.520" style="s2">can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:55.360" style="s2">you can integrate them properly and not</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.520" end="01:14:57.679" style="s2">in a weird disorderly manner</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.360" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">can help you have compassion for those</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.679" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">excluded but can help you also</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">understand that you are all one of those</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:05.760" style="s2">who do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:09.040" style="s2">all the time yes you&#39;re always doing it</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.760" end="01:15:09.840" style="s2">but this this is what i meant i i i i</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.040" end="01:15:11.679" style="s2">think there&#39;s power in</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.840" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">our argument i&#39;ve only read the one book</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.679" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m not completely</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:18.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the one i saw satan fall like</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:18.560" style="s2">like but the idea that you can explode</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.080" end="01:15:19.760" style="s2">the gr</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.560" end="01:15:21.520" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to use some of my</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.760" end="01:15:22.800" style="s2">terms you can explode the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.520" end="01:15:24.719" style="s2">cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.800" end="01:15:26.400" style="s2">of scapegoating uh and that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.719" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">christian mythos does that</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.400" end="01:15:29.840" style="s2">i thought that was one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">powerful arguments uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.840" end="01:15:33.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s a new argument to as far as i</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:35.360" style="s2">know one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.679" end="01:15:37.280" style="s2">apologetic arguments for christianity</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.360" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">that i had heard in quite some time so i</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.280" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:43.199" style="s2">is a good point that you brought up um</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:44.640" style="s2">but but it does i think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.199" end="01:15:47.440" style="s2">situated within this larger</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.640" end="01:15:49.120" style="s2">past again which we keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.440" end="01:15:50.239" style="s2">of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.120" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">get to a place where we can</p>

<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:55.840" style="s2">because one of the ways in which you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.040" end="01:15:58.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.840" end="01:15:59.520" style="s2">one of the ways in which you can address</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.640" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.520" end="01:16:04.719" style="s2">thoughts and feelings is by inspiring</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:08.080" style="s2">them to aspire to virtue</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.719" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">rather than trying to eradicate you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.080" end="01:16:11.280" style="s2">uh try to inspire the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:14.560" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.280" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">and and this has been uh to my mind</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.560" end="01:16:18.159" style="s2">you know a very very successful strategy</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:20.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.159" end="01:16:22.400" style="s2">where i&#39;ve been talking a lot recently</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.800" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">and i cure the dawn did the meaning wave</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.400" end="01:16:24.400" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:26.560" style="s2">about stealing the culture and i</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.400" end="01:16:28.159" style="s2">actually use uh christianity as a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.560" end="01:16:29.360" style="s2">primary example of that christianity</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.159" end="01:16:31.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t try and over</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.360" end="01:16:32.560" style="s2">throw uh the political structure what it</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.840" end="01:16:34.320" style="s2">does is</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.560" end="01:16:36.000" style="s2">it steals the culture it creates an</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.320" end="01:16:39.120" style="s2">entirely different culture</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.000" end="01:16:39.760" style="s2">from the bottom up and then because the</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.120" end="01:16:41.440" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.760" end="01:16:43.760" style="s2">to my mind what the french revolution</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.440" end="01:16:44.560" style="s2">shows is you can radically transform the</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.760" end="01:16:46.320" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t transform the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.320" end="01:16:49.199" style="s2">underlying cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:53.280" style="s2">and normativity</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.199" end="01:16:54.960" style="s2">nothing is fundamentally going to change</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.280" end="01:16:56.480" style="s2">yeah you just change the you just change</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.960" end="01:16:57.040" style="s2">the ones who are holding the reigns and</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.480" end="01:16:59.120" style="s2">you use that</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.040" end="01:17:00.400" style="s2">you circulate you circulate the elites</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.120" end="01:17:03.040" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.400" end="01:17:03.679" style="s2">and so whereas what christianity does is</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.040" end="01:17:06.000" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.679" end="01:17:07.840" style="s2">is is it it builds a new civilization</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.000" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">buddhism does the same thing right a boo</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.840" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">it builds a new civilization islam does</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:15.440" style="s2">the same thing it builds a new</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">civilization and and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.440" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">that brings us and we don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:20.400" style="s2">time uh i suppose but so that brings me</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:22.800" style="s2">towards the third point which</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.400" end="01:17:24.719" style="s2">you said you you know you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.800" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">despair of knowing what to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.719" end="01:17:32.400" style="s2">um and i&#39;m wondering if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:33.280" style="s2">i i i i i sorry i realized i might be</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.400" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">daring the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.280" end="01:17:38.320" style="s2">prehostess thing of proposing uh some uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:39.679" style="s2">sort of a christian thing to a christian</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.320" end="01:17:43.199" style="s2">which is a ridiculous thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.679" end="01:17:46.239" style="s2">um but i gave you all of those examples</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:48.560" style="s2">uh and to my mind of the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.239" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">well isn&#39;t the response to do as much as</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:53.679" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.920" end="01:17:55.760" style="s2">to engage in building the next culture</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.679" end="01:17:57.600" style="s2">and that sounds preposterous but a</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.760" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">commitment to that kind of thing seems</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.600" end="01:18:01.679" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">to be the most responsible response</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.679" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">to the depth of the situation we are in</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:11.280" style="s2">yeah no i think so i think i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:12.640" style="s2">i would say on a personal level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.280" end="01:18:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just it i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.640" end="01:18:16.400" style="s2">love god love your neighbor is is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.480" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">pretty pretty good thing to live by in</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:20.400" style="s2">in the immediate reality and not</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">abstract categories to deal</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.400" end="01:18:23.760" style="s2">you know to to love the people that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:24.960" style="s2">that you encounter with to see in them</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.760" end="01:18:27.120" style="s2">the face of god</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.960" end="01:18:28.239" style="s2">is something that will transform at</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.120" end="01:18:30.800" style="s2">least your life</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.239" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s harder in terms of like a social</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.800" end="01:18:37.120" style="s2">responsibility for sure myself</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:38.400" style="s2">the way that i the way that i frame it</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.120" end="01:18:41.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m doing what i&#39;m doing what</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.400" end="01:18:44.239" style="s2">you said is that i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.120" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">help people see the the grammar of</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.239" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">culture or see the pattern and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:50.239" style="s2">of course one of the things i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:51.120" style="s2">emphasizing the most is the importance</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.239" end="01:18:52.800" style="s2">of the margin</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.120" end="01:18:55.120" style="s2">and talking about the margin in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.800" end="01:18:56.400" style="s2">balanced way so that you neither have</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.120" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">the desire</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.400" end="01:18:59.840" style="s2">to because both sides want to eliminate</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.960" end="01:19:01.600" style="s2">the margin</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.840" end="01:19:03.440" style="s2">everybody wants to eliminate it they</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.600" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">want to eliminate the margin either by</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.440" end="01:19:07.199" style="s2">making it</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">the same as the center by integrating</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.199" end="01:19:09.679" style="s2">all the marginal</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:12.239" style="s2">aspects and making them equal to</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.679" end="01:19:14.960" style="s2">everything else or by eradication</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.239" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">or by cutting it off and that&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.960" end="01:19:19.840" style="s2">are that&#39;s the real problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:20.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s the question we had during the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.840" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.640" end="01:19:24.640" style="s2">the first wave of violence of the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:26.239" style="s2">century you had two sides you had one</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.640" end="01:19:29.199" style="s2">side which wanted to create</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.239" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">an equal utopia and one which wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.199" end="01:19:32.640" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:33.280" style="s2">a hierarchical utopia that cut off the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.640" end="01:19:35.440" style="s2">margin</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.280" end="01:19:36.480" style="s2">that burned it off and so and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.440" end="01:19:37.920" style="s2">facing the same</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.480" end="01:19:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like we didn&#39;t deal with it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.920" end="01:19:41.600" style="s2">facing the same problem now</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.920" end="01:19:43.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing the one side now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.600" end="01:19:45.679" style="s2">seeing the we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.440" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">the the side that wants everything to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.679" end="01:19:49.840" style="s2">equal</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.480" end="01:19:51.760" style="s2">but i always tell people</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.840" end="01:19:53.600" style="s2">when the nazis came to germany they were</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.760" end="01:19:54.239" style="s2">on the verge of a communist revolution</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:19:55.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.239" end="01:19:58.560" style="s2">the pendulum doesn&#39;t move in one</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.840" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">direction no the pendulum swings and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.560" end="01:20:02.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:05.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a scary thing to watch well but</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.080" end="01:20:08.159" style="s2">this is part of the way in which again</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.679" end="01:20:09.760" style="s2">the the way in which this lack of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.159" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">lack of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.760" end="01:20:15.679" style="s2">of of a dynamical nuance in thinking</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:17.120" style="s2">um so you know leo ferrara and i talked</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.679" end="01:20:20.480" style="s2">about this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.120" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">you in in living systems and right you</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.480" end="01:20:24.159" style="s2">you see opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:26.639" style="s2">and i&#39;ve argued right and that what and</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.159" end="01:20:28.800" style="s2">opponent processing means</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.639" end="01:20:30.080" style="s2">this is the way you deal with trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.800" end="01:20:31.199" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been talking about trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.080" end="01:20:32.400" style="s2">all the way through right you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.199" end="01:20:33.760" style="s2">opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.400" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">you like your parasympathetic and</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:37.120" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system like the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system is biased</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.120" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">it tries to interpret everything as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.560" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">threat or an opportunity and it arouses</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:42.560" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:43.920" style="s2">and the parasympathetic system is biased</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.560" end="01:20:45.280" style="s2">and it tries to interpret everything as</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.920" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">a signal that you should relax</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.280" end="01:20:49.280" style="s2">and calm down and and they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:50.639" style="s2">their biases work in opposite direction</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.280" end="01:20:51.199" style="s2">but they&#39;re functionally integrated</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.639" end="01:20:52.800" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.199" end="01:20:55.440" style="s2">because that&#39;s how you get the most</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.800" end="01:20:58.000" style="s2">self-corrective system</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.440" end="01:20:59.440" style="s2">and what we were supposed to have you</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.000" end="01:21:00.880" style="s2">can see this in dewey right</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:03.120" style="s2">because we&#39;re supposed to have a point</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.880" end="01:21:05.760" style="s2">processing but what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.120" end="01:21:06.239" style="s2">devolved into is adversarial processing</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.760" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.239" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">right and this is the eradication idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">the ad it says zero now it&#39;s a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.560" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">game i&#39;ve given up the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:14.719" style="s2">self-correction</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.800" end="01:21:16.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve given up the idea of commitment to</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.719" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">a process that you and i even though we</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.320" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:21.760" style="s2">we can we can commit to like you and i</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:23.840" style="s2">do in dialogue we have disagreements</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.760" end="01:21:25.040" style="s2">but we see the potential that we can</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.840" end="01:21:26.880" style="s2">correct each other</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.040" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">in valuable ways that we mutually</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.880" end="01:21:31.280" style="s2">appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:34.000" style="s2">right there was that commitment and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.280" end="01:21:37.040" style="s2">commitment to that process has been lost</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.000" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">like the fact that most americans</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.040" end="01:21:40.320" style="s2">are are more distrusting of the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">party</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.320" end="01:21:43.920" style="s2">than they are a foreign threat like what</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:45.920" style="s2">the heck does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:48.960" style="s2">right what like what does that mean to</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.920" end="01:21:52.159" style="s2">you like like</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.960" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">and so the adversarial eradicate the</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.159" end="01:21:55.120" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:56.239" style="s2">destroy the other zero-sun game</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.120" end="01:22:00.400" style="s2">mentality</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.239" end="01:22:02.400" style="s2">i think has made the process</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.400" end="01:22:03.840" style="s2">i think it&#39;s broken yeah i i think the</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.400" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">process is broken</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.840" end="01:22:09.760" style="s2">and and so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.880" end="01:22:11.280" style="s2">i i i don&#39;t see how i mean and layman</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.760" end="01:22:11.679" style="s2">pascal and others they disagree with me</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.280" end="01:22:13.840" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.679" end="01:22:14.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how to work within that um</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.840" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">in a way</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.800" end="01:22:18.000" style="s2">uh and so that&#39;s what i mean by steal</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:19.920" style="s2">the culture that</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.000" end="01:22:21.679" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know if working within that</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.920" end="01:22:24.639" style="s2">machinery is a viable</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.679" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">strategy i think no strategy has to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.639" end="01:22:28.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">you know jonathan i was at a conference</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.400" end="01:22:32.880" style="s2">uh two weeks ago uh called the movement</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.040" end="01:22:33.920" style="s2">summit and there&#39;s all these communities</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.880" end="01:22:35.920" style="s2">of practice</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.920" end="01:22:37.760" style="s2">springing up everywhere or trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.920" end="01:22:40.800" style="s2">integrate mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.760" end="01:22:41.920" style="s2">and movement practices and discourse</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.800" end="01:22:45.040" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.920" end="01:22:45.840" style="s2">um and and so many of them and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.040" end="01:22:46.960" style="s2">these people</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.840" end="01:22:48.239" style="s2">and they&#39;re all and they all want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.960" end="01:22:49.040" style="s2">talk to each other and they want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.239" end="01:22:52.719" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.040" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">and and it felt very different</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.719" end="01:22:56.480" style="s2">this is it felt very it was neither you</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:22:59.199" style="s2">know the revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.480" end="01:23:00.480" style="s2">of the uh of the left or the law and</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:02.239" style="s2">order of the right it was</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.480" end="01:23:05.520" style="s2">orthogonal to that it was these peoples</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.239" end="01:23:06.080" style="s2">trying to seriously time and talent and</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.520" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.080" end="01:23:12.719" style="s2">and energy and commitment to</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:14.480" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom and a deeply</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.719" end="01:23:17.760" style="s2">alternative way of being</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.480" end="01:23:19.520" style="s2">and to my mind that&#39;s where and</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.760" end="01:23:21.040" style="s2">i know you think it should be given a</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.520" end="01:23:22.560" style="s2">particular christian&#39;s plan but i</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.040" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">also think you&#39;re charitable enough to</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.560" end="01:23:26.560" style="s2">include other people of good faith who</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:29.199" style="s2">are willing to work with you</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.560" end="01:23:29.600" style="s2">i think that&#39;s where the answer uh to</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.199" end="01:23:31.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.600" end="01:23:33.280" style="s2">the more difficult problem was i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.520" end="01:23:35.120" style="s2">there is stuff actually happening</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.280" end="01:23:37.280" style="s2">right here right now culturally</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.120" end="01:23:39.520" style="s2">symbolically existentially</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.280" end="01:23:40.880" style="s2">that is where the diff the difference</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:42.159" style="s2">that is needed is starting to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.880" end="01:23:46.960" style="s2">generated</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.159" end="01:23:46.960" style="s2">ah but i i i for sure agree i think that</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.199" end="01:23:50.239" style="s2">like a way to see it is like that this</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.679" end="01:23:52.239" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.239" end="01:23:54.719" style="s2">horrible because it has bad implications</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.239" end="01:23:56.960" style="s2">but like the seeds of the next world</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.719" end="01:23:58.400" style="s2">will appear in the the current one right</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.960" end="01:24:00.719" style="s2">yes they</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.400" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">they&#39;re just hard to see you know the</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.719" end="01:24:04.080" style="s2">little sprouts are hard to see</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:05.760" style="s2">because everything else is burning in</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.080" end="01:24:06.719" style="s2">the forest right so it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.760" end="01:24:09.120" style="s2">to see the</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.719" end="01:24:10.320" style="s2">the the seeds as this is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.120" end="01:24:12.800" style="s2">breaking apart</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.320" end="01:24:14.480" style="s2">and uh and i mean i&#39;m curious to see how</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.800" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">all of this will be integrated</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.480" end="01:24:19.440" style="s2">i do i do again like you know we</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:20.480" style="s2">we we&#39;ve talked about this before right</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.440" end="01:24:21.199" style="s2">so we&#39;re not going to come to a</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.480" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.199" end="01:24:24.560" style="s2">but i do i do think that there is a need</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:27.760" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.560" end="01:24:30.960" style="s2">a a narrative cohesion and and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.760" end="01:24:32.560" style="s2">and i do think that until until</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.960" end="01:24:34.239" style="s2">something happens</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.560" end="01:24:36.159" style="s2">in the west it&#39;s still it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.239" end="01:24:38.880" style="s2">christian narrative so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.159" end="01:24:40.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t see a way out of it for at least</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.880" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t see a way out of it so</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.560" end="01:24:44.000" style="s2">but i i appreciate i do think that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:46.480" style="s2">questions that people are asking</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.000" end="01:24:47.520" style="s2">and that the desire for wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.480" end="01:24:50.719" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.520" end="01:24:52.960" style="s2">for transformation is one which</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.719" end="01:24:54.960" style="s2">will bear fruit it won&#39;t it has to if</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.960" end="01:24:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s done with sincerity and done</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.960" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">you know and a desire for transformation</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.040" end="01:25:00.239" style="s2">it will bear fruit</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">yeah and the point i&#39;m trying to make is</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.239" end="01:25:04.719" style="s2">thank you for saying that</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:06.560" style="s2">um and and you know from my part i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.719" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t ever claim to have a foreclosure</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.560" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">argument against christianity i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:11.520" style="s2">i i i always say that i do not have such</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">a fit</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.520" end="01:25:15.679" style="s2">um uh but what i was trying to emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:18.000" style="s2">is uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.679" end="01:25:19.440" style="s2">there&#39;s not only sincerity there&#39;s depth</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.000" end="01:25:22.800" style="s2">in like what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.440" end="01:25:24.000" style="s2">it has the the appreciation for humanity</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.800" end="01:25:26.080" style="s2">and complexity</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.000" end="01:25:27.199" style="s2">uh that&#39;s what i&#39;m seeing in in these</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.080" end="01:25:28.719" style="s2">people in this movement</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.199" end="01:25:30.480" style="s2">of course we&#39;re all flawed human beings</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.719" end="01:25:31.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not painting some utopic</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.480" end="01:25:34.400" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.280" end="01:25:37.440" style="s2">but i&#39;m talking about you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.400" end="01:25:39.440" style="s2">a real a real possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.440" end="01:25:41.679" style="s2">and the acknowledgement that i think it</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.440" end="01:25:43.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in existence</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.679" end="01:25:45.440" style="s2">i like your metaphor for all the ways</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.600" end="01:25:46.159" style="s2">it&#39;s fraught but i do like your metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.440" end="01:25:47.760" style="s2">of the seeds</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.159" end="01:25:48.960" style="s2">i do like putting the two together that</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.760" end="01:25:50.560" style="s2">the burning of the forest actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.960" end="01:25:51.199" style="s2">fertilizes the seeds in the way they</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.560" end="01:25:53.199" style="s2">need to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.199" end="01:25:55.360" style="s2">fertilized and perhaps you were alluding</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.199" end="01:25:57.360" style="s2">to that and your wry smile</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.360" end="01:25:59.679" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a fun it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.360" end="01:26:02.320" style="s2">not fun like it&#39;s not pleasurable</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.679" end="01:26:03.120" style="s2">no there&#39;s and it means it means death</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.320" end="01:26:05.760" style="s2">and suffering</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.120" end="01:26:06.719" style="s2">yep and i have kids and i and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.760" end="01:26:09.760" style="s2">want this</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.719" end="01:26:12.800" style="s2">but i want and what needs to happen</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.760" end="01:26:14.239" style="s2">uh are not always the same thing yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.800" end="01:26:16.239" style="s2">jonathan i think maybe this would be a</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.239" end="01:26:19.600" style="s2">good place to bring it to a close</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.239" end="01:26:20.960" style="s2">um um so um</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.600" end="01:26:22.080" style="s2">i propose to you privately and you</p>
