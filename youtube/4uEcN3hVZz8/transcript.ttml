<p begin="00:00:04.950" end="00:00:12.330" style="s2">online tree which is baby in a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.600" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">judgmental having a app and online with</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.330" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">people involved or not having other</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">people involved that walks you through</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">conflict management I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:22.680" style="s2">something I&#39;m good at but not</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:25.769" style="s2">necessarily go to Doc&#39;s key and asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.680" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">permission to do which is as a middle</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.769" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">child I&#39;m really good at pointing on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2">other side of being like oh but did you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">think that your spouse maybe meant this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">and let&#39;s look it&#39;s like you made that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">mean this negative thing but maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.940" style="s2">could be sponged mean this positive</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">thing and if I was in their boat yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.940" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">would do that too it can be helpful if</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:44.579" style="s2">someone&#39;s in the right space for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">that&#39;s why asking for permission is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.579" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">probably a good call and I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">better at that but in online conflict</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:55.260" style="s2">management apps so that like you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:57.210" style="s2">minimize the conflict in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.260" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">there could be two ways one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.210" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">if you&#39;re both involved in it like okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:02.489" style="s2">we&#39;re having a fight let&#39;s go through</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">this app and you know more spouses and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find out we&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">and a way to deal with that or not but</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">then also if it&#39;s one-sided so like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">really dislike my coworker and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">find a way to not feel seething hatred</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">every time I see them and so like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">one-sided ones with the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">not involved in actual conflict</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">management you just have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:30.229" style="s2">your internal conflict and an app that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">deals with conflict between people and</p>
