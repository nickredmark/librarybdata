<p begin="00:00:52.129" end="00:00:57.140" style="s2">fatal in the near term initially the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">plan was to create a new political party</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.140" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">the Emancipation Party overtime that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">shifted on to a different project how to</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">particularly stuck if you&#39;re unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">with the status quo then game B has to</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:25.369" style="s2">know but in 2014 the project stalled Jim</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">rut said it went into spore mode</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.369" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">recently some of these spores have</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">germinated with a new surge of interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">in game B so what can be learned from</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">what happened to the original project</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">love if you could tell the story like</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">fairly concisely but the story of game B</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">from the Emancipation Party to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">meeting that Staunton just a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">of delve down into the details of it all</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">right it goes back a little further to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">document I wrote in I got published at</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">April 2012 and I invited some people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">read it and critique it and develop some</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">momentum and resulted in a meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">Stanton Virginia in September 2012 where</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">were you know seven or eight people said</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">what are we going to do you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">world needs changing my document was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:15.270" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.670" style="s2">about a new monetary system but also</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.270" end="00:02:19.290" style="s2">included a new financial system some</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.670" end="00:02:22.320" style="s2">ideas about new political systems etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.290" end="00:02:24.210" style="s2">and we decided for better for worse to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.320" end="00:02:26.120" style="s2">start a new political party right we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.210" end="00:02:30.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t know dick about political parties</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.120" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">and we decided we&#39;d start one anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.110" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">we started having we were strong</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:36.090" style="s2">believers that face-to-face was where</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:37.830" style="s2">real stuff happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.090" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve long expressed the doctrine that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.830" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction between weak links</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">and strong links weak links is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">what you get online though sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:46.860" style="s2">get strong links from online and strong</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">links are mostly what you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.860" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">face-to-face so you can get weak links</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.500" style="s2">face-to-face too but anyway we decided</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">to meet regularly every six to eight</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.500" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">weeks to do whatever it was we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">do and they became a series of meetings</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">known as Stanton one through five and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:04.890" style="s2">the first one we decide we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:06.210" style="s2">launch a party I don&#39;t know if we came</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">up with the name at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.210" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">somewhere soon thereafter we came up</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:13.800" style="s2">with the name emancipation party we</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:15.960" style="s2">created a series of reforms and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.800" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">decided that we were going to call for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.960" end="00:03:21.390" style="s2">debt Jubilee interesting all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">at least the later version of it the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.390" end="00:03:26.550" style="s2">January 2013 version of it still up on</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:28.170" style="s2">the Emancipation Party dot-org website</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.550" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">if anybody is interested in looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.170" end="00:03:34.200" style="s2">it so anyway I think in late November</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:36.150" style="s2">early December we launched the party out</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.200" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">marketed at the people we knew and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.150" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">arrogant we were incompetent fairly</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">quickly we got a couple hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">to join and we decided to make it like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.880" style="s2">19th century European party where you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:49.860" style="s2">had to pay dues twenty dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.880" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">and what we also allow people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.860" end="00:03:55.260" style="s2">optionally select I can&#39;t afford 20 I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">pay five as part of the model to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.260" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">having to depend on fundraising and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:01.860" style="s2">money bags right and so we quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">raised a couple of got a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.860" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">people and then then in January we took</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:08.730" style="s2">stock of where we were and we said mmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:12.330" style="s2">we did pretty good with baby boomers</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.730" end="00:04:13.860" style="s2">good enough that from an early test</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.330" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">marketing perspective it would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.860" end="00:04:21.269" style="s2">proceed with Gen Xers we did not half as</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:24.260" style="s2">well as we did with boomers which from</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.269" end="00:04:27.700" style="s2">our marketing experience would have said</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.260" end="00:04:29.350" style="s2">probably improvable by fine-tuning a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.700" end="00:04:31.720" style="s2">were a period of time to make it good</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.350" end="00:04:35.830" style="s2">enough to launch and you often find you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.720" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">know version 0.8 the the early marketing</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.830" end="00:04:40.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite make sense but it&#39;s close</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.130" style="s2">enough that you believe you can tweak it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.270" end="00:04:44.740" style="s2">over a few months and he had to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.130" end="00:04:46.420" style="s2">sense millennial Millennials there</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.740" end="00:04:48.810" style="s2">weren&#39;t Z&#39;s yet Millennials were a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.420" end="00:04:51.970" style="s2">complete washout we did not get a single</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.810" end="00:04:53.910" style="s2">millennial to join not one and we went</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.970" end="00:04:57.640" style="s2">back and talked to some Millennials and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.910" end="00:05:00.610" style="s2">it was quite uniform that the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.640" end="00:05:02.700" style="s2">political party was anathema It was as</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.610" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">if you&#39;d said catch it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.700" end="00:05:07.420" style="s2">Emancipation Party catch it and even</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">though the reforms as you&#39;ll see are</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.420" end="00:05:12.700" style="s2">very progressive and millennial friendly</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:16.690" style="s2">things like what we&#39;d now call Medicare</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.700" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">for all ubi ending the drug wars you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.690" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">know radical transparency and finance a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:24.360" style="s2">whole bunch of cool new ideas you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:27.250" style="s2">think Millennials would like at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.360" end="00:05:28.810" style="s2">progressive ones the idea of calling it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.250" end="00:05:31.510" style="s2">a political party was horrible and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.810" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">asking for their subscription was also</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.510" end="00:05:34.930" style="s2">horrible they assumed it had to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">scam they couldn&#39;t figure out what scam</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.930" end="00:05:42.490" style="s2">it was they figured it had to be a scam</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:46.210" style="s2">so anyway we said shit launching a party</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.490" end="00:05:49.090" style="s2">to just appeal to Millennials to boomers</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.210" end="00:05:51.790" style="s2">not a good idea the future is young</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.090" end="00:05:53.860" style="s2">people and if this thing won&#39;t appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.790" end="00:05:55.870" style="s2">Millennials then we should not proceed</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.860" end="00:05:57.370" style="s2">so we basically stopped the limited</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:06:00.850" style="s2">marketing the test marketing we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.370" end="00:06:03.610" style="s2">doing and said let&#39;s rethink what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.850" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">doing and how to do it better and or how</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.610" end="00:06:07.960" style="s2">to restructure to respect or promote it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:11.320" style="s2">or rebrand it or something to appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.960" end="00:06:16.180" style="s2">Millennials and it was at that point in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.320" end="00:06:18.310" style="s2">a meeting Stanton 3 in January 2013 that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.180" end="00:06:20.770" style="s2">Jordan Greenhalgh at the time now known</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.310" end="00:06:23.340" style="s2">as Jordan Hall went to the whiteboard</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:28.600" style="s2">and start drawing a picture and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.340" end="00:06:32.050" style="s2">essentially he drew a fairly steep cone</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.600" end="00:06:35.200" style="s2">or pyramid or something triangle</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.050" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">probably as the Emancipation Party and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.200" end="00:06:41.430" style="s2">then he drew broad Ram</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:43.590" style="s2">leading up to it and he said what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.430" end="00:06:47.630" style="s2">really need is a softer less</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.590" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">well-defined social movement that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.630" end="00:06:52.290" style="s2">articulates some or many of the values</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.880" style="s2">of the Emancipation Party but is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.290" end="00:06:55.830" style="s2">positioned as a political party and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.880" end="00:07:00.090" style="s2">requires no contributions and requires</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.830" end="00:07:03.750" style="s2">no commitment to any action per se and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.090" end="00:07:05.400" style="s2">it will be a gradual on-ramp that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.750" end="00:07:06.990" style="s2">eventually that will particularly design</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.400" end="00:07:08.730" style="s2">to appeal to Millennials and will</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.990" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">eventually get some of them at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.730" end="00:07:16.830" style="s2">ready to join the emancipation party and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:18.480" style="s2">that what I would say was the mental</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.830" end="00:07:22.290" style="s2">model of what eventually became game</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.480" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">being that it was social movement that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.290" end="00:07:27.090" style="s2">incorporated value a set of values but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:29.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you know strictly defined and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.090" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">would appeal to young people but would</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.040" end="00:07:34.260" style="s2">gradually move them along eventually</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:37.950" style="s2">become ready for to be more politically</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.260" end="00:07:40.710" style="s2">active and then we serve that all wild</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.950" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">conversation for a goodly part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.710" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">rest of that meeting about well what</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:46.500" style="s2">would this thing be right we came up</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:47.940" style="s2">with some I believe we came up with some</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.500" end="00:07:51.270" style="s2">principles of that meeting which would</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.940" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">include that it be non hierarchical that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.270" end="00:07:56.550" style="s2">that would be a fundamental value that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">it would be network centric and that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.550" end="00:08:02.280" style="s2">that it needed to eventually lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:04.410" style="s2">social operating system that had</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">long-term metastability that it could</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.410" end="00:08:09.570" style="s2">list exists for centuries at least and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.430" end="00:08:11.640" style="s2">interestingly all three of those things</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.570" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">to this day I believe are fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.640" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">values in in neo game be thinking and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:24.750" style="s2">was quite interesting you know and very</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.020" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">rapidly became clear that the interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.750" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">of at least a majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:32.330" style="s2">participants in this activity which of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">that point is probably 25 or 30 people</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.330" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">more of them were interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:38.729" style="s2">social movement and were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:41.370" style="s2">the party but interested in the party</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.729" end="00:08:45.480" style="s2">continued you know through the rest at</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.370" end="00:08:48.150" style="s2">least until September 2013 but very</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.480" end="00:08:50.250" style="s2">clear that this concept of this vague</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.150" end="00:08:51.390" style="s2">social movement is where the energy</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.250" end="00:08:52.980" style="s2">started to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.390" end="00:08:57.210" style="s2">and it may well have been in one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.980" end="00:09:00.690" style="s2">those conversations that that at that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.210" end="00:09:03.810" style="s2">time that the concept in a generic sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.690" end="00:09:06.510" style="s2">not a branded sense is that game a is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.810" end="00:09:09.060" style="s2">the status quo and game B is this new</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.510" end="00:09:11.190" style="s2">social movement social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.060" end="00:09:13.890" style="s2">and you sort of lack of a better term</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.190" end="00:09:17.310" style="s2">essentially and that we would position</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.890" end="00:09:19.080" style="s2">game B as you know something that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.310" end="00:09:21.420" style="s2">world would eventually transition to and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.080" end="00:09:24.120" style="s2">the game B was explicitly parasitize a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">to accelerate there&#39;s certainly a fair</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.120" end="00:09:29.310" style="s2">amount of acceleration ism in that early</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:31.890" style="s2">talking and then the that meeting ended</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.310" end="00:09:33.720" style="s2">and the meetings ran from Friday evening</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.890" end="00:09:36.510" style="s2">where we started with the dinner to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.720" end="00:09:38.460" style="s2">full long intense day on Saturday and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.510" end="00:09:40.980" style="s2">then a half a day on Sunday that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.460" end="00:09:43.860" style="s2">mostly synthesis of what we had cooked</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.980" end="00:09:47.280" style="s2">on Saturday and so we went home with</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.860" end="00:09:49.080" style="s2">this new concept in the air and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.280" end="00:09:50.880" style="s2">continued to communicate as we always</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.080" end="00:09:53.910" style="s2">did on Basecamp Basecamp went all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:57.720" style="s2">way back to September 2012 and was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.910" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">main online community for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.720" end="00:10:02.280" style="s2">inner circle of the emancipation party</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.910" end="00:10:04.140" style="s2">and then what became game B and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.280" end="00:10:06.900" style="s2">shattered away as we always did you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.140" end="00:10:09.000" style="s2">I was telling David there&#39;s probably at</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.900" end="00:10:10.530" style="s2">least 10,000 posts on basically it might</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:12.660" style="s2">be a hundred thousand it&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.530" end="00:10:16.680" style="s2">we shattered away way way too much</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.660" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">probably and during this time this vague</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.680" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">idea started getting some legs on it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:26.850" style="s2">that stanton for which happened in April</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:29.550" style="s2">2013 Jordan Hall Jordan green Hall at</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.850" end="00:10:32.700" style="s2">that point now Hall made it gave a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.550" end="00:10:36.090" style="s2">presentation which don&#39;t believe he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.700" end="00:10:38.940" style="s2">still yet calling it game B but it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.090" end="00:10:41.790" style="s2">very much much more meat on the bones of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:43.740" style="s2">what we now call game B and I also had</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.790" end="00:10:46.530" style="s2">developed a lot of support and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.740" end="00:10:50.250" style="s2">etc at the same time or soon thereafter</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.530" end="00:10:54.900" style="s2">I&#39;m going to look at the timeline Thor</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.250" end="00:10:58.350" style="s2">Muller made the explicit suggestion that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.900" end="00:11:00.750" style="s2">we brand the whole effort game B earlier</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.350" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">game B had been sort of a generic</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.750" end="00:11:04.290" style="s2">comparison of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">where we&#39;re from game a to where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.290" end="00:11:08.790" style="s2">going game B but it was thought to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:12.210" style="s2">just a you know a talking point internal</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.790" end="00:11:14.430" style="s2">generic and not for brand and Thor was</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.210" end="00:11:16.950" style="s2">the one I believe who decided that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.430" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">should be branded a game be proposed</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.950" end="00:11:20.340" style="s2">that and there was some discussion as</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.790" style="s2">there always wasn&#39;t everything had to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.340" end="00:11:25.580" style="s2">with with the community and but it fixed</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.790" end="00:11:31.320" style="s2">pretty quickly that people said okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.580" end="00:11:35.010" style="s2">let&#39;s go with that and then from that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.320" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">point forward through May and June we</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.010" end="00:11:40.140" style="s2">started to ramp up the community mostly</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:41.730" style="s2">focused on game B almost all the new</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.140" end="00:11:43.860" style="s2">people that came in to the inner</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.730" end="00:11:46.200" style="s2">community were more interested in game B</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.860" end="00:11:47.900" style="s2">than they were in the emancipation party</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:50.640" style="s2">though there were still a dozen or so</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.900" end="00:11:54.750" style="s2">stalwarts including me still interested</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.640" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">principally in the party and the event</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.750" end="00:12:01.140" style="s2">and then the base camp site kept getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:04.770" style="s2">busier and busier and busier and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.140" end="00:12:06.150" style="s2">some fissures started to appear in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.770" end="00:12:08.190" style="s2">community which are saying oh if we want</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.150" end="00:12:09.720" style="s2">to talk about that separately but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.190" end="00:12:13.380" style="s2">we should so the only fissure started to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.720" end="00:12:17.210" style="s2">appear conflict different views strongly</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.380" end="00:12:20.460" style="s2">felt ugly fights and over that summer</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.210" end="00:12:24.960" style="s2">essentially the the community as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.460" end="00:12:29.520" style="s2">intense operating entity started unwind</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.960" end="00:12:33.390" style="s2">the last stanton meeting was stanton v</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.520" end="00:12:37.500" style="s2">in june of 2013 we had said there be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.390" end="00:12:40.590" style="s2">stand 6 in august it never happened you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.500" end="00:12:44.960" style="s2">know we tried some other pivots but and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.590" end="00:12:48.390" style="s2">then I I think probably in January 2014</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.960" end="00:12:50.190" style="s2">declared the thing to be done and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.390" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">think I use the words it&#39;s time for us</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.190" end="00:12:54.570" style="s2">to go into spore mode where we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.740" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">learned a lot from each other and have</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.570" end="00:12:58.830" style="s2">co-created a whole bunch of things even</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:00.690" style="s2">if we don&#39;t agree with them all agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.830" end="00:13:02.490" style="s2">with each other about everything so it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.690" end="00:13:05.190" style="s2">is now time for us to go back into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.490" end="00:13:06.900" style="s2">world live our lives do our thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.190" end="00:13:10.589" style="s2">some of this will probably continue</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.900" end="00:13:14.670" style="s2">working on game B ish things or not and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.589" end="00:13:16.149" style="s2">perhaps in the future game B will come</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.670" end="00:13:19.899" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.149" end="00:13:22.209" style="s2">and interestingly I don&#39;t know in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.899" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">last three four or five months game B</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.209" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">has come back to life very I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:28.540" style="s2">thought it was a I didn&#39;t know what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:31.329" style="s2">don&#39;t know I knew it was possible but if</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.540" end="00:13:32.769" style="s2">you&#39;d asked me in January 2014 what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.329" end="00:13:35.290" style="s2">the chances I would have said less than</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.769" end="00:13:38.589" style="s2">50/50 probably but way higher than zero</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.290" end="00:13:42.879" style="s2">and for some reason it started to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.589" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">rebuttal pretty substantially and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.879" end="00:13:47.709" style="s2">interesting a lot of it independent of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:49.509" style="s2">the original game B people over on</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.709" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">Twitter if you want to see what they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.860" end="00:15:56.440" style="s2">the shared recognition and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.810" end="00:15:59.930" style="s2">characterized everybody in the room that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.440" end="00:16:02.020" style="s2">civilization was on a dangerous track</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.930" end="00:16:06.590" style="s2">some of us believed the track to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.020" end="00:16:09.410" style="s2">fatal in the near term and the question</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.590" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">was could we figure out some alternative</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.410" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">trajectory that was not only better but</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">that was accessible from where we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:23.570" style="s2">at that time in history which would have</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:25.900" style="s2">been about 2013 and do you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.570" end="00:16:28.910" style="s2">everyone who was part of the initial</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.900" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">project recognized those sort of stakes</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.910" end="00:16:33.100" style="s2">or recognized it as that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:36.170" style="s2">civilization the important project I</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.100" end="00:16:39.170" style="s2">think the degree of recognition varied a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.170" end="00:16:41.030" style="s2">lot I think everybody recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.170" end="00:16:43.700" style="s2">there was something concerning about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.030" end="00:16:45.230" style="s2">way civilization presently runs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.700" end="00:16:47.930" style="s2">maybe everybody in the room would</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:52.100" style="s2">recognize that it was dangerous but the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.930" end="00:16:55.790" style="s2">necessity to do something was a subset</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.100" end="00:16:58.730" style="s2">of us recognized the urgency of it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.790" end="00:17:00.140" style="s2">what was achieved like in the first in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.730" end="00:17:03.080" style="s2">the first few meetings what did he feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.140" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">was achieved well I think all of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.080" end="00:17:09.170" style="s2">kinds of projects have the same initial</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:12.410" style="s2">trajectory which is you have to teach</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.170" end="00:17:14.360" style="s2">each other to speak your language to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.410" end="00:17:15.800" style="s2">things that are particularly clear from</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.360" end="00:17:20.230" style="s2">your vantage point and you have to let</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.800" end="00:17:22.910" style="s2">them do the same and if that fails then</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.230" end="00:17:25.250" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a project and if that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.910" end="00:17:27.500" style="s2">succeeds then you can begin to build on</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.250" end="00:17:32.150" style="s2">the shared understanding there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.500" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">to skip that phase and so unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.150" end="00:17:36.860" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have enough time together to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.929" style="s2">get much past it but I think we did a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.860" end="00:17:39.660" style="s2">lot of work building a shared</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.929" end="00:17:43.560" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.660" end="00:17:46.500" style="s2">and figuring out what direction that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.560" end="00:17:48.690" style="s2">would need the head and the name game be</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.500" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">is that a reference to sort of game</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.690" end="00:17:52.950" style="s2">theory and game a beings the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:54.540" style="s2">civilization we have at the moment game</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.950" end="00:17:56.850" style="s2">B being sort of placeholder for</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.540" end="00:17:59.160" style="s2">something new was was the name chosen</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.850" end="00:18:02.510" style="s2">because it represented kind of the game</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.160" end="00:18:06.570" style="s2">theoretic constraints of kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.510" end="00:18:09.180" style="s2">civilization as it is well I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.570" end="00:18:11.370" style="s2">why the name was chosen I became aware</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.180" end="00:18:13.470" style="s2">of it Jordan gave a presentation at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.370" end="00:18:15.900" style="s2">board and it roughly laid out that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.470" end="00:18:17.910" style="s2">live in something that we would loosely</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.900" end="00:18:20.370" style="s2">call game a and that we needed to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.910" end="00:18:22.500" style="s2">somewhere called game B and basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.370" end="00:18:24.630" style="s2">the idea was there was so little content</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:27.480" style="s2">in that name that it could work almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.630" end="00:18:28.800" style="s2">no matter what our priors were about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:32.490" style="s2">situation we live in and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.800" end="00:18:34.620" style="s2">we needed to do something new I do think</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.490" end="00:18:37.860" style="s2">whether it was intentionally a reference</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.620" end="00:18:39.990" style="s2">to game theory or not a an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:41.990" style="s2">figure out how civilization functions</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.990" end="00:18:45.060" style="s2">and what alternative might exist</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.990" end="00:18:48.690" style="s2">ultimately comes down to your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.060" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">take away all of the layers of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.690" end="00:18:52.770" style="s2">that we impose on our system to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:55.260" style="s2">understand how it does function which</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.770" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">would inherently be analogous to some</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.260" end="00:19:00.540" style="s2">sort of game and that a system that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:05.340" style="s2">arrived at would also inevitably even</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.540" end="00:19:09.420" style="s2">fit into the same rubric so really maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.340" end="00:19:12.210" style="s2">that name is just evidence of our shared</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.420" end="00:19:14.550" style="s2">understanding that there was a project</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.210" end="00:19:18.750" style="s2">and its basic nature would be to look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.550" end="00:19:20.730" style="s2">the rules of our current system and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.750" end="00:19:23.100" style="s2">rework them in such a way that our</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.730" end="00:19:25.560" style="s2">system would function better and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.100" end="00:19:27.030" style="s2">would you summarize that for you what at</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.560" end="00:19:29.910" style="s2">what are the failure conditions of game</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.030" end="00:19:33.150" style="s2">a versus what what does game a need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.910" end="00:19:36.450" style="s2">be well game xre what does game B need</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.150" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">to be well you know I was brought in</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.450" end="00:19:41.250" style="s2">because there was an awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:43.410" style="s2">there was something evolutionary about</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.250" end="00:19:45.930" style="s2">the whole question and that they needed</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.410" end="00:19:50.100" style="s2">someone to speak to it rather directly</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.930" end="00:19:53.170" style="s2">and the way I would phrase the problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.100" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">is this we have a tendency as humans</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.170" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2">problems and we solved them at all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.020" style="s2">of different scales whether it&#39;s little</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:02.380" style="s2">inventions that reduce the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.020" end="00:20:07.020" style="s2">work involved in some sort of objective</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:08.770" style="s2">or whether we are architecting cities or</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.020" end="00:20:11.980" style="s2">civilizations or whatever what have you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:13.900" style="s2">and the problem is that when we build</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.980" end="00:20:17.610" style="s2">these things in large measure because</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.900" end="00:20:20.200" style="s2">our history of building such things is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.610" end="00:20:24.130" style="s2">pre-darwinian we are not aware that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.200" end="00:20:27.370" style="s2">are building an entity that will evolve</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.130" end="00:20:29.680" style="s2">according to whatever niche space it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.370" end="00:20:31.930" style="s2">finds itself in and so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.680" end="00:20:33.970" style="s2">for example the American experiment the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.930" end="00:20:37.420" style="s2">American experiment was architected by</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.970" end="00:20:39.820" style="s2">highly intelligent people who understood</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.420" end="00:20:43.000" style="s2">more or less what their objectives were</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.820" end="00:20:44.740" style="s2">but they were prior to the Origin of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.000" end="00:20:47.110" style="s2">Species and so they did not recognize</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.740" end="00:20:49.150" style="s2">that in constructing this entity they</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.110" end="00:20:50.950" style="s2">were also building something that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.150" end="00:20:53.800" style="s2">morph and whatever their intentions had</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.950" end="00:20:57.430" style="s2">been at first would be inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.800" end="00:21:00.250" style="s2">swallowed by the system of incentives</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.430" end="00:21:02.170" style="s2">that surrounded the project and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.250" end="00:21:03.850" style="s2">ultimately we would find out what that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.170" end="00:21:05.290" style="s2">niche space looked like because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.850" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">entity they were building would explore</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.290" end="00:21:09.310" style="s2">it so I think we&#39;ve done this time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">time again we&#39;ve done it politically</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.310" end="00:21:12.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve done it economically where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:15.160" style="s2">set up a system we&#39;ve said what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.580" end="00:21:16.690" style="s2">wanted and then we discover over time</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.160" end="00:21:21.190" style="s2">that it turns into something we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.690" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">anticipate so my contribution to game be</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.190" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">in part was to recognize that this was</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:28.030" style="s2">an evolutionary space and it would</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:30.310" style="s2">therefore either fall victim to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.030" end="00:21:32.260" style="s2">evolutionary forces that it was unaware</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.310" end="00:21:33.670" style="s2">of or take advantage of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.260" end="00:21:35.710" style="s2">forces that it could be made aware of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.670" end="00:21:38.860" style="s2">why do you think that name particularly</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.710" end="00:21:41.470" style="s2">stuck again as I said earlier if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.860" end="00:21:44.170" style="s2">unhappy with the status quo then game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.470" end="00:21:45.790" style="s2">has to be what the status quo isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.170" end="00:21:49.300" style="s2">better the devil I don&#39;t know than the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.790" end="00:21:52.090" style="s2">devil I know and what was the need for</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.300" end="00:21:54.180" style="s2">the Emancipation Party and then game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.090" end="00:21:56.200" style="s2">how would you sort of summarize that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.180" end="00:21:57.610" style="s2">because daniel trachtenberg ER for</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.200" end="00:22:00.070" style="s2">example talks about a kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.610" end="00:22:01.450" style="s2">terminating system and do you do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.070" end="00:22:04.570" style="s2">agree with that or what would you how we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.450" end="00:22:06.860" style="s2">frame the need for the whole movement I</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.570" end="00:22:10.549" style="s2">would say the Emancipation Party</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.860" end="00:22:12.980" style="s2">was let was not that way really we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.549" end="00:22:14.360" style="s2">thought that the political and economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.980" end="00:22:16.970" style="s2">systems could collapse from their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.360" end="00:22:21.160" style="s2">internal contradictions but we were not</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.970" end="00:22:24.170" style="s2">yet focused on bigger questions about</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.160" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">that our is our social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.170" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">literally and heading for suicide I</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:33.290" style="s2">would say those conversations became</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:35.390" style="s2">part of the discussion in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.290" end="00:22:38.360" style="s2">world though probably weren&#39;t dominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.390" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">in the dominant sense well and it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.360" end="00:22:43.460" style="s2">that the world was not good not say</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:45.710" style="s2">particularly the Western world was not</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.460" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">good and in fact one of the I think more</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.710" end="00:22:50.600" style="s2">succinct statements about game B was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:52.970" style="s2">purpose of game B is to create a society</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.600" end="00:22:55.610" style="s2">we&#39;d actually like to live in and would</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.970" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">be proud to leave to our children and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.610" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">would say we did not believe that game a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:02.059" style="s2">that either of those criteria so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:05.030" style="s2">really more of it more driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.059" end="00:23:07.990" style="s2">fact that we did not think the current</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.030" end="00:23:12.040" style="s2">game a produced the best life for people</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.990" end="00:23:15.620" style="s2">yeah who came up with the name game B</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.040" end="00:23:18.860" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting question as I said</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.620" end="00:23:22.549" style="s2">earlier I actually found on Basecamp</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.860" end="00:23:27.890" style="s2">that Thor was the first to propose it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.549" end="00:23:29.960" style="s2">the branded name of the movement so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.890" end="00:23:31.610" style="s2">at one level to say that the person who</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.960" end="00:23:35.690" style="s2">said we should call what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.610" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">game B is Thor Mahler however it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.690" end="00:23:39.290" style="s2">possible if I&#39;m pretty sure it was that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:42.350" style="s2">the terms game a and game B is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.290" end="00:23:48.950" style="s2">generics to differentiate between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.350" end="00:23:50.030" style="s2">status quo and the whatever&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.030" end="00:23:53.299" style="s2">almost certainly we&#39;re floating around</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:56.030" style="s2">in fact we&#39;re certainly floating around</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.299" end="00:23:58.760" style="s2">in the conversation prior to that so who</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.030" end="00:24:02.030" style="s2">said the word game B first I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.760" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">could well have been Jordan at least one</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.030" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">person thinks it was Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:12.700" style="s2">Stein could have been Thor but not sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">but I would give Thor the nod of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.700" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">proposing it as the brand and what were</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:20.260" style="s2">the specifics that were talks about at</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.880" style="s2">the meetings what what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.260" end="00:24:24.190" style="s2">because game be as you said it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.880" end="00:24:26.170" style="s2">placeholder it it doesn&#39;t actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.190" end="00:24:28.450" style="s2">it just means an alternative to game a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.170" end="00:24:29.770" style="s2">so what were the sort of solid ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:32.620" style="s2">that were being shared at the meetings</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.770" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">that have a long long long lists of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.620" end="00:24:36.340" style="s2">which would come and they would go</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.190" style="s2">unlike the Emancipation Party was a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.340" end="00:24:41.530" style="s2">discipline that worked up to ten</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.190" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">carefully defined reforms which are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.530" end="00:24:47.980" style="s2">written about exhaustively on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:52.300" style="s2">website game B was much more amorphous</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.980" end="00:24:55.990" style="s2">and ideas came and ideas went but I said</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.300" end="00:24:59.140" style="s2">the the core three or non-hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.990" end="00:25:01.180" style="s2">was very strongly a value that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.140" end="00:25:03.610" style="s2">traditional top-down command control</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.180" end="00:25:06.700" style="s2">organizations were not about what game B</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.610" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">is in fact I would say that in neo game</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.700" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">B terms that has been resurrected in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:15.970" style="s2">stronger form which is Jordan likes to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:19.060" style="s2">say game B will not manage the complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.970" end="00:25:21.280" style="s2">via the complicated complicated meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.060" end="00:25:23.410" style="s2">things with many highly defined moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.280" end="00:25:27.130" style="s2">parts like a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.410" end="00:25:29.530" style="s2">the second was net-centric that again</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.130" end="00:25:32.680" style="s2">fits closely with non hierarchical that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.530" end="00:25:34.300" style="s2">there would be essentially fractal scale</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.680" end="00:25:36.340" style="s2">of organization and people inter</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.300" end="00:25:38.500" style="s2">communicating with each other as peers</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.340" end="00:25:40.180" style="s2">in fact this is very something something</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.500" end="00:25:42.940" style="s2">that unfortunately has not come back in</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.180" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2">Neo game B and we had the name Pierre is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.940" end="00:25:48.010" style="s2">what we called each other we were all</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:50.140" style="s2">peers kind of like comrade right so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.010" end="00:25:51.610" style="s2">were a game B Pierre if you were a</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.310" end="00:26:27.450" style="s2">was there was one sub faction that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.110" end="00:26:29.830" style="s2">believed changing yourself first was</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.450" end="00:26:32.360" style="s2">primary and then there was another</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.360" end="00:26:37.490" style="s2">creating new institutions like a better</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.140" end="00:26:46.399" style="s2">was cohousing was definitely something</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.029" end="00:26:50.779" style="s2">people were interested in as a piece</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.399" end="00:26:53.260" style="s2">part towards game B so the building the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.779" end="00:26:57.230" style="s2">piece parts and the institutions versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.260" end="00:26:59.299" style="s2">changing as a person where it was a a</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.230" end="00:27:01.580" style="s2">fission that started to become clear in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.299" end="00:27:05.000" style="s2">May and actually grew and grew and grew</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.580" end="00:27:07.010" style="s2">until it eventually was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.000" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">main fission that caused the community</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.010" end="00:27:12.169" style="s2">to kind of set upon itself in a not too</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:13.909" style="s2">pleasant way and so there were people</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.169" end="00:27:16.490" style="s2">working on the what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.909" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">change your self direction and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.490" end="00:27:20.510" style="s2">there were people thinking about these</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.620" end="00:27:22.760" style="s2">various piece parts and many of them by</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.510" end="00:27:25.809" style="s2">this point not the party anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.760" end="00:27:29.210" style="s2">again things like cohousing permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.809" end="00:27:32.419" style="s2">etc or minor monetary systems</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.210" end="00:27:34.639" style="s2">independent of a political party so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.419" end="00:27:36.169" style="s2">I understand there were five meetings at</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.639" end="00:27:37.880" style="s2">stanton and there was a six that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.169" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">planned but it never went ahead because</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.880" end="00:27:41.149" style="s2">the sense was that there wasn&#39;t enough</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.149" end="00:27:44.960" style="s2">to be there to make it worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:48.440" style="s2">what was your experience at that time</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.440" end="00:27:53.690" style="s2">some sense I don&#39;t know why we ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.539" end="00:27:56.120" style="s2">expected anything different to occur so</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.690" end="00:27:59.630" style="s2">I don&#39;t even take it as evidence that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.120" end="00:28:02.450" style="s2">did something wrong that game B came</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.630" end="00:28:04.700" style="s2">apart what I think is true is that if</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.450" end="00:28:07.909" style="s2">you are embarking on a project as</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.700" end="00:28:11.179" style="s2">ambitious as we were then you should</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.909" end="00:28:13.159" style="s2">expect to fail many many times and each</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.179" end="00:28:17.299" style="s2">of those times it is incumbent on you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.159" end="00:28:18.919" style="s2">figure out what went wrong and to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.299" end="00:28:20.149" style="s2">or eliminate the chances of that same</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.919" end="00:28:22.370" style="s2">failure happening again</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.149" end="00:28:26.419" style="s2">it&#39;s a classic question of prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.370" end="00:28:30.679" style="s2">and in this case we were prototyping two</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.419" end="00:28:32.600" style="s2">things we were trying to design a set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.679" end="00:28:34.820" style="s2">rules for civilization that might work</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.600" end="00:28:36.830" style="s2">going forward but we also needed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.820" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">design a set of rules for how we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.830" end="00:28:41.830" style="s2">interact over this question that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.940" style="s2">work and it was that second thing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.830" end="00:28:47.389" style="s2">came apart on us</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.940" end="00:28:49.669" style="s2">I was hard on the game B community after</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.389" end="00:28:52.279" style="s2">it came apart because I thought it did</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.669" end="00:28:57.309" style="s2">not do a great job in fact it really</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.279" end="00:29:00.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t do any job of analyzing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.309" end="00:29:03.500" style="s2">particular breakdown so that or their a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.679" end="00:29:05.539" style="s2">game C games he could profit from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.500" end="00:29:08.679" style="s2">knowledge of what had happened to game B</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.539" end="00:29:11.450" style="s2">and maybe we&#39;d get to you know game</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.679" end="00:29:12.889" style="s2">LMNOP who knows before we would actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.450" end="00:29:14.929" style="s2">figure out how to do it right but that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.889" end="00:29:17.899" style="s2">would be an absolutely worthy investment</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.929" end="00:29:20.210" style="s2">what happened is we left the space in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.899" end="00:29:23.269" style="s2">situation where it was as likely to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.210" end="00:29:24.919" style="s2">suffer the same failure as a new one and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.269" end="00:29:26.509" style="s2">that meant that we weren&#39;t likely to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.919" end="00:29:28.850" style="s2">make progress we were basically in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.509" end="00:29:30.860" style="s2">evolutionary terms waiting for a hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.850" end="00:29:33.110" style="s2">monster rather than learning from our</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.860" end="00:29:36.379" style="s2">mistakes so what do you think of the key</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.110" end="00:29:39.289" style="s2">lessons or the key realizations that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.379" end="00:29:43.580" style="s2">think are really important to know well</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.289" end="00:29:45.169" style="s2">I have a overarching one which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:49.190" style="s2">live for me at the moment because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.169" end="00:29:51.590" style="s2">watching the game be space come into</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.190" end="00:29:54.049" style="s2">public consciousness and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.590" end="00:29:55.970" style="s2">there is an error and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.049" end="00:29:57.470" style="s2">awareness of this although I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.970" end="00:30:00.230" style="s2">the awareness is what it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.470" end="00:30:04.639" style="s2">there is some danger of imagining that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.230" end="00:30:07.879" style="s2">game B is or could be an organization or</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.639" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">a plan for civilization going forward I</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.879" end="00:30:11.539" style="s2">don&#39;t think it can be and I think any</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:15.710" style="s2">attempt to make it either of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.539" end="00:30:18.110" style="s2">things is going to result in at best a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.710" end="00:30:21.139" style="s2">simple failure and at worst something</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.110" end="00:30:23.240" style="s2">potentially monstrous so what I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.139" end="00:30:28.190" style="s2">to see is the recognition that game B is</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.240" end="00:30:30.769" style="s2">actually fairly easy to define it is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.190" end="00:30:32.629" style="s2">virtue of it is that it is not a highly</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.769" end="00:30:35.870" style="s2">elaborate description of anything it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.629" end="00:30:39.529" style="s2">a very basic sketch of something and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.870" end="00:30:42.860" style="s2">that what that sketch ought to do is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.529" end="00:30:45.350" style="s2">ought to set in motion many projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.860" end="00:30:48.139" style="s2">once people understand what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.350" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">needs to be achieved in order to save</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.139" end="00:30:54.919" style="s2">humanity from the trajectory that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:58.639" style="s2">currently on then in principle anybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.919" end="00:31:00.710" style="s2">attempt to describe some mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.639" end="00:31:02.749" style="s2">moves in the direction of game B and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.710" end="00:31:05.210" style="s2">would point out that this doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.749" end="00:31:09.100" style="s2">to be at the scale of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.210" end="00:31:13.309" style="s2">really we have dozens of problems in</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.100" end="00:31:15.590" style="s2">society we have problems with healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.309" end="00:31:18.859" style="s2">we have problems with education we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.590" end="00:31:20.989" style="s2">problems in our courts we have problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.859" end="00:31:23.720" style="s2">with homelessness and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.989" end="00:31:28.669" style="s2">and what I would like to see in addition</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.720" end="00:31:30.769" style="s2">to a large number of groups tackle the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.669" end="00:31:32.450" style="s2">question of what a game B might look</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.769" end="00:31:34.730" style="s2">like across civilization I would also</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.450" end="00:31:38.440" style="s2">like to see people tackling the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.730" end="00:31:42.649" style="s2">of well what is the game B solution for</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.440" end="00:31:45.109" style="s2">let&#39;s say City Planning and traffic what</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.649" end="00:31:47.389" style="s2">is the game B solution for medical care</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.109" end="00:31:50.389" style="s2">all of these things each of them is ripe</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.389" end="00:31:53.179" style="s2">for its own game B solution and if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.389" end="00:31:55.249" style="s2">for example came up with game B for</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.179" end="00:31:58.850" style="s2">education which is a project I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.249" end="00:32:00.980" style="s2">actually working on with Heather that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:04.460" style="s2">that would in and of itself be a major</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.980" end="00:32:06.350" style="s2">contribution and if you solved something</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:08.299" style="s2">if you came up with game B for education</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.350" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">that obviously becomes fertile ground it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.299" end="00:32:14.649" style="s2">becomes a place to discuss the larger</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:20.149" style="s2">question of civilization so game B is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.649" end="00:32:25.179" style="s2">a set of parameters that describes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.149" end="00:32:28.340" style="s2">superior future state and it can exist</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.179" end="00:32:30.289" style="s2">at all scales in other words if you had</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.340" end="00:32:33.379" style="s2">an overarching game be it would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.289" end="00:32:36.169" style="s2">composed of lots of little game B&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.379" end="00:32:38.539" style="s2">I&#39;d like to see the space recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.169" end="00:32:40.789" style="s2">the thing to do is not to gather around</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.539" end="00:32:43.820" style="s2">game B itself and figure out you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.789" end="00:32:45.950" style="s2">who the voices of game B are the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.820" end="00:32:48.379" style="s2">to do is to recognize that game B is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.950" end="00:32:51.350" style="s2">statement about a design space and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.379" end="00:32:53.269" style="s2">for people to create initiatives that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.350" end="00:32:56.090" style="s2">function inside that design space and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.269" end="00:32:57.889" style="s2">attempt to produce either a viable</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.090" end="00:32:59.389" style="s2">something-or-other or a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.889" end="00:33:01.190" style="s2">knowledge about what doesn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.389" end="00:33:03.739" style="s2">why and you mentioned that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.190" end="00:33:05.779" style="s2">basic sketch of what the game B space</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.739" end="00:33:08.659" style="s2">needs to look like you want to sketch</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.779" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">that out for us sure well the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.659" end="00:33:15.889" style="s2">recognition about game B is that it has</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:22.340" style="s2">to be competitively superior to our</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.889" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">system and this is a difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.340" end="00:33:28.669" style="s2">swallow once you recognize that even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:30.830" style="s2">you described a wonderful future state</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.669" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">that would be terrific for people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.830" end="00:33:36.379" style="s2">you presented it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:40.309" style="s2">there is no pathway for it to find its</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.379" end="00:33:41.779" style="s2">way into the structures that make up</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.309" end="00:33:43.690" style="s2">civilization in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.779" end="00:33:46.129" style="s2">description is not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">what&#39;s worse if you turn it over to</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.129" end="00:33:50.419" style="s2">democracy and you allow us to try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:52.220" style="s2">vote it into place it will be so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.419" end="00:33:54.769" style="s2">butchered along the way by people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.220" end="00:33:56.149" style="s2">have their personal reasons to get in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.769" end="00:33:59.659" style="s2">the road that it will be unrecognizable</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.149" end="00:34:02.629" style="s2">and almost certainly again either a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.659" end="00:34:06.139" style="s2">failure or worse by the time it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.629" end="00:34:07.669" style="s2">into structural space what we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.139" end="00:34:10.970" style="s2">is you mean to look for something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.669" end="00:34:13.819" style="s2">has the characteristics of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.970" end="00:34:16.099" style="s2">smartphone right so the smartphone took</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.819" end="00:34:18.200" style="s2">over civilization not because anybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.099" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">told us you have to have a smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.200" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">but because for each of us there were</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:26.149" style="s2">reasons that we wanted it it enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:30.740" style="s2">our lives and to take two obvious</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.149" end="00:34:33.529" style="s2">examples the smartphone camera is now</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.740" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">the most popular camera on earth by</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.529" end="00:34:40.940" style="s2">orders of magnitude and it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:42.710" style="s2">making photography into a much more</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.710" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">I hesitate to even call it a hobby</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:52.579" style="s2">fraction of the time and so the ability</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.710" end="00:35:03.109" style="s2">it means that really at any moment that</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.560" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">spectacular characteristics so those</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.770" end="00:35:30.440" style="s2">sorts of things caused us all to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:33.860" style="s2">this technology now unfortunately the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.440" end="00:35:36.020" style="s2">underlying businesses that make the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.860" end="00:35:37.790" style="s2">phone and that populate it with apps</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.020" end="00:35:40.340" style="s2">those businesses are overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.790" end="00:35:42.650" style="s2">gamei entities and so unfortunately it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.340" end="00:35:46.450" style="s2">a Faustian bargain in this device that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.650" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">makes us so marvelously capable is now</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.450" end="00:35:50.330" style="s2">hell-bent on addicting us to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:52.340" style="s2">counterproductive behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.330" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">everything else so it&#39;s not as if the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.340" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">cellphone is a game B device but what it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:36:00.620" style="s2">is is a demonstration then if something</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:02.660" style="s2">empowers you enough people will embrace</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.620" end="00:36:04.310" style="s2">it without having to be told that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.660" end="00:36:08.710" style="s2">need to embrace it or without anybody</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.310" end="00:36:11.870" style="s2">being without anybody voting it into</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.710" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">into existence it just simply takes over</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.870" end="00:36:17.150" style="s2">by virtue of competitive superiority so</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:19.580" style="s2">characteristic one of game B is that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.150" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">is competitively superior so that people</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.580" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2">will embrace it not because we tell them</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:26.840" style="s2">to but because they know it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:30.580" style="s2">them to to participate something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.840" end="00:36:34.670" style="s2">that can sweep over civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.580" end="00:36:37.340" style="s2">relatively easily the second</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.670" end="00:36:38.290" style="s2">characteristic is really it comes in two</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.340" end="00:36:42.890" style="s2">forms</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.290" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">the structure has to at least be robust</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.890" end="00:36:47.600" style="s2">and maybe at first that&#39;s all it could</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:50.510" style="s2">be but ultimately the game B structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.600" end="00:36:52.850" style="s2">has to be anti fragile that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.510" end="00:36:54.770" style="s2">that challenge causes it to become</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.850" end="00:36:57.560" style="s2">stronger rather than weaker and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.770" end="00:37:03.250" style="s2">a characteristic of most evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.560" end="00:37:05.510" style="s2">systems so it has to have that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.250" end="00:37:09.860" style="s2">characteristic or it won&#39;t persist</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.510" end="00:37:11.590" style="s2">through its early phases ultimately it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.860" end="00:37:14.810" style="s2">has to be what we would call an</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.590" end="00:37:16.760" style="s2">evolutionarily stable strategy an</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.810" end="00:37:21.640" style="s2">evolutionarily stable strategy is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.760" end="00:37:23.710" style="s2">strategy that is not displace about by</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.640" end="00:37:26.390" style="s2">alternatives so in other words if some</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.710" end="00:37:28.230" style="s2">parasitic strategy or some competitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.390" end="00:37:31.080" style="s2">strategy emerges and Challen</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.230" end="00:37:33.140" style="s2">is a game be structure the game be</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.080" end="00:37:37.140" style="s2">structure has to be robust and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.140" end="00:37:38.750" style="s2">to defeat it so this is an analog of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.140" end="00:37:41.490" style="s2">competitive ability to sweep</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.750" end="00:37:44.340" style="s2">civilization and the ability to remain</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.490" end="00:37:47.630" style="s2">in place those two things go together</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.340" end="00:37:50.609" style="s2">and in the last set of characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.630" end="00:37:53.820" style="s2">have to do with what game be what</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.609" end="00:37:58.020" style="s2">achieve and I would claim that there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.820" end="00:38:03.180" style="s2">a set of values that almost any person</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.020" end="00:38:07.260" style="s2">who is not authoritarian minded would</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.180" end="00:38:12.230" style="s2">agree are highly desirable in in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.260" end="00:38:15.990" style="s2">society so things like fairness security</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.230" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">protection from catastrophic risk these</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.990" end="00:38:20.700" style="s2">sorts of things are relatively easy to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:22.290" style="s2">get people to agree to and I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.700" end="00:38:24.330" style="s2">this experiment many times I&#39;ve asked</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.290" end="00:38:26.040" style="s2">rooms full of people I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.330" end="00:38:28.290" style="s2">they feel about these things and what</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.040" end="00:38:30.750" style="s2">she discovers that we all really agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.290" end="00:38:33.600" style="s2">on the list of things that civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.750" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">should accomplish what we disagree over</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.600" end="00:38:39.690" style="s2">is an analysis of where we stand in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:44.040" style="s2">project how good our society is at for</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.690" end="00:38:48.119" style="s2">example giving people fair access to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.040" end="00:38:49.619" style="s2">market and we disagree on the priority</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.119" end="00:38:51.470" style="s2">the ordering of these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.619" end="00:38:57.510" style="s2">would dictate in other words some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.470" end="00:38:59.850" style="s2">would prioritize safety over freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:02.430" style="s2">others would prioritize freedom over</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.850" end="00:39:04.470" style="s2">safety and both of those are defensible</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.430" end="00:39:06.180" style="s2">positions so we don&#39;t necessarily expect</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.470" end="00:39:08.730" style="s2">everyone to agree on them but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.180" end="00:39:11.310" style="s2">that the list of things that society</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.730" end="00:39:13.320" style="s2">that a good society would accomplish is</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.310" end="00:39:15.600" style="s2">relatively easy to get agreement on it</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.320" end="00:39:17.550" style="s2">is very hopeful because it means we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.600" end="00:39:21.240" style="s2">paint with a broad brush what we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.550" end="00:39:23.130" style="s2">trying to accomplish with relative ease</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.240" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">and there&#39;s another thing that works in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.130" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">our favor here which is that in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:32.430" style="s2">complex system in a complex system with</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:34.109" style="s2">an objective right so there are complex</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.430" end="00:39:35.820" style="s2">systems like weather in which there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.109" end="00:39:39.050" style="s2">no objective but in a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:43.340" style="s2">with an objective like society</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.050" end="00:39:45.710" style="s2">there are automatically diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.340" end="00:39:48.230" style="s2">returns with responsive with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.710" end="00:39:51.500" style="s2">each of the objectives that can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.230" end="00:39:55.550" style="s2">labeled and what that means is that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.500" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">can achieve a large fraction of an</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.550" end="00:39:59.450" style="s2">objective but the closer you try to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.010" style="s2">to perfection with respect to it the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.450" end="00:40:03.470" style="s2">larger the costs in terms of other</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.010" end="00:40:06.140" style="s2">values so what this means is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.470" end="00:40:08.990" style="s2">can agree on the list of things that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.140" end="00:40:10.370" style="s2">game be world would achieve and we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.990" end="00:40:12.500" style="s2">agree that we don&#39;t want a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.370" end="00:40:14.930" style="s2">percent on any of them but what we want</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.500" end="00:40:17.330" style="s2">is the lion&#39;s share of all of them we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.930" end="00:40:23.120" style="s2">can have that and you know the folks who</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.330" end="00:40:25.580" style="s2">prefer safety over Liberty can probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.120" end="00:40:27.470" style="s2">have their life biased in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.580" end="00:40:29.270" style="s2">and those who prefer Liberty over safety</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.470" end="00:40:30.860" style="s2">could probably have their lives biased</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.270" end="00:40:32.570" style="s2">in the direction they prefer and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.860" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have to be an important</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.570" end="00:40:36.920" style="s2">conflict about those things because</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.680" style="s2">everybody would get the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.920" end="00:40:42.550" style="s2">everything that they were looking for</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.680" end="00:40:45.170" style="s2">and with the initial game be community</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.550" end="00:40:48.080" style="s2">what were the failure points of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.170" end="00:40:49.220" style="s2">particular organization I&#39;ve spoken to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.080" end="00:40:51.770" style="s2">few people and they&#39;ve said that there</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.220" end="00:40:55.160" style="s2">was a big split around the idea of kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.770" end="00:40:58.070" style="s2">of personal growth and systems change or</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.160" end="00:41:00.080" style="s2">institutions is that is that true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.070" end="00:41:05.840" style="s2">not what you saw play out I did see it</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.080" end="00:41:10.700" style="s2">play out I&#39;m not sure I agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.840" end="00:41:12.620" style="s2">the question is because maybe I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.700" end="00:41:17.600" style="s2">simply fall out with the systems folks</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.620" end="00:41:21.260" style="s2">but I believe that the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.600" end="00:41:23.270" style="s2">dimension is important but I believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.260" end="00:41:25.700" style="s2">that it is something it is an outgrowth</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.270" end="00:41:28.280" style="s2">of a system that is actually well enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.700" end="00:41:30.830" style="s2">architected to free you to explore that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.280" end="00:41:35.540" style="s2">and exploring it in the space of design</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.830" end="00:41:37.790" style="s2">is nonsensical it is putting the cart</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.540" end="00:41:39.530" style="s2">before the horse as it were so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.790" end="00:41:41.510" style="s2">much interested in seeing a world that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.530" end="00:41:44.090" style="s2">addresses that problem I&#39;m not so sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.510" end="00:41:45.950" style="s2">that game B discussions themselves need</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.090" end="00:41:49.190" style="s2">to address that problem and in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.950" end="00:41:50.320" style="s2">gave a talk many years ago on what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.190" end="00:41:51.840" style="s2">called the personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.320" end="00:41:53.700" style="s2">vortex</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.840" end="00:41:57.870" style="s2">and the personal responsibility vortex</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.700" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">was about the wrongheaded idea that one</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.870" end="00:42:02.460" style="s2">fixes the world through behaving in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:05.340" style="s2">personally responsible way that will</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.460" end="00:42:09.120" style="s2">then scale up and in fact the exact</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.340" end="00:42:11.310" style="s2">opposite is true if you hold people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.120" end="00:42:14.280" style="s2">live the values that they would like to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.310" end="00:42:17.520" style="s2">see fit civilization then the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.280" end="00:42:20.910" style="s2">people will be hobbled by their level of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.520" end="00:42:23.700" style="s2">obligation - for example sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.910" end="00:42:25.530" style="s2">and they will have very little impact on</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.700" end="00:42:27.060" style="s2">the way the world comes to look and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.530" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">those who pay no attention to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.060" end="00:42:31.290" style="s2">sustainability will have lots of extra</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:33.690" style="s2">resource and freedom with which to shape</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.290" end="00:42:34.740" style="s2">the world to their objective so if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.690" end="00:42:37.590" style="s2">want to see the world look a particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.740" end="00:42:40.500" style="s2">way holding people to that exact</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.590" end="00:42:42.630" style="s2">standard in the moment is seems right</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.500" end="00:42:44.450" style="s2">but the counterintuitive truth is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.630" end="00:42:47.700" style="s2">dead wrong and will be counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.450" end="00:42:51.230" style="s2">but but you did see that that split play</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.700" end="00:42:53.400" style="s2">out in terms of the direction or the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.230" end="00:42:55.350" style="s2">would you agree that that was the major</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.400" end="00:42:58.340" style="s2">split between the two different camps</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.350" end="00:43:01.980" style="s2">within game be when it split well I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.340" end="00:43:07.230" style="s2">certainly saw that conflict and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.980" end="00:43:09.270" style="s2">I would say one has to figure out how at</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.230" end="00:43:10.830" style="s2">the moment that that split emerges and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.270" end="00:43:12.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not the last time it will be seen</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.830" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">in any space that aspires to this sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.870" end="00:43:17.220" style="s2">of thing it&#39;s likely to be seen but at</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:20.670" style="s2">the point you have those two camps the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.220" end="00:43:23.310" style="s2">obvious thing to do is to divide them</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.670" end="00:43:27.530" style="s2">and say look you can&#39;t solve the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.310" end="00:43:30.300" style="s2">systemic issue by you know some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.530" end="00:43:33.330" style="s2">personal exploration it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.300" end="00:43:35.070" style="s2">invalidate personal exploration personal</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.330" end="00:43:37.020" style="s2">exploration is wonderful but if you want</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.070" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">to go do that then that&#39;s either attacks</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.020" end="00:43:44.130" style="s2">on the systems discussion right or it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:46.620" style="s2">belongs separated from it so why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.130" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">you do that and you know I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.620" end="00:43:51.000" style="s2">perfectly happy to see people who were</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:53.250" style="s2">interested in that maybe even primarily</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.000" end="00:43:55.590" style="s2">interested in that but also have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.250" end="00:43:57.630" style="s2">interest in the system&#39;s discussion to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.590" end="00:44:00.150" style="s2">come participate in a systems discussion</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.630" end="00:44:03.390" style="s2">but the systems discussion is not the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.150" end="00:44:04.420" style="s2">place for that exploration it may be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.390" end="00:44:06.519" style="s2">place to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.420" end="00:44:10.150" style="s2">how you would make civilization</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.519" end="00:44:13.569" style="s2">hospitable to such explorations but as</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.150" end="00:44:16.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve said elsewhere in order to have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.569" end="00:44:18.309" style="s2">compassionate society you have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.150" end="00:44:20.380" style="s2">dispassionate analysis of the various</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.309" end="00:44:22.630" style="s2">problems that prevent it so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:24.849" style="s2">address them and so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.630" end="00:44:27.309" style="s2">counterintuitive to people I know it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.849" end="00:44:29.890" style="s2">but when you hear people being</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.309" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">dispassionate it is not a failure of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.890" end="00:44:35.829" style="s2">their emotional structure it is a proper</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:37.660" style="s2">corralling of that structure so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.829" end="00:44:39.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get in the road of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.660" end="00:44:41.710" style="s2">system that in the long term Foster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.910" end="00:44:44.710" style="s2">exactly the thing that those who are</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.710" end="00:44:47.049" style="s2">focused on personal growth we would like</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.710" end="00:44:49.240" style="s2">to see yeah what do you think was some</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.049" end="00:44:51.700" style="s2">of the the reasons you said that it kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.240" end="00:44:52.930" style="s2">of collapsed or it fell apart can you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.700" end="00:44:54.549" style="s2">could you talk a bit more about what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.930" end="00:44:56.619" style="s2">tensions were within the community and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.549" end="00:44:58.690" style="s2">why you think that happened in my view I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.619" end="00:45:01.240" style="s2">would say this is not canonical just my</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.690" end="00:45:03.190" style="s2">view is there were two fissions that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.240" end="00:45:05.529" style="s2">are not quite entirely orthogonal with</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.190" end="00:45:07.779" style="s2">each other but are different there was</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.529" end="00:45:11.759" style="s2">let&#39;s call it the institution&#39;s or tools</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.779" end="00:45:14.529" style="s2">first faction and the change yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.759" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">faction and then there was an overlay of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.529" end="00:45:23.380" style="s2">what I&#39;d call Wu versus anti Wu Wu</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:26.859" style="s2">meaning belief in the supernatural or</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.380" end="00:45:28.779" style="s2">what I would say bullshit right and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.859" end="00:45:30.460" style="s2">were definitely a faction who especially</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.779" end="00:45:33.910" style="s2">I think they were all on the personal</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.460" end="00:45:39.369" style="s2">change side who really got into what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.910" end="00:45:41.170" style="s2">would call wound ooh a jury etc and but</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.369" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">not all the personal change people were</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.170" end="00:45:47.109" style="s2">of that sort many of them were you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">personal change in other ways but and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.109" end="00:45:52.690" style="s2">and I think the final threshold which</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:57.279" style="s2">caused the death throes were a small</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.690" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">group of people started to proclaim or</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.279" end="00:45:59.980" style="s2">at least were perceived to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:02.230" style="s2">proclaiming and this may or may not</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.980" end="00:46:03.730" style="s2">actually have happened that the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.230" end="00:46:05.740" style="s2">perception might not have been accurate</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.730" end="00:46:08.769" style="s2">or it may been so hazy it&#39;s hard to tell</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.740" end="00:46:11.250" style="s2">that some form of whoo should become</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.769" end="00:46:15.579" style="s2">mandatory and that would be utterly</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.250" end="00:46:17.890" style="s2">unacceptable to both the anti Wu and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.579" end="00:46:18.220" style="s2">institutional faction I would say of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.890" end="00:46:21.640" style="s2">ant</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.220" end="00:46:23.109" style="s2">Wars yo is number one you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.640" end="00:46:25.420" style="s2">one of my display and all that mean is</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.109" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">that some form of whoo-whoo mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.420" end="00:46:30.070" style="s2">yeah that you have to accept for</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:33.430" style="s2">instance that there&#39;s a cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.070" end="00:46:35.140" style="s2">consciousness right I go I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.430" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">in oh god damn causing the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.140" end="00:46:39.220" style="s2">to you could prove it right one of my</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.480" end="00:46:41.380" style="s2">favorite quotes that I like to use that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.220" end="00:46:43.810" style="s2">I wrote is when I hear the word</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.380" end="00:46:47.410" style="s2">metaphysics I reach for my pistol</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.810" end="00:46:48.970" style="s2">I am a hardcore scientific realist</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.410" end="00:46:50.680" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe shit unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.970" end="00:46:53.650" style="s2">evidence right on the other hand I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.680" end="00:46:55.619" style="s2">rule things out either I say yeah Nold</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.650" end="00:46:58.750" style="s2">yahweh may actually exist they get</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.619" end="00:47:01.420" style="s2">incredibly improbable but until someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.750" end="00:47:04.900" style="s2">can present evidence that yahweh exists</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.420" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">that&#39;s independently reproducible I am</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.900" end="00:47:07.840" style="s2">NOT going to believe in Yahweh right nor</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:09.310" style="s2">am I gonna believe in Cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.840" end="00:47:11.830" style="s2">Consciousness Azure and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.310" end="00:47:13.480" style="s2">worship but can you unpack what that</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.830" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">means that some people wanted that to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.480" end="00:47:19.060" style="s2">compulsory yeah what did that look like</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:21.609" style="s2">and who was that I say so again there</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.060" end="00:47:24.490" style="s2">was at least they sensed and again maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.609" end="00:47:27.490" style="s2">we overreacted that there was a small</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.490" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">number of people who were proposing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.490" end="00:47:33.210" style="s2">game be should include a metaphysical</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.210" end="00:47:36.580" style="s2">scientific realism I guess that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.830" end="00:47:37.990" style="s2">way to say it</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.580" end="00:47:40.330" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say for instance that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.990" end="00:47:43.750" style="s2">there is a cosmic consciousness so why</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.330" end="00:47:46.450" style="s2">did staunton six not happen I think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.750" end="00:47:50.320" style="s2">the decohesion of the community across</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.450" end="00:47:51.880" style="s2">all these various lines including people</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.320" end="00:47:54.430" style="s2">interested in the party still which</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.880" end="00:47:56.320" style="s2">there were still a few those interested</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.430" end="00:47:57.940" style="s2">in institution-building those interested</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.320" end="00:48:02.050" style="s2">in personal change those interested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.940" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">woo metaphysics and and people started</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.050" end="00:48:05.619" style="s2">getting mad at each other you know for</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:07.450" style="s2">promoting their point of view and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.619" end="00:48:10.359" style="s2">systemd cohered i think it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.450" end="00:48:11.859" style="s2">way to describe it and at that point I</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.359" end="00:48:13.710" style="s2">said oh yeah no point in bringing people</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.859" end="00:48:17.410" style="s2">together so we can just have a fight and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.710" end="00:48:20.500" style="s2">so it so it never happened when the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.410" end="00:48:23.050" style="s2">initial sort of Stenton meeting stops I</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.500" end="00:48:25.030" style="s2">know Jim said that that it was basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.050" end="00:48:26.710" style="s2">going to spore mode that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.030" end="00:48:30.779" style="s2">original people went off and did their</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.779" end="00:48:34.199" style="s2">spores or at least the kind of the meme</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.549" end="00:48:35.999" style="s2">of game beers now getting a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.199" end="00:48:37.829" style="s2">attention there&#39;s like Facebook grooves</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.999" end="00:48:40.589" style="s2">it&#39;s got some presence on Twitter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.829" end="00:48:44.159" style="s2">sort of growing up one did has that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.589" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">surprised you at all and to actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.159" end="00:48:47.939" style="s2">just one is that Supriya make of the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.079" end="00:48:51.089" style="s2">the kind of the resurgence of interest</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.939" end="00:48:53.069" style="s2">in this area well I see it as a result</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.089" end="00:48:57.239" style="s2">of a couple of different things and one</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.069" end="00:49:00.869" style="s2">of them I had some involvement and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.239" end="00:49:03.479" style="s2">mentioned game B at some length on Joe</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.869" end="00:49:04.919" style="s2">Rogan&#39;s podcast and I know that there</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.479" end="00:49:06.749" style="s2">was a flurry of interest that came from</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.919" end="00:49:09.059" style="s2">that so in one way it can&#39;t surprise me</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.749" end="00:49:11.369" style="s2">too much because I was sort of hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.059" end="00:49:15.209" style="s2">see it and went about talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.369" end="00:49:17.339" style="s2">publicly now even at the point that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.209" end="00:49:18.989" style="s2">was talking about it on Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.339" end="00:49:23.519" style="s2">program there was already a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.989" end="00:49:25.319" style="s2">organic I think slower growing movement</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.319" end="00:49:29.339" style="s2">I have been reluctant about</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.150" end="00:49:34.109" style="s2">participating in it for various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.339" end="00:49:36.419" style="s2">but nonetheless I&#39;m not surprised that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.109" end="00:49:42.919" style="s2">something has emerged I&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.419" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">startled by the way I hear game be</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.919" end="00:49:49.140" style="s2">discussed and I feel like the energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:52.979" style="s2">that one of the things that worked in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.140" end="00:49:56.219" style="s2">our favor in the game be discussion was</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.979" end="00:49:59.069" style="s2">the fact that we were nobody to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.219" end="00:50:00.390" style="s2">right this was an invisible discussion</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.069" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">and because it was an invisible</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.390" end="00:50:06.900" style="s2">discussion we had the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:10.309" style="s2">explore down different avenues without</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.900" end="00:50:12.929" style="s2">worrying so much about what it meant and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.309" end="00:50:15.749" style="s2">now that there is sort of a public</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.929" end="00:50:18.089" style="s2">awareness in certain circles about game</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.749" end="00:50:22.229" style="s2">B and Stanton and all of these things I</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.089" end="00:50:26.249" style="s2">think there&#39;s a tremendous danger of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.229" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">idea being you know captured would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.249" end="00:50:33.900" style="s2">the worst way it could fail the more</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:36.630" style="s2">likely way is it could evolve in some</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.900" end="00:50:39.479" style="s2">direction that is counterproductive you</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:44.729" style="s2">must talk a bit more violence it is very</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.479" end="00:50:49.019" style="s2">difficult to distinguish between people</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.729" end="00:50:50.999" style="s2">who earnestly believe something and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.019" end="00:50:53.729" style="s2">espouse it because of their earnest</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.999" end="00:50:56.189" style="s2">belief and people who discover that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.729" end="00:51:02.459" style="s2">espousing that belief puts them ahead</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.189" end="00:51:08.219" style="s2">and it is 100% inevitable that people</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.459" end="00:51:12.630" style="s2">who see the game be discussion as an</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.219" end="00:51:15.269" style="s2">opportunity will find their way there</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.630" end="00:51:19.079" style="s2">and will say the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.269" end="00:51:23.789" style="s2">get people to not along and that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.079" end="00:51:30.479" style="s2">thing that momentum can take a movement</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.789" end="00:51:33.329" style="s2">that is highly generative and can swamp</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.479" end="00:51:34.679" style="s2">it with something else and I really</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.329" end="00:51:35.909" style="s2">don&#39;t have any interest in participating</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.679" end="00:51:38.939" style="s2">into something else</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.909" end="00:51:40.949" style="s2">the question is we actually faced this</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.939" end="00:51:43.609" style="s2">question at the end of the Stanton</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.949" end="00:51:46.469" style="s2">meetings which was there was a desire to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.609" end="00:51:48.449" style="s2">increase the size of the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.469" end="00:51:52.439" style="s2">which I think everybody agreed was a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.449" end="00:51:55.199" style="s2">good idea but there was this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.439" end="00:51:59.579" style="s2">rush to bring people in and I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.199" end="00:52:03.779" style="s2">caution at the time that a single error</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.579" end="00:52:05.909" style="s2">is very costly so you may bring in ten</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.779" end="00:52:08.819" style="s2">generative people there may be</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.909" end="00:52:11.519" style="s2">diminishing returns on your generative</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.819" end="00:52:13.169" style="s2">people in other words a lot of what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.519" end="00:52:17.400" style="s2">bring to the table may already be in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.169" end="00:52:22.109" style="s2">room but one mistake right one bad actor</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.400" end="00:52:24.869" style="s2">or one person who is motivated by what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.109" end="00:52:28.709" style="s2">would call social truth rather than an</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.869" end="00:52:32.219" style="s2">analytical truth can cause tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.709" end="00:52:35.759" style="s2">havoc and so I thought we were making an</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.219" end="00:52:37.739" style="s2">error in a couple of different ways one</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.759" end="00:52:40.469" style="s2">I thought that the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.739" end="00:52:43.189" style="s2">organization moved from being the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.469" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">Emancipation party into being game be</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.189" end="00:52:49.079" style="s2">that turned out to be an error pretty</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:51.869" style="s2">clearly game B is not an organization it</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.079" end="00:52:54.320" style="s2">should never be an organization and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.869" end="00:52:56.270" style="s2">Emancipation Party rightly was it made</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.320" end="00:52:58.130" style="s2">this one so there should have been a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.270" end="00:53:02.330" style="s2">relationship between those two things</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.130" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">and what I&#39;m getting at is instead of</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.330" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">doing what we did which was decided that</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:11.150" style="s2">the Emancipation Party was a non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:13.850" style="s2">I think 2016 election in the US and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.150" end="00:53:16.580" style="s2">you saw in Britain with brexit in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.850" end="00:53:19.370" style="s2">tells us that actually there was room</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.580" end="00:53:21.770" style="s2">for some sort of an alternative party</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.370" end="00:53:26.990" style="s2">and if the Emancipation Party had stuck</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.770" end="00:53:30.620" style="s2">it out from 2013 who knows what might</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.990" end="00:53:32.510" style="s2">have happened but the Emancipation party</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.620" end="00:53:34.310" style="s2">at the point that we decided it was not</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.510" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">the right moment in history for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.310" end="00:53:40.250" style="s2">Emancipation Party should have become a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:42.170" style="s2">sub-project of whatever the organization</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.250" end="00:53:45.770" style="s2">was functioning towards a game be</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.170" end="00:53:47.960" style="s2">objective that&#39;s not what we did we</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.770" end="00:53:51.830" style="s2">decided the Emancipation Party was no</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.960" end="00:53:57.590" style="s2">more we decided that this was game B</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.830" end="00:54:01.850" style="s2">which was an error and then we decided</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.590" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">to increase who was in the room which</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.850" end="00:54:05.390" style="s2">took whatever tensions were already</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:08.210" style="s2">there be they tensions between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.390" end="00:54:11.420" style="s2">spiritual and the systemic or or</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.210" end="00:54:15.140" style="s2">whatever and it made them worse</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.420" end="00:54:19.420" style="s2">so one thing I would advise anybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.140" end="00:54:23.000" style="s2">attempting to build a game be entity is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.420" end="00:54:26.210" style="s2">to figure out how to insulate things</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.000" end="00:54:30.290" style="s2">that are functional from things whose</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.210" end="00:54:34.550" style="s2">impact you don&#39;t yet know so in other</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.290" end="00:54:38.090" style="s2">words some capacity to go in reverse or</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.550" end="00:54:41.630" style="s2">to change direction or some isolate that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.090" end="00:54:43.340" style="s2">can be preserved if your decision that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.630" end="00:54:47.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve just made turns out to have been</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.340" end="00:54:52.190" style="s2">a mistake and we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.570" end="00:54:54.890" style="s2">that we we just simply decided the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.190" end="00:54:57.830" style="s2">organization should grow and that would</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.890" end="00:55:00.530" style="s2">have been fatal if nothing else was and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.830" end="00:55:02.780" style="s2">you mentioned coherence as one lesson</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.530" end="00:55:04.010" style="s2">that maybe can be learned from it but do</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.780" end="00:55:06.020" style="s2">you think the other lessons are</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.010" end="00:55:07.700" style="s2">especially now that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.020" end="00:55:08.060" style="s2">resurgence of interest in the whole game</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.700" end="00:55:10.190" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.060" end="00:55:12.380" style="s2">space well well what should people take</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.190" end="00:55:14.680" style="s2">on board coherence for sure and second</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.380" end="00:55:21.230" style="s2">and this would be perhaps controversial</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.680" end="00:55:24.410" style="s2">is that institutions do matter and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.230" end="00:55:28.070" style="s2">neo game be once it decides to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.410" end="00:55:31.910" style="s2">beyond being a talk shop should build</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.070" end="00:55:34.250" style="s2">some early institutions on how to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.910" end="00:55:36.110" style="s2">things you know a justice system which</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.250" end="00:55:39.700" style="s2">we eventually did build and late game be</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.110" end="00:55:41.930" style="s2">called the ad hoc justice process and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.700" end="00:55:43.700" style="s2">then when there was a call to build a</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.930" end="00:55:48.080" style="s2">formal justice process never got done</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.700" end="00:55:52.190" style="s2">but some preliminary institutions but</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.080" end="00:55:53.780" style="s2">that are known to be contingent and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.190" end="00:55:55.250" style="s2">they&#39;re not well formed yet and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.780" end="00:55:56.930" style="s2">they were subject to amendment so it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.250" end="00:55:59.480" style="s2">needs to have an amendment meta process</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.930" end="00:56:02.780" style="s2">so I would strongly suggest at some</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.480" end="00:56:04.700" style="s2">point that a line be drawn at least a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.780" end="00:56:09.590" style="s2">minimal set of bootstrap institutions</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.700" end="00:56:15.230" style="s2">come into existence second third that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.590" end="00:56:18.530" style="s2">the onboarding process be more rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.230" end="00:56:22.790" style="s2">or at least you know the fairly rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.530" end="00:56:25.610" style="s2">in game B but that it be tuned for</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.790" end="00:56:28.010" style="s2">coherence rather than X too much</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.610" end="00:56:30.200" style="s2">exploration or I title I&#39;ll take that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.010" end="00:56:33.560" style="s2">back a balance between coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.200" end="00:56:35.330" style="s2">exploration the game be late-game be was</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.560" end="00:56:38.150" style="s2">too much exploration not enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.330" end="00:56:40.970" style="s2">coherence mmm and you also said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.150" end="00:56:43.820" style="s2">on the there&#39;s a danger incoherence yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.970" end="00:56:47.770" style="s2">I mean what is ultimate coherence a cult</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.820" end="00:56:50.930" style="s2">right or a dictatorship so I see that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.770" end="00:56:53.210" style="s2">coherence is hugely important but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.930" end="00:56:56.390" style="s2">would say absolute coherence ie lack of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.210" end="00:56:58.370" style="s2">coherent pluralism is even worse than no</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.390" end="00:57:00.410" style="s2">coherence or yeah like you can argue</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.370" end="00:57:02.570" style="s2">whether North Korea is worse than</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.410" end="00:57:04.610" style="s2">Anarchy I don&#39;t know they both suck</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.570" end="00:57:08.360" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that you know North</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.610" end="00:57:10.550" style="s2">Korea extreme coherence pure anarchy no</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.360" end="00:57:13.430" style="s2">coherence and so what you want to be is</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.550" end="00:57:15.890" style="s2">somewhere in the middle with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.430" end="00:57:17.720" style="s2">thoughtful nuanced balance of where you</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.890" end="00:57:19.610" style="s2">are and what makes ya make it this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.720" end="00:57:20.790" style="s2">the coherent core we all agree we</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.610" end="00:57:23.640" style="s2">believe this</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.790" end="00:57:25.710" style="s2">or if we don&#39;t were not part and an</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.640" end="00:57:29.400" style="s2">explicit statement that anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.710" end="00:57:30.390" style="s2">not in the core is pluralistic until</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.400" end="00:57:32.850" style="s2">they&#39;re filled through some</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.390" end="00:57:34.530" style="s2">institutional process we may find some</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.530" end="00:57:37.710" style="s2">also through an institutional process</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.970" end="00:57:41.600" style="s2">made once to take some things out of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.710" end="00:57:45.060" style="s2">core spore mode spore mode refers to</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.600" end="00:57:47.640" style="s2">mushrooms you know the the real mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.060" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">lives underground or in rotten wood etc</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.640" end="00:57:51.960" style="s2">then the so called fruiting body is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:55.320" style="s2">thing that we see and that we eat and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.960" end="00:57:57.150" style="s2">typically it grows up and then it fruits</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.320" end="00:57:59.850" style="s2">which are typically spores which are</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.150" end="00:58:02.130" style="s2">tiny tiny tiny little seeds which often</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.850" end="00:58:04.680" style="s2">get blown by the wind a long way and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.130" end="00:58:06.150" style="s2">mushroom spores can often exist for many</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.680" end="00:58:08.280" style="s2">many years if the conditions are right</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.150" end="00:58:09.960" style="s2">before they sprout and when the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.280" end="00:58:13.500" style="s2">conditions are right then they sprout</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.960" end="00:58:15.300" style="s2">and a new mushroom grows so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.500" end="00:58:18.090" style="s2">model I decided to use sort of at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.300" end="00:58:20.190" style="s2">end of active game B they were going</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.090" end="00:58:22.440" style="s2">into sport mode everyone is gonna do are</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.190" end="00:58:25.230" style="s2">gonna disperse our spores ie our people</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.440" end="00:58:27.450" style="s2">out into the world and they&#39;ll continue</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.230" end="00:58:29.250" style="s2">to do whatever it is they do and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.450" end="00:58:31.800" style="s2">in a different time in a different</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.250" end="00:58:33.420" style="s2">climate and as the world&#39;s changed this</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.800" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">things have been learned some of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.420" end="00:58:40.440" style="s2">spores will take root again and grow new</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:41.910" style="s2">mushrooms and so in the last few months</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.440" end="00:58:44.010" style="s2">that seems to be happening you want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.910" end="00:58:45.990" style="s2">tell us what&#39;s going on now truthfully I</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.010" end="00:58:50.250" style="s2">can&#39;t tell you for sure but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.990" end="00:58:54.180" style="s2">noticed a tremendous upsurge in interest</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.250" end="00:58:55.950" style="s2">in game B in I guess we don&#39;t were here</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.180" end="00:58:58.740" style="s2">in October so it was certainly happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.950" end="00:59:02.280" style="s2">in July June July I haven&#39;t truthfully</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.740" end="00:59:03.960" style="s2">tracked back the traffic I think some of</p>

<p begin="00:59:14.520" end="00:59:20.520" style="s2">helped but something happened in that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.500" end="00:59:22.770" style="s2">June July timeframe and game B seems to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.520" end="00:59:23.940" style="s2">be you know spreading and groups of</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.320" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">days ago and I said we didn&#39;t know any</p>

<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:41.290" style="s2">somehow you know come upon all of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.660" end="00:59:44.350" style="s2">various works and went and been actively</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.290" end="00:59:46.180" style="s2">working them and have created these very</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.350" end="00:59:48.010" style="s2">interesting online Google Docs which</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.180" end="00:59:51.850" style="s2">point to all kinds of references and</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.470" end="00:59:58.540" style="s2">very game be ish right non hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.260" end="01:00:00.430" style="s2">Network centric and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.540" end="01:00:03.850" style="s2">metastable din last a long time will say</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.430" end="01:00:06.190" style="s2">so there&#39;s a community on Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.850" end="01:00:07.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a community a community with</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.990" end="01:00:12.520" style="s2">way to find them and there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.030" end="01:00:16.090" style="s2">rapidly growing community on Facebook in</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.520" end="01:00:18.190" style="s2">the Facebook group game be and make sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.090" end="01:00:19.810" style="s2">you answer the three questions dammit if</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.190" end="01:00:21.340" style="s2">you apply for membership because you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.810" end="01:00:23.260" style="s2">will not be lied in if you don&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.340" end="01:00:25.210" style="s2">the three questions and what do you make</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.260" end="01:00:26.859" style="s2">of the this current upsurge did it take</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.210" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">you by surprise or what what what are</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.859" end="01:00:29.890" style="s2">you saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:32.260" style="s2">what do you think it well how did it</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.890" end="01:00:34.420" style="s2">look to you ah it&#39;s a very excellent</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.260" end="01:00:38.290" style="s2">question out surprise about any given</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.420" end="01:00:39.550" style="s2">time yes right because you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.290" end="01:00:41.800" style="s2">the things we learn from a complexity</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.550" end="01:00:43.210" style="s2">systems perspective is the trajectory of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.800" end="01:00:46.359" style="s2">a complex system is exceedingly</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.210" end="01:00:48.690" style="s2">difficult to predict however you may be</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.359" end="01:00:53.800" style="s2">able to predict some averages across</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.690" end="01:00:55.720" style="s2">ensembles of subject Ares and so when we</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.800" end="01:00:58.450" style="s2">put game B into spore mode I might have</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.720" end="01:01:00.130" style="s2">said there was a 50% chance he to come</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.450" end="01:01:03.670" style="s2">back to life someday</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.130" end="01:01:04.990" style="s2">right but when I had no clue and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.670" end="01:01:06.970" style="s2">fact that it seems have come back to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.990" end="01:01:08.650" style="s2">life this summer I would not have</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.970" end="01:01:11.260" style="s2">predicted in advance and that&#39;s typical</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.650" end="01:01:12.820" style="s2">complex system story phase transitions</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.260" end="01:01:14.830" style="s2">as we call them are typically</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.820" end="01:01:17.890" style="s2">unpredictable and so a phase transition</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.830" end="01:01:20.350" style="s2">seems to have occurred and it&#39;s now self</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.890" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">generating and probably growing with an</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.350" end="01:01:24.790" style="s2">exponential with some exponent greater</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:26.710" style="s2">than one which means if you wait long</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.790" end="01:01:28.600" style="s2">enough it&#39;ll conquer the whole world but</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.710" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">what how long that exponent will remain</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.600" end="01:01:32.890" style="s2">greater than one I don&#39;t know but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:35.050" style="s2">actually quite interesting and in fact I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.890" end="01:01:39.310" style="s2">like it about it is that it is very game</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.050" end="01:01:42.420" style="s2">B it&#39;s bottoms up nobody dictating what</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.310" end="01:01:45.250" style="s2">game B is people kind of collectively</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.420" end="01:01:46.930" style="s2">creating it no as I said earlier I do</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.250" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">believe at some point they need to build</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.930" end="01:01:49.930" style="s2">some institutional</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:52.390" style="s2">structures in there to keep the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.930" end="01:01:54.970" style="s2">of the previous problem of decoherence</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.390" end="01:01:56.829" style="s2">from occurring hmm and I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.970" end="01:01:59.770" style="s2">mentioned the names Jordan and Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.829" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">and so a lot of the energy at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.770" end="01:02:05.319" style="s2">is around that particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:07.089" style="s2">conception of game B what do you make of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.319" end="01:02:09.579" style="s2">that yeah I think this fair to say that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.089" end="01:02:14.020" style="s2">the most actual work that has been done</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.579" end="01:02:16.630" style="s2">on game B since 2014 has been done by</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.020" end="01:02:19.559" style="s2">what I call the San Diego configuration</p>

<p begin="01:02:55.299" end="01:03:01.240" style="s2">economics might look like Jordans done a</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.250" end="01:03:10.869" style="s2">a really good body of work however</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.710" end="01:03:12.789" style="s2">they&#39;ll be the first to admit they have</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.869" end="01:03:15.250" style="s2">done nothing like the definitive answer</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.789" end="01:03:18.450" style="s2">what is game B they&#39;ve essentially put</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.250" end="01:03:21.069" style="s2">out a series of piece parts and partial</p>

<p begin="01:03:40.599" end="01:03:46.470" style="s2">keep it somewhat private for now</p>

<p begin="01:04:20.849" end="01:04:24.930" style="s2">of it was wrong to my mind at least</p>

<p begin="01:04:53.820" end="01:05:00.570" style="s2">is that you need to develop a deep</p>

<p begin="01:05:00.570" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">prototyping that prototyping is the way</p>

<p begin="01:05:16.650" end="01:05:24.270" style="s2">attention to prototyping so if we look</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.859" end="01:05:25.530" style="s2">at the United States as a project we</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.270" end="01:05:28.140" style="s2">might come to the conclusion that it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.530" end="01:05:31.320" style="s2">a failed project if we look at it as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.140" end="01:05:33.750" style="s2">prototype then we can say well this was</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.320" end="01:05:36.960" style="s2">actually a wildly successful prototype</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.750" end="01:05:39.390" style="s2">that eventually showed what about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:42.930" style="s2">design wasn&#39;t quite right it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.390" end="01:05:46.170" style="s2">definitely time for a 2.0 version of</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.930" end="01:05:47.490" style="s2">something what&#39;s more it has to be a 2.0</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.170" end="01:05:51.510" style="s2">version of something that does not</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.490" end="01:05:54.060" style="s2">require the collapse of what is somehow</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.510" end="01:05:56.940" style="s2">we have to seamlessly move</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.060" end="01:06:01.950" style="s2">from our prototype to something that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.940" end="01:06:04.230" style="s2">more capable and stable without this one</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.950" end="01:06:06.780" style="s2">coming apart that&#39;s why I make this</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.230" end="01:06:08.820" style="s2">point about competitive superiority and</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.780" end="01:06:11.730" style="s2">sweeping across civilization without</p>

<p begin="01:06:17.340" end="01:06:24.450" style="s2">I guess one final point I would make is</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.590" end="01:06:27.360" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a tension that I have</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.450" end="01:06:30.090" style="s2">it&#39;s been described in many places but I</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.360" end="01:06:33.690" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it described with full</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.090" end="01:06:37.430" style="s2">breadth anywhere which is that those</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.690" end="01:06:42.270" style="s2">things which are the most capable are</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.430" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">always fragile ok to the extent that we</p>

<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:50.580" style="s2">reach greater heights those</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.880" end="01:06:52.560" style="s2">conversations are absolutely vulnerable</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.560" end="01:06:56.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want them to happen right so</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.240" end="01:06:59.040" style="s2">high capacity and vulnerability go</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.430" end="01:07:00.660" style="s2">together in a way that&#39;s not how we</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.040" end="01:07:02.220" style="s2">imagined it typically we think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.660" end="01:07:04.580" style="s2">something that is highly capable is also</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.220" end="01:07:07.740" style="s2">very strong rather than very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.580" end="01:07:11.190" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is a discussion</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.740" end="01:07:13.260" style="s2">in which we are able to see what might</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.190" end="01:07:16.410" style="s2">be possible for civilization and how it</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.260" end="01:07:19.740" style="s2">might be architected to be anti fragile</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.410" end="01:07:23.370" style="s2">and evolutionarily stable in the end but</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.740" end="01:07:26.580" style="s2">that discussion itself will be fragile</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.370" end="01:07:28.560" style="s2">it has to be protected and protected</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.569" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">we could also maybe see as a prototype</p>

<p begin="01:08:21.839" end="01:08:26.429" style="s2">this that I wanted to raise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.489" end="01:08:28.259" style="s2">something the references are something</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.429" end="01:08:29.640" style="s2">that you and Eric talked about in the</p>

<p begin="01:08:29.640" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">truth cannot survive the encounter with</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.250" end="01:08:36.929" style="s2">market forces which I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:38.900" style="s2">really valuable frame to look at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.929" end="01:08:41.580" style="s2">sort of game a game B conversation</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.900" end="01:08:43.770" style="s2">especially because I saw him one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.580" end="01:08:45.390" style="s2">in the game B Facebook group someone</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.770" end="01:08:46.920" style="s2">said well what is what is game B</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.390" end="01:08:49.080" style="s2">journalism and I thought about that for</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.920" end="01:08:51.770" style="s2">a while like that&#39;s my area of interest</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.080" end="01:08:55.500" style="s2">interesting I thought well at its best</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.770" end="01:08:59.100" style="s2">journalism is game B in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.500" end="01:09:02.100" style="s2">that academia is game B and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.100" end="01:09:05.219" style="s2">realize that it&#39;s like that they have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.100" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">be like game B journalism should be</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.219" end="01:09:10.339" style="s2">about pew like true truly ethical</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">information so if you have any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.339" end="01:09:13.259" style="s2">allegation you&#39;ve got to put it to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:14.549" style="s2">person get their response you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.259" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">supposed to get all the views of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.549" end="01:09:19.710" style="s2">everyone before doing your story so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:22.009" style="s2">so that as a case study journalism and</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.710" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">academia why are they failing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.009" end="01:09:27.420" style="s2">probably as good a way as any to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:28.759" style="s2">look at okay what are what are the what</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.420" end="01:09:31.560" style="s2">are the factors that are making game</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.759" end="01:09:33.179" style="s2">well a game suppose a game B enterprise</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.560" end="01:09:35.790" style="s2">what are the game a factors that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.179" end="01:09:37.980" style="s2">making them fail so I think another way</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.790" end="01:09:42.929" style="s2">to look at this is that there are many</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.980" end="01:09:46.549" style="s2">things that exist where we increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.929" end="01:09:49.679" style="s2">only know they&#39;re pathological form and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.549" end="01:09:51.659" style="s2">it is the conflation of the pathological</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.679" end="01:09:53.489" style="s2">form with the form itself that is so</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.659" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">confusing so the fact that there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.489" end="01:09:58.949" style="s2">almost no game B journalism means that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:06.830" style="s2">we understand journal journalism to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.949" end="01:10:10.500" style="s2">this malformed arbitrary on truthful</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.830" end="01:10:10.920" style="s2">dispenser of information but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.500" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.920" end="01:10:15.719" style="s2">journalism itself would be a game B</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:17.909" style="s2">enterprise right you report what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.719" end="01:10:19.090" style="s2">in spite of its implications for you</p>

<p begin="01:11:21.400" end="01:11:25.599" style="s2">to bring us to such a world we will</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.949" end="01:11:28.409" style="s2">discover that many of the forms that</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.599" end="01:11:30.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen distorted are really</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.409" end="01:11:33.880" style="s2">permutations of something honorable that</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.610" end="01:11:36.489" style="s2">has been lost so one of my concerns</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.880" end="01:11:41.139" style="s2">about the way the game be conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.489" end="01:11:43.270" style="s2">is unfolding is that it is collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.139" end="01:11:47.739" style="s2">all of the conversations that might</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.270" end="01:11:50.349" style="s2">ultimately produce their own prototype</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.739" end="01:11:53.949" style="s2">into one conversation and I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.349" end="01:11:56.170" style="s2">any way that that can end well we talked</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.949" end="01:11:59.260" style="s2">about this a little bit during the stand</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.170" end="01:12:03.130" style="s2">meetings I raised the question about</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.260" end="01:12:05.619" style="s2">whether or not we were the only</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.130" end="01:12:07.810" style="s2">discussion of this kind or whether there</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.619" end="01:12:10.510" style="s2">were a hundred such rooms or a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.810" end="01:12:11.679" style="s2">and it was clear to me and I think many</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.510" end="01:12:14.440" style="s2">others that it would have been wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.679" end="01:12:16.869" style="s2">had there been many such discussions</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.440" end="01:12:19.810" style="s2">because only one of them has to work the</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.869" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">point of a game B is not for us to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.810" end="01:12:23.320" style="s2">produce a world that will work it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:26.380" style="s2">somebody to accomplish it and in some</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.320" end="01:12:28.060" style="s2">ways best possible outcome for any</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.380" end="01:12:29.440" style="s2">individual is for somebody else to</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.060" end="01:12:32.170" style="s2">figure out how to get us there because</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:32.619" style="s2">it really takes the pressure off and it</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.170" end="01:12:35.050" style="s2">means you</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.619" end="01:12:41.260" style="s2">to have the advantages of that wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.050" end="01:12:43.420" style="s2">world on the far side but I think one of</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.260" end="01:12:46.030" style="s2">the things that we have learned in that</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.420" end="01:12:49.900" style="s2">discussion and then us all fanning out</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.030" end="01:12:51.820" style="s2">from it is that there aren&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.900" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">such conversations and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.820" end="01:12:55.659" style="s2">actually probably a reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:57.610" style="s2">which is that the way we are connected</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.659" end="01:12:59.619" style="s2">together today there is a strong</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.610" end="01:13:01.659" style="s2">tendency for people who are like-minded</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.619" end="01:13:04.000" style="s2">enough to have thought their way down</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.659" end="01:13:07.570" style="s2">that road to some degree to coalesce</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.000" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">into one discussion and that tendency to</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.570" end="01:13:14.080" style="s2">coalesce into one discussion means that</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:16.119" style="s2">the chances of multiple variations on</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:18.310" style="s2">that theme resulting in one of them</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.119" end="01:13:22.630" style="s2">surviving and beating the odds is</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.310" end="01:13:24.310" style="s2">greatly reduced so I am a little</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.630" end="01:13:27.119" style="s2">concerned you know there are lots of</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.310" end="01:13:31.889" style="s2">people who are now in this game B space</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.119" end="01:13:31.889" style="s2">who are not at the Stanton meetings and</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.400" end="01:13:38.920" style="s2">what concerns me is I mean people like</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.650" end="01:13:41.949" style="s2">Jamie Weil and Daniel Martin burger is</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.920" end="01:13:44.830" style="s2">that instead of us all being in one</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.949" end="01:13:47.530" style="s2">conversation wouldn&#39;t we be better off</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.830" end="01:13:49.090" style="s2">if those were separate nodes and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.530" end="01:13:50.739" style="s2">not saying what we shouldn&#39;t be talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.090" end="01:13:52.659" style="s2">to each other but the idea that it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.739" end="01:13:55.659" style="s2">all one discussion looking for one</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.659" end="01:13:59.290" style="s2">solution just reduces the odds of</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.659" end="01:14:02.139" style="s2">success all the more isn&#39;t there a</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.290" end="01:14:03.760" style="s2">paradox then in that the more we talk</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.139" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">about it the more it becomes one</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.760" end="01:14:08.380" style="s2">discussion so isn&#39;t talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:13.270" style="s2">kind of feeding that trend towards it</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.380" end="01:14:17.139" style="s2">being one one conversation you know Eric</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.270" end="01:14:19.420" style="s2">and I and Heather and I have a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.139" end="01:14:22.780" style="s2">mode that we go into and we discuss</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.420" end="01:14:25.270" style="s2">something that is very uncertain and on</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.780" end="01:14:27.790" style="s2">which something important rests and it</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.270" end="01:14:30.820" style="s2">involves figuring out how to isolate</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.790" end="01:14:33.580" style="s2">your beliefs so that you can discuss</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.820" end="01:14:36.820" style="s2">them without them being altered alright</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.580" end="01:14:39.610" style="s2">so in other words there&#39;s some sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.820" end="01:14:41.290" style="s2">formalization and discussion about all</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.610" end="01:14:43.420" style="s2">right I&#39;m gonna lock down what I believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.290" end="01:14:44.710" style="s2">about this topic you lock down what you</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.420" end="01:14:46.120" style="s2">believe about this top</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.710" end="01:14:47.860" style="s2">then we&#39;re gonna meet and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.120" end="01:14:49.630" style="s2">discuss whether or not thus the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.860" end="01:14:52.930" style="s2">beliefs we turn out to have the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.630" end="01:14:54.160" style="s2">belief then okay that gives us increased</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.930" end="01:14:56.380" style="s2">confidence that there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.160" end="01:14:57.880" style="s2">something true about that belief if we</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.380" end="01:15:00.190" style="s2">find out that we&#39;re actually in</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.880" end="01:15:00.610" style="s2">different places when we meet in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.190" end="01:15:03.670" style="s2">middle</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.610" end="01:15:05.800" style="s2">then we step very carefully because at</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.670" end="01:15:08.650" style="s2">least having formalized our belief</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.800" end="01:15:12.730" style="s2">before our position moves allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.650" end="01:15:14.890" style="s2">say okay I made a jump right that means</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.730" end="01:15:16.690" style="s2">if it turns out that down the road that</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.890" end="01:15:18.790" style="s2">jump was counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.690" end="01:15:20.080" style="s2">I can probably unmake that jump I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.790" end="01:15:21.820" style="s2">remember what it was like to think that</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.080" end="01:15:23.380" style="s2">other thing beforehand whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.820" end="01:15:26.410" style="s2">natural tendency in informal</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.380" end="01:15:28.600" style="s2">conversation is for your position to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.410" end="01:15:32.590" style="s2">move as you are persuaded and</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.600" end="01:15:35.200" style="s2">unfortunately many people are unduly</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.590" end="01:15:37.660" style="s2">persuaded by somebody else&#39;s intensity</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.200" end="01:15:39.910" style="s2">of belief so it&#39;s a sort of a cultivated</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.660" end="01:15:41.650" style="s2">skill that you will avoid being</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.910" end="01:15:44.340" style="s2">persuaded by the fact that somebody that</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.650" end="01:15:48.760" style="s2">you like is very convinced of something</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.340" end="01:15:53.800" style="s2">so what I would argue is that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.760" end="01:15:55.390" style="s2">have conversations right I mean those</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.800" end="01:15:57.160" style="s2">people that we were discussing are</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.390" end="01:16:00.610" style="s2">connected socially they will have</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.160" end="01:16:02.410" style="s2">discussions and it is natural for those</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.610" end="01:16:04.210" style="s2">discussions to have some overlap with</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.410" end="01:16:06.940" style="s2">this territory but maybe there needs to</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.210" end="01:16:09.270" style="s2">be some formalization around how to make</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.940" end="01:16:12.310" style="s2">sure that the conversations don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.270" end="01:16:14.260" style="s2">synonymous or average or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.310" end="01:16:16.060" style="s2">that they will tend to do so that their</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.260" end="01:16:18.370" style="s2">independence from each other can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.060" end="01:16:20.920" style="s2">utilized you know you know in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.370" end="01:16:23.560" style="s2">functional Academy this would be the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.920" end="01:16:26.230" style="s2">different laboratories studying the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.560" end="01:16:28.270" style="s2">question would function it would be the</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.230" end="01:16:30.640" style="s2">way different schools of thought behave</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.270" end="01:16:32.260" style="s2">there would be interaction between them</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.640" end="01:16:34.450" style="s2">but there would also be enough</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.260" end="01:16:37.090" style="s2">insulation that we could sort of track</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.450" end="01:16:39.820" style="s2">the development of what happened when</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.090" end="01:16:41.740" style="s2">the question of spore mode that Jim</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.820" end="01:16:45.750" style="s2">wrought raised whether at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.740" end="01:16:48.010" style="s2">Stanton meetings the game be entity</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.750" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">dispersed to the wind and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.010" end="01:16:54.840" style="s2">independent nodes in that discussion</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:57.750" style="s2">were germinating the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.840" end="01:16:59.670" style="s2">there&#39;s some potential truth in that but</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.750" end="01:17:02.370" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned that that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.670" end="01:17:07.740" style="s2">what happened and that because the idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.370" end="01:17:14.220" style="s2">of game be reawakened in the age of</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.740" end="01:17:21.620" style="s2">social media and YouTube that what we</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.220" end="01:17:21.620" style="s2">have is an idea loosely defined that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:28.290" style="s2">because there is a lot of energy around</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.620" end="01:17:30.300" style="s2">the idea of living in the better world</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.290" end="01:17:34.230" style="s2">that is loosely proposed in that</p>

<p begin="01:17:34.230" end="01:17:43.610" style="s2">developing in a space that not only has</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.680" end="01:17:46.290" style="s2">no proper rule set but is also has no</p>

<p begin="01:17:46.290" end="01:17:50.730" style="s2">discussions like this are productive</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.750" end="01:17:52.680" style="s2">frankly we don&#39;t know and I think have</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.730" end="01:17:54.870" style="s2">strong reason to believe that we&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="01:18:01.800" end="01:18:06.600" style="s2">we need to be very careful about what it</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.230" end="01:18:10.410" style="s2">means the spore mode is a very loose</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.410" end="01:18:14.790" style="s2">the spores germinated and were again in</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.800" end="01:18:24.470" style="s2">immediately challenged the idea that</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.020" end="01:18:37.590" style="s2">have to say I&#39;m a little bit at a</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">disadvantage talking about the</p>

<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:46.620" style="s2">because I have stayed out of it and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.170" end="01:18:48.330" style="s2">stayed out of it for some very</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.620" end="01:18:50.910" style="s2">intentional reasons and then some other</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.330" end="01:18:54.800" style="s2">reasons that were just happenstance the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.910" end="01:19:01.760" style="s2">intentional reason is that I have seen</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.800" end="01:19:05.070" style="s2">the power of beliefs persuade people of</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:07.090" style="s2">fictions and I know this process to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.070" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">very difficult to resist</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.090" end="01:19:11.260" style="s2">if you were in those conversations day</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:14.020" style="s2">in and day out so they kind of your</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.260" end="01:19:15.369" style="s2">belief system gets chiseled away at just</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.020" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">by virtue of the fact that lots of</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.369" end="01:19:21.670" style="s2">people are repeating something that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:23.409" style="s2">just lose the ability to to protect so</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.670" end="01:19:25.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve stayed out of it in part because I</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.409" end="01:19:28.300" style="s2">don&#39;t think the conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.050" end="01:19:31.330" style="s2">productive enough to justify that hazard</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.300" end="01:19:34.239" style="s2">the independence of thought is valuable</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.330" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">enough to be worth staying out and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.239" end="01:19:41.460" style="s2">of course there&#39;s the circumstances that</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:44.679" style="s2">unfolded around my exit from Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.460" end="01:19:46.449" style="s2">which made Facebook in particular an</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.679" end="01:19:49.810" style="s2">almost impossible place for me to</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.449" end="01:19:51.969" style="s2">tolerate so I had been a user of</p>

<p begin="01:19:53.320" end="01:19:58.690" style="s2">Facebook and at the point that Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.360" end="01:20:00.489" style="s2">came apart I stepped away from it and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.690" end="01:20:03.130" style="s2">really haven&#39;t been able to go back just</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.489" end="01:20:10.480" style="s2">by virtue of what sort of discussion it</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.130" end="01:20:12.460" style="s2">is so I can&#39;t speak to the particulars</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:18.969" style="s2">of the discussion but I can say in</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.460" end="01:20:24.639" style="s2">general a large freeform discussion in</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.969" end="01:20:27.820" style="s2">which people gather as a result of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.639" end="01:20:29.920" style="s2">appeal of some concept those discussions</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.820" end="01:20:32.830" style="s2">are not likely to be highly fruitful</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.920" end="01:20:34.869" style="s2">because the the curation that has to go</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.830" end="01:20:37.090" style="s2">on at the door in order to create one of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.869" end="01:20:39.219" style="s2">these highly generative but fragile</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.090" end="01:20:42.040" style="s2">conversations needs to be better than</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.219" end="01:20:44.889" style="s2">that but if we define freedom in terms</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.040" end="01:20:47.469" style="s2">of how much Liberty you actually have</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.889" end="01:20:49.270" style="s2">that you can act upon right that you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.469" end="01:20:52.710" style="s2">engage in the real world then we will</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.270" end="01:20:56.170" style="s2">discover a couple of things one is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.710" end="01:20:58.690" style="s2">if you have achieved great deals of</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.170" end="01:21:00.670" style="s2">realized freedom that you have probably</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.690" end="01:21:04.349" style="s2">achieved all of the other goals and</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.670" end="01:21:06.670" style="s2">balanced them in a way that is desirable</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.349" end="01:21:08.380" style="s2">what what are your biggest takeaways</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.670" end="01:21:09.909" style="s2">when you look back on that time and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.380" end="01:21:11.199" style="s2">sort of look at where we&#39;re at now what</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.909" end="01:21:13.150" style="s2">are your biggest takeaway is what do you</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.199" end="01:21:16.420" style="s2">look back and think I think we were damn</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.150" end="01:21:19.820" style="s2">prescient that things would get worse</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.420" end="01:21:22.909" style="s2">which they certainly have we were</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.820" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">a little prescient about the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.909" end="01:21:26.810" style="s2">we were rapidly approaching the limits</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:30.050" style="s2">of the ecosystem I think that was one</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.810" end="01:21:33.590" style="s2">area where we were not as prescient as</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.050" end="01:21:36.860" style="s2">we could have been and so there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.590" end="01:21:40.520" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I think that we it</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.860" end="01:21:43.849" style="s2">highlights to me the tremendous failure</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.520" end="01:21:46.040" style="s2">of organizational design and dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.849" end="01:21:48.460" style="s2">above all else and that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.040" end="01:21:51.320" style="s2">the forest land rework may well be</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.460" end="01:21:53.810" style="s2">critical to neo game B succeeding or</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.320" end="01:21:55.849" style="s2">failing or if not his than somebody</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.810" end="01:21:58.099" style="s2">else&#39;s but I should say this is very</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.849" end="01:21:59.300" style="s2">important that any high dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.099" end="01:22:02.030" style="s2">complex systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.300" end="01:22:04.010" style="s2">you cannot say in advance whether X will</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.030" end="01:22:05.659" style="s2">work you&#39;ve got to take it</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.010" end="01:22:07.610" style="s2">experimentalist perspective you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.659" end="01:22:09.639" style="s2">to try it and I know he believes this as</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.610" end="01:22:12.409" style="s2">well he wants to try it on two groups</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.639" end="01:22:14.929" style="s2">relatively small than larger groups etc</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.409" end="01:22:16.760" style="s2">so all these tools and techniques the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.929" end="01:22:20.210" style="s2">piece parts for which we will build game</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.760" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">B have got to all be taken from an</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.210" end="01:22:26.060" style="s2">empirical experimental perspective tried</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:28.040" style="s2">and see if they work and if they do then</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.060" end="01:22:29.929" style="s2">that we vet that they are suitable for</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.040" end="01:22:31.449" style="s2">at least the early stages a game B maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.929" end="01:22:33.619" style="s2">we turns out they&#39;re only good for up to</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.449" end="01:22:35.780" style="s2">2,500 people and you have to rethink it</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.619" end="01:22:37.820" style="s2">so I would strongly suggest to those</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.780" end="01:22:38.599" style="s2">interested in game B stay light on your</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.820" end="01:22:40.489" style="s2">feet</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.599" end="01:22:43.130" style="s2">don&#39;t make over strong commitments to</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.489" end="01:22:44.329" style="s2">anything when things stop working pitch</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.130" end="01:22:46.670" style="s2">them and try something else</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.329" end="01:22:48.290" style="s2">mmm yeah I think that&#39;s kind of my last</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.670" end="01:22:50.090" style="s2">question is what advice would you have</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.290" end="01:22:52.969" style="s2">for people just discovering this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.090" end="01:22:55.280" style="s2">space or the Neo game B where where did</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.969" end="01:22:57.679" style="s2">it go from here that&#39;s a excellent</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.280" end="01:22:59.329" style="s2">question you know there&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.679" end="01:23:02.690" style="s2">probably a couple of different</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.329" end="01:23:04.880" style="s2">directions one is because of the nature</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.690" end="01:23:07.219" style="s2">of the foundations of game B it will be</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.880" end="01:23:11.090" style="s2">a talking shop forever there will be</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.219" end="01:23:15.460" style="s2">people bloviating about various and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.090" end="01:23:18.260" style="s2">sundry game B related topics both</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.460" end="01:23:20.480" style="s2">allegedly practical and others purely</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.260" end="01:23:22.760" style="s2">theoretical forever that&#39;s it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.480" end="01:23:26.239" style="s2">into the DNA and if you want to blow v8</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.760" end="01:23:28.550" style="s2">you can find fellow bloviator that to to</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.239" end="01:23:30.440" style="s2">the cows come home on the other hand I</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.550" end="01:23:32.630" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t suggest it&#39;s time for more</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.440" end="01:23:33.260" style="s2">doers to show up and particularly on</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.630" end="01:23:35.420" style="s2">Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.260" end="01:23:37.010" style="s2">maybe there are people now pounding the</p>

<p begin="01:24:03.889" end="01:24:08.510" style="s2">they&#39;re informed with game B ethos and</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.690" end="01:24:11.510" style="s2">if it works report back you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.510" end="01:24:13.099" style="s2">a big key part do experiments report</p>

<p begin="01:24:29.420" end="01:24:33.230" style="s2">about a lot about them yes well how to</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.940" end="01:24:35.090" style="s2">run and not a build and run an</p>

<p begin="01:24:39.650" end="01:24:44.809" style="s2">from health care right but we in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.590" end="01:24:46.519" style="s2">United States way too much talk about</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.809" end="01:24:48.409" style="s2">health care when really what we want is</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.519" end="01:24:51.559" style="s2">health and that includes eating good</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.409" end="01:24:53.570" style="s2">food exercising plenty you know not</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.559" end="01:24:56.599" style="s2">being annoyed by being overstressed by</p>

<p begin="01:24:59.119" end="01:25:07.909" style="s2">perspective on health was clearly a</p>

<p begin="01:25:07.909" end="01:25:14.210" style="s2">health was it was always a strong</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.320" end="01:25:16.639" style="s2">interest in food and clean food local</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.210" end="01:25:19.730" style="s2">food you know food that could be that</p>
