<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:06.120" style="s2">with meaning let&#39;s just say it&#39;s oh I</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:08.599" style="s2">think it is I think that that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">connectedness with what is that affords</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.599" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">transformation is what people are even</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:14.820" style="s2">talking about in the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">literature ultimately about meaning yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:20.609" style="s2">so two things come up then to tie back</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:22.199" style="s2">to previous things like that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.609" end="00:00:23.580" style="s2">discussion of the origin I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.199" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">resonates with the discussion we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.580" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">having about tradition and then yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">then I think I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:32.489" style="s2">Enlightenment right and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:35.430" style="s2">Enlightenment rejection of tradition as</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.489" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">an oppressive it&#39;s a gnostic attitude</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.430" end="00:00:41.219" style="s2">right it&#39;s in the pejorative sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">gnostic the rejection of tradition as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.219" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">oppressive structure right that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">keeping us you know from the promised</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">future or something like that and then I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:55.579" style="s2">think that is bound up with what we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">also discussing this truncation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.579" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">rationality down to basically monologic</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">inferential argumentation and losing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">connection with Rati oh and logos those</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">two things seem to be coming to meet</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.659" style="s2">together at sort of a historical moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">in the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.659" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">mmm-hmm and that&#39;s pertinent to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:19.549" style="s2">because we have people obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">question comes to mind is steven pinker</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.549" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">yeah basically saying enlightenment now</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">right there the problem is the doubling</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">down right the the the idea the problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">is we were just we just not accepting</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">how really really wonderful the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">Enlightenment is and again to be high to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">garyun about this is to not deny and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">seriously to not deny everything the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">Enlightenment has given us right and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">you know science isn&#39;t is an important</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">thing I&#39;m a scientist I value it you</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">know the increase in in health care that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.470" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">is not a minor thing in human existence</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">etc so not and so and he puts up all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">his graphs and there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:03.420" style="s2">denying that well actually some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">graphs I think are controversial but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.420" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">there&#39;s no denying most of the graphs</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">but that&#39;s but there&#39;s a sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">the graphs for all the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:13.540" style="s2">they&#39;re graphic they missed the point</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:16.659" style="s2">they missed the point of what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.540" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">like how the enlightenment again cut us</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.659" end="00:02:22.390" style="s2">off from Rotti Oh and cut us off from</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:25.959" style="s2">tradition and in that significant deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.390" end="00:02:31.109" style="s2">way cut us off from a cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.959" end="00:02:37.329" style="s2">grammar for falling in love with being</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.109" end="00:02:40.150" style="s2">yes yeah it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s yeah to make a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.329" end="00:02:42.790" style="s2">Haida garyun point of full agreement the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.150" end="00:02:45.909" style="s2">trouble is and enlightenment forgets</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.790" end="00:02:49.180" style="s2">darkness concealment and yes in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.909" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">horror right yes yes that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.180" end="00:02:54.790" style="s2">sacred is the horror yeah if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:56.530" style="s2">open to horror you&#39;re closed off to all</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.790" end="00:02:59.169" style="s2">and if you&#39;re closed off to aw</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.530" end="00:03:00.669" style="s2">you wonder differs from curiosity in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.169" end="00:03:05.230" style="s2">that wonder calls everything into</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.669" end="00:03:07.150" style="s2">question yeah but but yes and and on top</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.230" end="00:03:09.430" style="s2">of that you could say horror comes back</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.150" end="00:03:10.510" style="s2">to haunt you yes different level and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.430" end="00:03:12.220" style="s2">more from the middle and then you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.510" end="00:03:15.189" style="s2">longer even capable of dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.220" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">because you&#39;re not used to it being</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.189" end="00:03:19.030" style="s2">there being part at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:23.560" style="s2">existence you could say what why is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.030" end="00:03:29.049" style="s2">death so so extremely outsourced or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.560" end="00:03:31.959" style="s2">not in in our epoch it&#39;s nobody spoke</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.049" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">about the the loneliness of the dying</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.959" end="00:03:37.659" style="s2">this is a tremendous societal problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:39.609" style="s2">but death itself what is it for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.659" end="00:03:42.849" style="s2">Greeks for the Greeks death is at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.609" end="00:03:45.940" style="s2">heart is an irresolvable mystery or</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.849" end="00:03:48.010" style="s2">problem at the heart of off of existence</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.940" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">but for us today it&#39;s according to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.010" end="00:03:53.500" style="s2">Harare just a technical problem waiting</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">to be solved right and and I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.500" end="00:03:57.069" style="s2">pink it would be in agreement with her</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:59.829" style="s2">are we here I don&#39;t know but when I that</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.080" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">hopefully not as bad as some some have</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:08.590" style="s2">had to go through but still this is not</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:26.300" style="s2">agree with that I think that was very</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.820" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">very well said yeah it strikes me even</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.300" end="00:05:30.760" style="s2">if we move to the sort of popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:35.180" style="s2">culture because I talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.760" end="00:05:37.100" style="s2">talked about how even in my class how in</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:38.660" style="s2">fact even many of the movies we call</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.100" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">horror movies are not horror movies</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.660" end="00:05:42.740" style="s2">they&#39;re just you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:44.150" style="s2">I call them startled and puncture movies</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.740" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">they&#39;re just movies that are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.150" end="00:05:47.690" style="s2">give us more and more intense</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">experiences of our fear of predation</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.690" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">we&#39;re wired to be afraid of predators</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">because we you know our you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:57.260" style="s2">the previously we would preyed on for</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.650" end="00:05:58.760" style="s2">very long time so that deep in us so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.260" end="00:06:01.610" style="s2">can push that button just like you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.760" end="00:06:03.560" style="s2">push you know the glucose button and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.610" end="00:06:06.350" style="s2">people will gorge on sugar and they will</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.560" end="00:06:08.419" style="s2">gorge on the fear of predation but</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.350" end="00:06:11.240" style="s2">there&#39;s very few movies that actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.419" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">give you like there should be something</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.240" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">that&#39;s on the same scale let&#39;s just be</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:18.050" style="s2">an aspect of wonder in horror like in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:20.419" style="s2">wonder you call yourself and your grip</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:23.419" style="s2">on reality right into question and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.419" end="00:06:25.160" style="s2">Horesh be like where you and your sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.419" end="00:06:26.750" style="s2">of self and your sense of your grip on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.160" end="00:06:28.610" style="s2">things it&#39;s called radically into</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.750" end="00:06:31.160" style="s2">question now there are some I found a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.610" end="00:06:33.229" style="s2">few there are a couple of movies that do</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.160" end="00:06:34.640" style="s2">do that they try to do horror but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.229" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">think it bespeaks the point we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.640" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">talking about that popular culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:39.800" style="s2">actually also and this is such a high to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.780" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">get anything a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.800" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">it hides horror under the mask of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:49.069" style="s2">it calls were it actually prevents us</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:51.379" style="s2">from encountering or yeah right but this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.069" end="00:06:53.629" style="s2">mask on front of it which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.379" end="00:06:56.210" style="s2">basically a monster to be killed like</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.629" end="00:06:57.470" style="s2">like all you have to do is actually if</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.210" end="00:06:59.569" style="s2">you could just face your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.470" end="00:07:02.330" style="s2">predation and turn and face the monster</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.569" end="00:07:06.590" style="s2">yeah the doctor da right kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.330" end="00:07:11.050" style="s2">what it has no right horror should</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.590" end="00:07:15.020" style="s2">should leave you with a mystery that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:17.180" style="s2">undermines your sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.020" end="00:07:19.370" style="s2">ultimate security that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.180" end="00:07:21.530" style="s2">horror should do for you a joke it</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.370" end="00:07:24.770" style="s2">should be like it should have asked in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.530" end="00:07:26.690" style="s2">my to my mind it should have aspects I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.770" end="00:07:31.400" style="s2">think it is just psychologically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:34.069" style="s2">not a continuum with awe and Wonder yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.400" end="00:07:38.629" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s something you said about</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.069" end="00:07:41.719" style="s2">about like bringing in a contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.629" end="00:07:43.340" style="s2">culture right it&#39;s like where is it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.719" end="00:07:47.479" style="s2">this is one of the things I&#39;m I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.340" end="00:07:51.620" style="s2">I&#39;m getting more of a sense of okay to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.479" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">relate with to look for the place that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.620" end="00:07:57.889" style="s2">where we can genuinely find the horror</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">right is the senses with which what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.889" end="00:08:04.669" style="s2">really interesting is that and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">one of the things about the this notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.669" end="00:08:11.029" style="s2">of like detect the age of Technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:14.330" style="s2">right is is that for example when I go</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.029" end="00:08:17.000" style="s2">to actually I was in Atlanta visiting my</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.330" end="00:08:19.219" style="s2">mom she lives in Atlanta and we went to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.000" end="00:08:21.639" style="s2">this some this temple that they had</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.219" end="00:08:27.379" style="s2">actually shipped over block-by-block</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.639" end="00:08:32.110" style="s2">from India and was a it was a like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.379" end="00:08:34.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like a Hindu temple like to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.110" end="00:08:37.479" style="s2">however I went in there and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.760" end="00:08:40.789" style="s2">thing and every single part of it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.479" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">carved and animated and told the story</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.789" end="00:08:44.870" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t even know what the story</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:47.720" style="s2">was I couldn&#39;t understand it but like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.870" end="00:08:50.779" style="s2">you just it communicated just this deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.720" end="00:08:52.459" style="s2">sense of this ever and fractal in sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.779" end="00:08:53.060" style="s2">of yeah</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.450" end="00:09:15.560" style="s2">looked up and I looked across the street</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.160" end="00:09:18.830" style="s2">and there&#39;s this like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.560" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">shopping center thank and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.830" end="00:09:28.730" style="s2">people walking along and like this awful</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">this whole Road right with and I just I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.730" end="00:09:33.980" style="s2">was so struck and horrified but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:37.640" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s like here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.980" end="00:09:41.330" style="s2">that seems horrifying it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.640" end="00:09:45.080" style="s2">not that we live in places like that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.330" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">that they exist it&#39;s that and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.080" end="00:09:50.060" style="s2">they&#39;re horrifying the horror is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:54.980" style="s2">everybody&#39;s walking around and nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.060" end="00:09:56.770" style="s2">saying this is horrible right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.980" end="00:10:00.950" style="s2">very few people that are walking around</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.770" end="00:10:03.800" style="s2">you&#39;re just in the flow of it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.950" end="00:10:06.230" style="s2">they&#39;re as you look like at these houses</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.800" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">that are the same it&#39;s just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.230" end="00:10:10.760" style="s2">of difference like buildings are built</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:13.610" style="s2">to look like something right versus</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.760" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">being something right yeah yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.610" end="00:10:18.710" style="s2">a that&#39;s where I feel a particular if</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:21.080" style="s2">the thing the thing that is horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.710" end="00:10:23.000" style="s2">and fascinating and I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.080" end="00:10:26.540" style="s2">this is like an example of starting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.000" end="00:10:28.310" style="s2">actually look at the withdrawal right</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.540" end="00:10:31.400" style="s2">seeing the withdrawal and being in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.310" end="00:10:33.470" style="s2">relationship to it is it seems like part</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.400" end="00:10:37.730" style="s2">of the withdrawal is no one is noticing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.470" end="00:10:39.620" style="s2">the withdrawal right isn&#39;t that what</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.730" end="00:10:42.320" style="s2">well yeah Nietzsche says in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.620" end="00:10:44.390" style="s2">genealogy of morality and to all these P</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.320" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">also speaks at the whole robach we so</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.390" end="00:10:50.630" style="s2">the shihoro of emptiness and he says</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">rather than not willing the will wants</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.630" end="00:10:56.630" style="s2">nothing all right so I just I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:59.029" style="s2">become a great destroyer yeah yeah Fromm</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.630" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">said that too right wait and when people</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.029" end="00:11:02.630" style="s2">can&#39;t make anything they&#39;d rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:04.910" style="s2">doing nothing they&#39;d rather smash</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.630" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">everything down because at least at</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:10.370" style="s2">least they&#39;ve got the last</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:12.440" style="s2">messages of their agency yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.370" end="00:11:13.790" style="s2">so I wondering what about what I just</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.440" end="00:11:15.260" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.790" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which people and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.260" end="00:11:18.470" style="s2">mean that was part of the whole book</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.760" end="00:11:19.160" style="s2">that I wrote with Chris and Philip like</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.470" end="00:11:21.470" style="s2">a zombie</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">the zombie is is the is the being that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.470" end="00:11:26.180" style="s2">is completely unaware of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:28.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a zombie that it disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.180" end="00:11:29.930" style="s2">the world from itself from its Jeff</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.279" end="00:11:32.930" style="s2">the zombie is all of the disconnections</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.930" end="00:11:36.110" style="s2">unaware of the disconnections and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:38.209" style="s2">symbol but you know Leo and Anderson I</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:40.699" style="s2">we&#39;ve reviewed a couple of movies on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.209" end="00:11:43.670" style="s2">week that are going to come out on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.699" end="00:11:47.180" style="s2">minding media with Joker in which you</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.670" end="00:11:50.149" style="s2">see a shift from the zombie to something</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.180" end="00:11:53.029" style="s2">were like and it goes to the point we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.149" end="00:11:54.680" style="s2">just spoke about where now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.029" end="00:11:57.380" style="s2">Joker who spoilers here by the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.680" end="00:11:58.940" style="s2">spoilers Joker is about the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.380" end="00:12:01.250" style="s2">crisis I think that&#39;s very clear because</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.940" end="00:12:03.500" style="s2">you know all of the tropes of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.250" end="00:12:05.690" style="s2">you know his connection to his past is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.500" end="00:12:08.389" style="s2">undermined if the very story that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.690" end="00:12:09.860" style="s2">watching we lose any sense of dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.389" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">irony because we don&#39;t know what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.860" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">and not in it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:17.449" style="s2">his name is oxymoronic he&#39;s Arthur the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:18.740" style="s2">great king Fleck I mean is immediately a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.449" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">meaningless piece of crap</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.740" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">Arthur flack like you know come getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:27.290" style="s2">pounded over the head and then we see</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:31.160" style="s2">him sort of devolve into all he wants is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.290" end="00:12:34.040" style="s2">whatever kind of attention is left right</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.160" end="00:12:35.990" style="s2">that&#39;s all right there&#39;s no meaning no</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.040" end="00:12:39.620" style="s2">value no connectedness it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.990" end="00:12:41.180" style="s2">just the sheer it&#39;s even beyond like is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.620" end="00:12:44.620" style="s2">even beyond sort of destructiveness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.180" end="00:12:48.130" style="s2">just right the you know the last</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.620" end="00:12:50.690" style="s2">narcissism is the last vestige of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.130" end="00:12:52.670" style="s2">attention that well at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.690" end="00:12:54.829" style="s2">things are people are still paying</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.670" end="00:12:57.050" style="s2">attention to me and then what was</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.829" end="00:12:59.870" style="s2">interesting about that is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.050" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">way the way again what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.870" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">about instead of the shuffling zombies</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:09.110" style="s2">at the shopping mall</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">you have the angry crowd in riot focused</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.110" end="00:13:16.310" style="s2">on a figure that&#39;s not a leader in any</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:18.649" style="s2">sense but who what who what what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.310" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">doing is he&#39;s trying to make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.649" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">environment as absurd as</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:25.550" style="s2">narcissism because that&#39;s the last bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:27.470" style="s2">of conformity that&#39;s possible for him</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.550" end="00:13:30.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the last bit of him having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.470" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">connection to reality available to him</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.230" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">right and so you I think and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:39.050" style="s2">that that movie was so like popular and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:41.029" style="s2">got so much attention yes I people</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.050" end="00:13:43.130" style="s2">aren&#39;t talking about it and so you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.130" end="00:13:48.649" style="s2">afraid that we&#39;re actually moving to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.790" end="00:13:51.260" style="s2">something beyond them not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.649" end="00:13:53.480" style="s2">it I think we&#39;re moving to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.260" end="00:13:56.990" style="s2">possibility that they might start acting</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.480" end="00:13:58.610" style="s2">out from it not acting on it but you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.990" end="00:14:00.440" style="s2">know how we talk about somebody acting</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.610" end="00:14:02.449" style="s2">out like when they&#39;re acting out like</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.440" end="00:14:04.699" style="s2">when a child is acting out an issue that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.449" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t properly understand right</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.699" end="00:14:08.510" style="s2">that that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to use that</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.070" end="00:14:19.610" style="s2">is shifting from the zombie horde to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">like the north the the the violent</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.610" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">absurdist narcissist I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">something you really really pay</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:33.500" style="s2">attention to and for me that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:37.160" style="s2">brought with it again a kind of horror</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.500" end="00:14:40.040" style="s2">that goes beyond so I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.160" end="00:14:41.870" style="s2">trump you or anything guy on the horror</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.040" end="00:14:44.269" style="s2">of the zombie the horror of the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.870" end="00:14:46.940" style="s2">is that bacon see right but the horror</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.269" end="00:14:50.569" style="s2">of Joker is it it&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.940" end="00:14:53.149" style="s2">it&#39;s that this is now twisting in a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.569" end="00:14:57.350" style="s2">that I think is extremely dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.149" end="00:14:59.660" style="s2">extremely dangerous if if if it portends</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.350" end="00:15:02.269" style="s2">if it is I think if the movie isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.660" end="00:15:04.220" style="s2">a movie it is a myth of some kind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.269" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">emerging the fact that it takes place</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.220" end="00:15:09.380" style="s2">around a mythic character is also you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:13.579" style="s2">know kind of kind of something</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.380" end="00:15:15.139" style="s2">thought-provoking I would say this is I</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.579" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">just want to make sure I got what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.139" end="00:15:19.250" style="s2">saying like that the extra that the new</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">loop around right which is it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.250" end="00:15:28.370" style="s2">a vacancy right being a zombie it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">I act out of being that that vacancy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.370" end="00:15:33.230" style="s2">my only the thing you said about</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:35.540" style="s2">conformities the last conformity</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.230" end="00:15:38.450" style="s2">I am left to last way in which I can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.540" end="00:15:41.000" style="s2">identical to the unfolding of being is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.450" end="00:15:43.700" style="s2">if being is private if the unfolding of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.000" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">being is primarily absurdity right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.700" end="00:15:46.580" style="s2">especially if that&#39;s how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:49.100" style="s2">participating in it because a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.580" end="00:15:52.040" style="s2">narcissists existence is one of enacted</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.100" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">embodied absurdity like if then I&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.040" end="00:15:58.040" style="s2">can if I can you know if I can make the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:16:00.140" style="s2">absurdity out there as comprehensive as</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.040" end="00:16:03.710" style="s2">possible than it then at least I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.140" end="00:16:06.890" style="s2">that final last ditch connect connection</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.710" end="00:16:10.190" style="s2">to dance but this is extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.890" end="00:16:13.790" style="s2">to think this through further and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.190" end="00:16:15.770" style="s2">and it also make as many people as</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.790" end="00:16:19.340" style="s2">possible aware because I think what</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.770" end="00:16:20.900" style="s2">we&#39;re pushing against is is is you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.340" end="00:16:24.040" style="s2">call it late modern subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.900" end="00:16:28.510" style="s2">hyper-modern subjectivity exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.040" end="00:16:32.390" style="s2">subjectivity collapsing into itself and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.510" end="00:16:34.730" style="s2">it&#39;s this it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.390" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">you can see how it&#39;s losing its grip on</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.730" end="00:16:38.960" style="s2">reality how it&#39;s losing its sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:41.270" style="s2">certainty that it was given by Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.960" end="00:16:43.340" style="s2">and others right absolute sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.270" end="00:16:44.840" style="s2">certainty is now collapsing and all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.340" end="00:16:47.570" style="s2">left with is as you said is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.840" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">absurdity is being unfolding as absurd</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.570" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">and now all I can do to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:57.410" style="s2">anything or posit myself again is by</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:17:00.770" style="s2">acts of sheer and utter brutal violence</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">for example bring my horror that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.770" end="00:17:04.460" style="s2">cope with because the world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:06.530" style="s2">supposed to be horrible but somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.460" end="00:17:08.630" style="s2">completely absurd I bring this horror</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.530" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">into the world and I assert myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.630" end="00:17:12.920" style="s2">within and give myself some certainty</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:16.580" style="s2">before I ultimately collapse what I see</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.920" end="00:17:20.690" style="s2">in all of the madness is subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.580" end="00:17:23.060" style="s2">pushing to its utmost limited I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.690" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">that was beautifully said I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.060" end="00:17:29.000" style="s2">think that I think that developed my</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">point very well I really like what you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.000" end="00:17:33.950" style="s2">just said I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:39.500" style="s2">an that dimension you added is</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.950" end="00:17:42.230" style="s2">insightful it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.500" end="00:17:44.660" style="s2">like there is this there was a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.230" end="00:17:46.220" style="s2">that movie actually right as everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.660" end="00:17:49.270" style="s2">gathered along</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.220" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2">did it look very much like some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.270" end="00:17:56.929" style="s2">some of the the protests at Berkeley</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:17:58.909" style="s2">right like I remember walking out one</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.929" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">time I used to live right across the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.909" end="00:18:04.690" style="s2">street from Berkeley like the main</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:07.220" style="s2">campus and I we had a meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.690" end="00:18:09.590" style="s2">helicopters were going and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.220" end="00:18:12.020" style="s2">hearing noises and there&#39;s riots and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.590" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">it was just I don&#39;t know it was like Ben</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.020" end="00:18:19.390" style="s2">Shapiro or something speaking right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:22.100" style="s2">I walk outside and there was literally a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.390" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">hammer and sickle spray-painted on all</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">the buildings and it was this um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:29.450" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">this sense of like it was like it was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.450" end="00:18:35.000" style="s2">very moral stance like how could you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:37.580" style="s2">have this whatever whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.000" end="00:18:40.460" style="s2">assertion was about that person but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.580" end="00:18:45.470" style="s2">was like uncanny it was eerie walking</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.460" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">out in in the streets afterwards and yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.470" end="00:18:51.669" style="s2">it was very tied to a morality weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:54.409" style="s2">enough and I&#39;m and I&#39;m just I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.669" end="00:18:56.900" style="s2">when we at the end of that movie when</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.409" end="00:18:59.630" style="s2">everyone was like right like total</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.900" end="00:19:02.630" style="s2">immorality there&#39;s I do anything yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.630" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">and I mean and the thing is I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.630" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get into the politics of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:09.860" style="s2">this yeah yeah there it but but there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:13.220" style="s2">there is the collapsing of morality to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.860" end="00:19:16.280" style="s2">the assertion of rules and propositions</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.220" end="00:19:19.549" style="s2">so morality in those kinds of protests</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.280" end="00:19:22.429" style="s2">has been divested from virtue its</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.549" end="00:19:24.350" style="s2">disconnected from virtue in in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.429" end="00:19:27.049" style="s2">really really important ways that needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.350" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">to be talked about again I don&#39;t I I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.049" end="00:19:30.830" style="s2">don&#39;t want to claim that people within a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:34.070" style="s2">democracy shouldn&#39;t protest obviously</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.830" end="00:19:36.350" style="s2">good etc I&#39;m not I&#39;m clearly not saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.070" end="00:19:38.840" style="s2">that but what I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.350" end="00:19:41.539" style="s2">content in which the protest is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.840" end="00:19:43.730" style="s2">expressed not the fact or the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.539" end="00:19:47.059" style="s2">the protest okay so let&#39;s be clear about</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.730" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">that fact or the goal of protest when</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.059" end="00:19:50.600" style="s2">talking about the content in which it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:53.390" style="s2">expressed and whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.600" end="00:19:56.419" style="s2">expression actually sits well with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.390" end="00:19:57.289" style="s2">fact and the goals of protest I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.419" end="00:19:59.389" style="s2">claims to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.289" end="00:20:01.279" style="s2">it makes moral claims but</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.389" end="00:20:02.749" style="s2">when you when you separate morality I</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.279" end="00:20:06.169" style="s2">think from virtue especially the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.749" end="00:20:08.450" style="s2">the virtues of wisdom and courage right</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.169" end="00:20:11.359" style="s2">and software son then that your</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.450" end="00:20:15.229" style="s2">protestations literally about justice</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.359" end="00:20:17.029" style="s2">are going to be very hollow in an</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.229" end="00:20:19.519" style="s2">important sense that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.029" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">you know and then so I see that as</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.519" end="00:20:24.109" style="s2">actually what you get sort of before you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.059" style="s2">get what you see in Joker which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.109" end="00:20:28.599" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to you get the Prout the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.059" end="00:20:30.709" style="s2">protest that is just protest yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.599" end="00:20:33.190" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s not even it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.709" end="00:20:36.739" style="s2">it&#39;s even giving up the pretense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.190" end="00:20:39.229" style="s2">virtue signaling or or making moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.739" end="00:20:41.629" style="s2">assertions it&#39;s just smashing and anger</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.229" end="00:20:43.779" style="s2">and let&#39;s just let&#39;s make everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.629" end="00:20:46.639" style="s2">let&#39;s just let&#39;s just break apart</p>

<p begin="00:20:46.639" end="00:20:55.159" style="s2">structure itself intelligibility itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.359" end="00:20:55.759" style="s2">has now become oppressive to us yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.159" end="00:20:57.829" style="s2">agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.759" end="00:21:00.739" style="s2">I agree and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.829" end="00:21:01.849" style="s2">hmm now you see where we are we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.739" end="00:21:03.559" style="s2">the heck we&#39;re in the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.849" end="00:21:07.669" style="s2">meeting crisis when the dam is talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.559" end="00:21:09.649" style="s2">about the meaning crisis yeah do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.669" end="00:21:11.659" style="s2">think as a question on that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.649" end="00:21:14.389" style="s2">intelligibility has become oppressive to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.659" end="00:21:17.450" style="s2">us is that has that anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.389" end="00:21:21.379" style="s2">what I would think of his paranoia of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.450" end="00:21:26.119" style="s2">late modern subjectivity I I think so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.379" end="00:21:28.219" style="s2">III think that we&#39;ve lost and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.119" end="00:21:29.899" style="s2">like well you could correct me on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.219" end="00:21:32.659" style="s2">but I think this is something I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.899" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">see in Heidegger I see it also in bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.659" end="00:21:38.779" style="s2">consign in a way that intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:42.229" style="s2">supposed to be something that gets us</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.779" end="00:21:44.539" style="s2">beyond our subjectivity that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.229" end="00:21:46.339" style="s2">it is not just about what you get what</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.539" end="00:21:48.549" style="s2">starts to emerge right in the 11th</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.339" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">century it&#39;s not just internal coherence</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.549" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">amongst my my propositions right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:56.719" style="s2">not just the coherence yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:59.179" style="s2">that intelligibility is supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.719" end="00:22:01.309" style="s2">give me AK it&#39;s supposed to get it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.179" end="00:22:04.879" style="s2">supposed to give me some kind of access</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.309" end="00:22:09.259" style="s2">beyond my subjectivity and I think when</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.879" end="00:22:10.909" style="s2">you you lose that right when you when</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.259" end="00:22:12.410" style="s2">you lose that sense of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.909" end="00:22:15.110" style="s2">that way then of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.410" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">ah isn&#39;t it going to go from being like</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.110" end="00:22:19.160" style="s2">a lens through which you see if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:21.860" style="s2">allow me this metaphor it it has it had</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.160" end="00:22:24.020" style="s2">some bad connotations that I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.860" end="00:22:26.060" style="s2">but if it goes I want to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.020" end="00:22:27.710" style="s2">double sense of the word through right</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.060" end="00:22:30.440" style="s2">then intelligibility is something I see</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.710" end="00:22:32.840" style="s2">through like you know and and by means</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.440" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">up if I if I lose the sense of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:37.880" style="s2">through all I&#39;m gonna get is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">looking at and then that&#39;s a wall yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.880" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">right that&#39;s a wall right if I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.730" end="00:22:44.780" style="s2">through in both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">through that I&#39;m looking at that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.780" end="00:22:49.430" style="s2">wall and that all it is is just the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:51.590" style="s2">echoing of my own subjectivity it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.430" end="00:22:55.640" style="s2">the prison right it&#39;s just the prison I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.590" end="00:22:56.810" style="s2">think I think that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.640" end="00:22:58.580" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to with what you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.810" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">and I that that&#39;s how I that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.580" end="00:23:02.750" style="s2">placed so much like they talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:04.460" style="s2">about the transparency opacity shifting</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.750" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">of attention and we have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.460" end="00:23:09.260" style="s2">that and then we have to somehow work</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:14.270" style="s2">that back into our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.260" end="00:23:17.510" style="s2">understanding yeah yeah standing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.270" end="00:23:19.880" style="s2">yeah because what I think is that just</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.510" end="00:23:22.040" style="s2">in line with what you just said is so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.880" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">look at someone like 50 all right for 50</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.040" end="00:23:27.680" style="s2">50 says something along the lines of I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:29.180" style="s2">always recognize myself in nature he has</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.680" end="00:23:31.280" style="s2">to say that because nature is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.180" end="00:23:33.830" style="s2">fiction for him yeah you have Hegel and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:35.870" style="s2">Schelling who tried to rescue nature a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.830" end="00:23:38.540" style="s2">bit but that had didn&#39;t really work out</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.870" end="00:23:40.550" style="s2">and what I&#39;m trying to say said what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.540" end="00:23:42.890" style="s2">projectory were on is it the self</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.550" end="00:23:46.220" style="s2">certainty of the self asserting self</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.890" end="00:23:47.660" style="s2">referential subject or ego has lost its</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.220" end="00:23:50.780" style="s2">certainty with the death of God</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.660" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">it was importantly and because God let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.780" end="00:23:55.370" style="s2">not forget God it&#39;s a hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:57.350" style="s2">Laplace no longer needs right god is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.370" end="00:23:59.540" style="s2">hypothesis that descartes needs in order</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.350" end="00:24:03.080" style="s2">to guarantee that the world out there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.540" end="00:24:04.310" style="s2">actually there it&#39;s patience and make</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.080" end="00:24:06.710" style="s2">sure they&#39;re actually all these people</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.310" end="00:24:08.120" style="s2">out there they&#39;re not robots / psalm</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.710" end="00:24:10.250" style="s2">bees where they&#39;re actually human beings</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.120" end="00:24:11.540" style="s2">Scott makes sure of that but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.250" end="00:24:14.900" style="s2">really be sure of that myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.540" end="00:24:17.180" style="s2">is all I know is meaning me and once</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.900" end="00:24:20.540" style="s2">this certainty disappears once the cows</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.180" end="00:24:24.170" style="s2">are Suey this ungodly this non God like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.540" end="00:24:26.600" style="s2">God just evaporates into a never</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.170" end="00:24:29.870" style="s2">exploding non cosmos and black</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.600" end="00:24:33.230" style="s2">coal&#39;s what we&#39;re left with is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.870" end="00:24:37.130" style="s2">subjectivity doesn&#39;t know and can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.230" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">sense off so hence it it&#39;s as you said</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.130" end="00:24:42.620" style="s2">stuck in a wall fucking itself and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">reacts violently and I keep sitting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.620" end="00:24:46.160" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want to pin it down on</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:48.679" style="s2">anyone right because I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.160" end="00:24:51.980" style="s2">ultimately structural historical yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.679" end="00:24:56.390" style="s2">but but there is to me at least it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.980" end="00:24:58.429" style="s2">clearly are parts out of it and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.390" end="00:25:00.620" style="s2">have to do with what we talked about now</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.429" end="00:25:03.020" style="s2">is you could say you call it tradition</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.620" end="00:25:05.630" style="s2">you could call it sources or origin or</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.020" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">wisdom sources of wisdom etc those would</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.630" end="00:25:10.370" style="s2">be find that those would be different</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:12.350" style="s2">paths out of it into a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.370" end="00:25:15.260" style="s2">as you put an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.350" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">understanding that takes us out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.260" end="00:25:22.789" style="s2">ourselves and into this the non</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:26.570" style="s2">propositional collecting world well said</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.789" end="00:25:32.270" style="s2">well said beautifully said yes what did</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.570" end="00:25:36.770" style="s2">he just say here I just wanted something</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.270" end="00:25:40.700" style="s2">hit you there well I got from that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.770" end="00:25:42.830" style="s2">think I agree with the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.700" end="00:25:45.980" style="s2">know Descartes represents this pivot</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.830" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">point in which the conformity to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.980" end="00:25:51.140" style="s2">world is withdrawn until the specious</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">moment of self-conscious conformity with</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.140" end="00:25:56.179" style="s2">itself sort of pure subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">what Descartes needs is he needs he</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.179" end="00:26:00.530" style="s2">needs he needs right something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">gives him egress something that gives</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.530" end="00:26:05.059" style="s2">him a way out of that and God is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:07.130" style="s2">supposed to do that and but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.059" end="00:26:09.230" style="s2">god of certainty right this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.130" end="00:26:11.809" style="s2">god of sacredness this is the god of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.230" end="00:26:14.780" style="s2">certainty and the problem is that God</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.809" end="00:26:16.909" style="s2">ultimately it operates as johannes says</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:21.980" style="s2">and then what we get is we get trapped</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.909" end="00:26:23.840" style="s2">but within this subjectivity and I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.980" end="00:26:25.669" style="s2">it&#39;s not even that it becomes opaque I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.840" end="00:26:27.080" style="s2">would wanted to add that we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.669" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.080" end="00:26:33.110" style="s2">because if what you&#39;re trying to find is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.700" style="s2">the moment of certainty its vanish it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.110" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">like it&#39;s like almost like a singularity</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.700" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">you&#39;re vanishing and vanishing</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:41.000" style="s2">vanishing towards it and so the wall is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.710" style="s2">closing in and closing so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.000" end="00:26:43.880" style="s2">paranoia you&#39;ll haunt us I would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.710" end="00:26:48.570" style="s2">it might be something more like</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.880" end="00:26:51.610" style="s2">existential claustrophobia that were</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.570" end="00:26:53.809" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.610" end="00:26:58.070" style="s2">that&#39;s what I heard that&#39;s what I heard</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.809" end="00:27:00.519" style="s2">him saying yeah something it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.070" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">about like if I just sit if I sit with</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.519" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">alright so it&#39;s like there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">like claustrophobia I am like I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:13.730" style="s2">closed in right and the a rages come out</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:17.659" style="s2">like joke boobies like all of that so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.730" end="00:27:21.370" style="s2">we bring in if we bring back in Nick</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.659" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">Nick atashi the guy is returning yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.370" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">it&#39;s funny I just find myself going like</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:30.409" style="s2">okay so what is so if that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:35.000" style="s2">happening this is what how things are</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.409" end="00:27:36.409" style="s2">occurring for us right yeah yeah if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:39.169" style="s2">look at it like I just thought about</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.409" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">this of like okay what would what would</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.840" end="00:27:56.360" style="s2">had this sense of it would just go and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.260" end="00:27:59.299" style="s2">something you would about and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.360" end="00:28:00.830" style="s2">this is one of the things that I like</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.299" end="00:28:02.870" style="s2">kind of in a certain sense being right</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.429" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">but the other response would be I am</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.390" end="00:29:09.380" style="s2">but there is a sense of nothingness but</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.730" end="00:29:11.420" style="s2">in a different way that we think of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.380" end="00:29:15.890" style="s2">in the West right and beginning from</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.420" end="00:29:18.340" style="s2">this stance you open up again and this</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.020" end="00:29:27.260" style="s2">gonna say something that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.130" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">definitely convergent with that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.260" end="00:29:31.280" style="s2">mishit Ali would say as you move towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:34.250" style="s2">the center of the self you&#39;re not moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.280" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">to the foundational certainty what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.250" end="00:29:39.110" style="s2">do is you suddenly uncover the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">of the no thickness from which the self</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.110" end="00:29:43.820" style="s2">is always emerging but never in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.550" style="s2">sort of fixed and stabilized way and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.820" end="00:29:48.770" style="s2">you can get and that the end of like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.550" end="00:29:50.120" style="s2">know and I think I think James was</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.770" end="00:29:51.410" style="s2">getting towards us too when he made the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.120" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">distinction between the me and the I</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.410" end="00:29:55.370" style="s2">the words aren&#39;t totally right but</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:56.750" style="s2">that&#39;s what he was trying to get at he</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.370" end="00:30:00.020" style="s2">was trying to get out when you move</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.750" end="00:30:02.510" style="s2">towards the center you don&#39;t move to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.020" end="00:30:05.000" style="s2">fixed foundation you actually move into</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.510" end="00:30:10.370" style="s2">the no thickness you move into that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.000" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">aspect of mystery that is it is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.370" end="00:30:14.630" style="s2">like this metaphor but it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">center right you and so nishitani would</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.630" end="00:30:18.980" style="s2">point to the fact that if you follow it</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:20.540" style="s2">far enough in you find that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.980" end="00:30:23.390" style="s2">difference between moving in and moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.540" end="00:30:25.670" style="s2">out that there you find a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.390" end="00:30:28.280" style="s2">of conformity rather than the absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.670" end="00:30:30.410" style="s2">absurdity there&#39;s a deep conformity to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.280" end="00:30:33.290" style="s2">between the no thickness and the no</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.410" end="00:30:36.260" style="s2">thickness and then that affords right</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.290" end="00:30:38.390" style="s2">that affords you moving back into an</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.260" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">agog a that&#39;s what I see him</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.390" end="00:30:47.890" style="s2">basically articulating so that if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:51.620" style="s2">can see the no thickness as that which</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.890" end="00:30:55.700" style="s2">affords radical transfer aiming rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.620" end="00:30:59.570" style="s2">than as the privation of graspable</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.700" end="00:31:02.230" style="s2">securable actuality then you can get out</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.570" end="00:31:03.920" style="s2">of you can get out of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.230" end="00:31:06.260" style="s2">claustrophobia</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.920" end="00:31:08.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see him is saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.260" end="00:31:11.030" style="s2">because the West can only if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.840" end="00:31:12.920" style="s2">allow me to use these two words because</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.030" end="00:31:15.830" style="s2">the West can only represent no thickness</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.920" end="00:31:18.920" style="s2">as nothingness that it can&#39;t make that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.830" end="00:31:20.900" style="s2">move and so all it does is keep right it</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.920" end="00:31:24.650" style="s2">gets to that point it gets to that point</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.900" end="00:31:28.250" style="s2">yeah and then actuality we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.650" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">actuality to come back to that so what</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.250" end="00:31:33.560" style="s2">do you mean by that you&#39;re honest no but</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:35.450" style="s2">the self is the actual yes rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.560" end="00:31:36.650" style="s2">the potential or the possible sorry yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.450" end="00:31:41.150" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.650" end="00:31:43.220" style="s2">yes exactly I&#39;m sensei I&#39;m just sensing</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.150" end="00:31:46.490" style="s2">into that kind of figure ground shift of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.220" end="00:31:48.620" style="s2">like oh yeah it&#39;s a fundamental figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.490" end="00:31:50.600" style="s2">ground shift yes and it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.620" end="00:31:55.520" style="s2">perspective a participatory thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.600" end="00:31:58.040" style="s2">not an argumentative thing yeah yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.520" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">that equation because argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.040" end="00:32:03.290" style="s2">always works within a stabilized</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:04.190" style="s2">perspective and an existential mode and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.290" end="00:32:06.950" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.190" end="00:32:10.280" style="s2">reversal the argumentation can come</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.950" end="00:32:12.680" style="s2">after and perhaps age an explication and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.280" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">elucidation but the process itself is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.680" end="00:32:17.180" style="s2">not an argumentative process right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:19.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like really like I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.180" end="00:32:21.050" style="s2">about just the sense of so when I kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.430" end="00:32:23.140" style="s2">of just feel into it like one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.050" end="00:32:24.980" style="s2">like I I sign my taneous League oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.140" end="00:32:27.620" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of risk</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.980" end="00:32:30.350" style="s2">like if the walls Kerr coming in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.620" end="00:32:32.590" style="s2">like a risk I in some way actually have</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.350" end="00:32:32.590" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.960" end="00:32:39.570" style="s2">I&#39;d almost like let go of all of Western</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.420" end="00:32:42.900" style="s2">metaphysics right like there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.570" end="00:32:47.240" style="s2">some kind of leap in there of love</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.900" end="00:32:49.740" style="s2">rather than pushing away but actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.240" end="00:32:52.350" style="s2">whatever the experience is I keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.740" end="00:32:53.820" style="s2">getting the sense of keep watching it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.350" end="00:32:56.690" style="s2">not like I getting the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.820" end="00:33:01.260" style="s2">meditation in that sense of the word of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.690" end="00:33:04.980" style="s2">some kind of vulnerability to be with</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.260" end="00:33:06.690" style="s2">the horror and everything that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.980" end="00:33:08.370" style="s2">talking about I&#39;m just sensing a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.690" end="00:33:11.280" style="s2">kind of like a response is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.370" end="00:33:14.430" style="s2">kind of vulnerability there is I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.280" end="00:33:20.630" style="s2">mean within my own practice you get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.430" end="00:33:23.910" style="s2">this place where you step into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.630" end="00:33:26.400" style="s2">because you can&#39;t grasp it you can only</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.910" end="00:33:27.750" style="s2">be it you can you can feel I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.400" end="00:33:29.730" style="s2">youngness as language because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.750" end="00:33:31.890" style="s2">perfectly appropriate actually for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.730" end="00:33:35.130" style="s2">phenomenology you feel the perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.890" end="00:33:38.280" style="s2">withdrawal the meditation right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.130" end="00:33:40.710" style="s2">perpetual withdrawal you you suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.280" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like the back falls out from behind</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.710" end="00:33:45.210" style="s2">you that&#39;s why I like Jewish yes look</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:46.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a meditation you&#39;re stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.210" end="00:33:47.730" style="s2">and you&#39;re stepping back and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.230" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2">looking at and you&#39;re looking at and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.730" end="00:33:53.250" style="s2">then all of a sudden the what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:55.620" style="s2">stepping back into and you get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.250" end="00:33:58.350" style="s2">of like that that&#39;s why I like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.620" end="00:34:02.070" style="s2">noise that you get that sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.350" end="00:34:04.230" style="s2">know of withdrawal which is not the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.070" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">sense of a thing it&#39;s not even the sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.230" end="00:34:08.820" style="s2">of a presence it&#39;s that I I have no</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.740" style="s2">other word for it it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.820" end="00:34:12.810" style="s2">phenomenological experience of the sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.740" end="00:34:15.080" style="s2">of withdrawal and that can be initially</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.810" end="00:34:17.340" style="s2">really really as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.080" end="00:34:21.510" style="s2">horrifying to people it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.340" end="00:34:23.929" style="s2">horrifying right yeah especially having</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.510" end="00:34:26.899" style="s2">caught you know having had facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:31.500" style="s2">experiences of that horror that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.899" end="00:34:33.960" style="s2">like everything slipping away very thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.500" end="00:34:36.570" style="s2">that you just it&#39;s almost like the last</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.960" end="00:34:38.850" style="s2">bit of concern or care is glittering</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.570" end="00:34:41.100" style="s2">that and then at some point it goes then</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.850" end="00:34:42.450" style="s2">you&#39;re everywhere there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.100" end="00:34:44.850" style="s2">like that was a that&#39;s been my</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.450" end="00:34:46.830" style="s2">experiences with those places where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.850" end="00:34:47.970" style="s2">done a Delic or I&#39;ve had an experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.830" end="00:34:50.609" style="s2">where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.970" end="00:34:53.099" style="s2">Oh like the ground starts to slip right</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.609" end="00:34:55.830" style="s2">and then I can&#39;t grip onto anything in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.099" end="00:34:59.390" style="s2">that sense of and then there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.830" end="00:35:02.849" style="s2">like a some kind of threshold of where</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.390" end="00:35:04.980" style="s2">it feels like a death of some kind right</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.849" end="00:35:06.780" style="s2">and in dissolving and then the this</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.980" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">recognition that the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.780" end="00:35:12.900" style="s2">the thing I&#39;m expanding into was present</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:15.180" style="s2">the whole time right somehow like and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.900" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">just there was some way I was standing</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.180" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">in relationship to it or identified it</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:24.030" style="s2">had it show itself as that which was</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:27.330" style="s2">horrifying just that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.030" end="00:35:30.450" style="s2">process yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.330" end="00:35:34.290" style="s2">that&#39;s it sounds very similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.450" end="00:35:35.940" style="s2">I&#39;m describing look honey that&#39;s putting</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.290" end="00:35:37.500" style="s2">me I mean obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.940" end="00:35:38.609" style="s2">argumentation and religion and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.500" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">nothingness but religion and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.609" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">nothing--there&#39;s should not be read</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:45.960" style="s2">separate from a deep kind of meditative</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:48.210" style="s2">contemplative practice just like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.960" end="00:35:51.420" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t read the tile thn if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.210" end="00:35:54.119" style="s2">not doing a Chi Chuan here you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.420" end="00:35:59.150" style="s2">deeply not getting it in in a really</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.119" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">important sense yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.150" end="00:36:04.020" style="s2">because I&#39;m interested in which people</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:07.380" style="s2">have these kinds of experiences because</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.020" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">sometimes um the phenomenology is one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.380" end="00:36:14.849" style="s2">like almost like like I said this whoosh</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">and then the other is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.849" end="00:36:21.089" style="s2">my gosh it&#39;s like it&#39;s all it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:22.950" style="s2">directional you know sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.089" end="00:36:26.750" style="s2">withdrawal feels that way but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.950" end="00:36:31.160" style="s2">it feels more like everything is almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.750" end="00:36:31.160" style="s2">holographically everything is opening up</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:40.530" style="s2">almost like sort of you know the tiniest</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.580" end="00:36:42.420" style="s2">describes the one you know all the forms</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.530" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">are reflecting and interpenetrating each</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.420" end="00:36:46.859" style="s2">other but the one is what allows for all</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:48.839" style="s2">the opening up and interpenetration that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.859" end="00:36:53.910" style="s2">is not actually in any one of the forms</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.839" end="00:36:56.130" style="s2">effect did that get that to that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.910" end="00:36:59.900" style="s2">that has actually become more common for</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.130" end="00:37:03.530" style="s2">me than just just the withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.900" end="00:37:08.090" style="s2">right right yeah that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.530" end="00:37:11.900" style="s2">familiar - yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.090" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">so the point I&#39;m get back to it the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.900" end="00:37:16.430" style="s2">point nishitani is making of course is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:18.020" style="s2">of course again you don&#39;t stop doing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.430" end="00:37:20.840" style="s2">argumentation I&#39;m gonna keep saying that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.020" end="00:37:22.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t you create religion and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.840" end="00:37:23.720" style="s2">nothingness but you also do these</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.250" end="00:37:27.080" style="s2">perspectival participatory</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.720" end="00:37:30.860" style="s2">transformations and then there is some</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.080" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">kind of allow me this metaphor this</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.860" end="00:37:36.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a deal logos between them the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">and and the response is in that dialogo</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.530" end="00:37:42.950" style="s2">so it&#39;s not in the text it&#39;s not just in</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:47.090" style="s2">the meditative practice but in the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.950" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">ocean shit exactly like I started I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.090" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">started meditating I went to a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:52.970" style="s2">posture to retreat</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:54.830" style="s2">right and then I think a few months</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.970" end="00:37:59.210" style="s2">after that is when I started reading</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.830" end="00:38:02.300" style="s2">being in time mmm and it I remember that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.210" end="00:38:05.300" style="s2">it after reading being time and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.300" end="00:38:08.690" style="s2">meditating couple hours a day back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.300" end="00:38:11.210" style="s2">forth that it changed my meditation</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.690" end="00:38:14.360" style="s2">right yeah it was a kind of a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.210" end="00:38:16.310" style="s2">which you know like the reverse was also</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.360" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">the case I expect the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.310" end="00:38:19.850" style="s2">afforded you seeing things in being in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:22.310" style="s2">time that you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.850" end="00:38:24.530" style="s2">seen that&#39;s what it we&#39;ve circled back</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.310" end="00:38:27.590" style="s2">around again about trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.530" end="00:38:29.540" style="s2">place of the philosopher rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.590" end="00:38:30.590" style="s2">just gather their propositions and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.540" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.590" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">there&#39;s all these and this is a law this</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:36.020" style="s2">was a lot for a long time in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:38.900" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition that around the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.020" end="00:38:41.630" style="s2">text was a whole ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.900" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">and the text or the discourse and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.630" end="00:38:45.770" style="s2">practices were always in dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:47.480" style="s2">each other yeah and this is what had Oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.770" end="00:38:52.750" style="s2">brought out so beautifully I think this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.480" end="00:38:52.750" style="s2">was one of had those great points yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.530" end="00:38:59.480" style="s2">not to make this too biographical about</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:02.450" style="s2">anyone but Heidegger had circles of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.480" end="00:39:04.850" style="s2">students that he invited over for long</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.450" end="00:39:06.170" style="s2">extended sessions of simply thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.850" end="00:39:08.570" style="s2">sometimes they would collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.170" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">sometimes they they wouldn&#39;t sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.570" end="00:39:15.670" style="s2">they were successful and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">and yeah as you know he worked with my</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.670" end="00:39:24.609" style="s2">dad boss in the 50s to the late 60s who</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:26.589" style="s2">was a Swiss psychiatrist in what was now</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.609" end="00:39:28.109" style="s2">published as the sole econ seminars and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.589" end="00:39:31.240" style="s2">there are still people practicing</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.109" end="00:39:33.400" style="s2">designs analysis or existential therapy</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.240" end="00:39:36.670" style="s2">that came out of that it&#39;s a highly we</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.400" end="00:39:38.859" style="s2">work with psychiatrists for a decade or</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.670" end="00:39:43.329" style="s2">more until he couldn&#39;t anymore longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.859" end="00:39:44.890" style="s2">and that was his way of of you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.329" end="00:39:46.839" style="s2">he provoked them but because they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.890" end="00:39:48.280" style="s2">totally within a Cartesian framework</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.839" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">they were very often out rich but what</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.280" end="00:39:53.109" style="s2">he said then you can&#39;t begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.000" style="s2">ego you have to begin here you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.109" end="00:39:56.890" style="s2">mandalas I mean darkness in the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.000" end="00:39:59.069" style="s2">and it&#39;s being with I was it cetera um</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.890" end="00:40:03.099" style="s2">but he but he never shied away from that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.069" end="00:40:05.710" style="s2">he it was it was about bringing it into</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.099" end="00:40:08.410" style="s2">practice it it wouldn&#39;t have been him to</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.710" end="00:40:10.630" style="s2">do it it would would need someone else</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.410" end="00:40:11.980" style="s2">to do it that was not his role and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.630" end="00:40:15.099" style="s2">was aware of this because for him this</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.980" end="00:40:17.410" style="s2">was ontic this was something that others</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.099" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">would have to do and but he provided the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.410" end="00:40:24.700" style="s2">until ontology for that right his</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.200" end="00:40:28.270" style="s2">thinking and yes it needs practice and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:30.849" style="s2">see with students - I bet that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.270" end="00:40:32.430" style="s2">actually it you know they come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.849" end="00:40:34.539" style="s2">university and they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.430" end="00:40:35.980" style="s2">enthusiastic and after a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.539" end="00:40:39.670" style="s2">they sound like everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.980" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">and rather than still having because of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.670" end="00:40:43.529" style="s2">what I always do it first seminar</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:46.150" style="s2">first-year students</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.529" end="00:40:48.750" style="s2">ancient philosophy why are you here</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.150" end="00:40:51.160" style="s2">that&#39;s my first question</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.750" end="00:40:53.730" style="s2">sometimes again</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.160" end="00:40:57.820" style="s2">it is this relevant for the exam and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.730" end="00:41:05.350" style="s2">some time but sometimes I get my mug</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.820" end="00:41:07.120" style="s2">everything I say will be amazing and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.350" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">bring it I keep bringing it back</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.120" end="00:41:10.300" style="s2">remember back the first lecture why did</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">you come here because usually people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.300" end="00:41:14.950" style="s2">drawn to philosophy for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:16.780" style="s2">reason they&#39;re looking for something um</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.950" end="00:41:19.000" style="s2">what is it that they&#39;re looking for well</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.780" end="00:41:20.770" style="s2">usually they&#39;re looking for meaning why</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.000" end="00:41:23.290" style="s2">are they looking for meaning and why is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.770" end="00:41:25.240" style="s2">it that I mean first of all why is it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.290" end="00:41:27.070" style="s2">that perhaps academic philosophy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.240" end="00:41:31.530" style="s2">really do this or it doesn&#39;t acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.070" end="00:41:34.350" style="s2">it but but second of all what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.530" end="00:41:38.890" style="s2">can be done should be done must be done</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.350" end="00:41:45.130" style="s2">in terms of providing again a space for</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.890" end="00:41:46.660" style="s2">these exercises practices etc yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.130" end="00:41:49.000" style="s2">I think I mentioned this to you last</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.660" end="00:41:51.130" style="s2">time yeah my discussion that I mean guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.000" end="00:41:53.050" style="s2">also notices you know there are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.130" end="00:41:56.440" style="s2">communities of practice that are trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.050" end="00:41:59.470" style="s2">to create set ecologies of practices but</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.440" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">what I often find is that that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.470" end="00:42:08.050" style="s2">from them is is philosophy ah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">a lot of the other stuff around a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.050" end="00:42:11.050" style="s2">the things that we&#39;re talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:13.060" style="s2">this practices and movement practices</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.050" end="00:42:15.780" style="s2">and authentic discourse practices and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.060" end="00:42:17.950" style="s2">narrative practices and all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.780" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">don&#39;t get me wrong I think this is great</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.950" end="00:42:23.290" style="s2">and I and I actively work on to support</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:27.850" style="s2">and facilitate this but what I often</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.290" end="00:42:33.130" style="s2">find missing is the philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.850" end="00:42:36.550" style="s2">what&#39;s it what&#39;s what&#39;s uh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.130" end="00:42:38.320" style="s2">interesting about that right he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.550" end="00:42:42.490" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about like but did you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.320" end="00:42:44.620" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong but the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.490" end="00:42:48.310" style="s2">religion without religion religion</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.620" end="00:42:50.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion that&#39;s my like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.310" end="00:42:53.070" style="s2">don&#39;t get the sense for from its that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:56.170" style="s2">you&#39;re not looking to build a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.070" end="00:42:59.970" style="s2">non-religious church or something found</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.170" end="00:42:59.970" style="s2">a religion I will keep saying that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.500" end="00:43:08.200" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;m wondering about if</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:11.740" style="s2">that bringing the thing that unites all</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.200" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">of these practices the theory the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.740" end="00:43:16.380" style="s2">philosophy awakening because to me this</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:19.869" style="s2">is about like philosophies about</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.380" end="00:43:22.750" style="s2">awakening the Wonder Ray and having that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.869" end="00:43:26.080" style="s2">sense of things and I find with teaching</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.750" end="00:43:30.010" style="s2">people that there is a sense where you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.080" end="00:43:31.180" style="s2">have to awaken it like in a that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.010" end="00:43:34.690" style="s2">called it a wakening from the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.180" end="00:43:37.810" style="s2">crisis it&#39;s it&#39;s because people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.690" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">walking in with an awareness and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.810" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">the idea word philosophy they they will</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:45.970" style="s2">proactively feel that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:48.310" style="s2">assaulting or something to being her</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">head or something like that so one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.310" end="00:43:53.740" style="s2">the things I found is it it&#39;s like and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:57.720" style="s2">think I&#39;ve gotten better as a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.740" end="00:44:01.150" style="s2">over the years in that sense of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.720" end="00:44:04.089" style="s2">the place where you can have them see it</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.150" end="00:44:06.910" style="s2">yes you can see that moment where like</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.089" end="00:44:08.890" style="s2">they see something they experienced</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.910" end="00:44:11.589" style="s2">something that was right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.890" end="00:44:13.869" style="s2">them their whole lives yeah and it never</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.589" end="00:44:15.490" style="s2">there&#39;s all it never been questioned and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.869" end="00:44:18.339" style="s2">it&#39;s a question and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.490" end="00:44:20.200" style="s2">awakening pouria that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.339" end="00:44:23.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what really what Socratic aporia</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.200" end="00:44:25.660" style="s2">is supposed to do yeah yeah YouTube what</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.140" end="00:44:28.660" style="s2">you thought you what was so familiar and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.660" end="00:44:30.910" style="s2">so obvious suddenly is now mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.660" end="00:44:33.390" style="s2">team in a profound way I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.910" end="00:44:36.369" style="s2">whole point of Socratic aporia I agree i</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.390" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s why you&#39;re honest</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.369" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">picked up on it that&#39;s why I try to make</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:43.420" style="s2">a distinction between philosophy which i</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:47.050" style="s2">think is still important by the way but</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.420" end="00:44:50.950" style="s2">and philosophy a-- which i think is is</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.050" end="00:44:52.930" style="s2">something more that i&#39;m not i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.950" end="00:44:55.869" style="s2">i&#39;m neutral on whether or not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.930" end="00:44:58.330" style="s2">needs to do philosophy but i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.869" end="00:45:01.089" style="s2">everybody needs to practice and live</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.330" end="00:45:08.890" style="s2">philosophy a-- in a profound way and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.089" end="00:45:11.980" style="s2">I think those are yeah because I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.890" end="00:45:16.060" style="s2">want I want to pick up on that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.980" end="00:45:17.590" style="s2">point you were making about you know you</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.060" end="00:45:20.500" style="s2">you can bring Pete</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.590" end="00:45:22.300" style="s2">to that point where they get well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.500" end="00:45:25.150" style="s2">to use our metaphor you get you get a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.300" end="00:45:27.580" style="s2">crack in the wall yeah opening right</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.150" end="00:45:28.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like the Leonard Cohen lied well</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.580" end="00:45:30.190" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.810" end="00:45:32.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a crack and everything and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.190" end="00:45:33.340" style="s2">that&#39;s how the light shines through all</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.230" end="00:45:37.690" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.340" end="00:45:40.660" style="s2">really yeah I think everybody because of</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.690" end="00:45:42.070" style="s2">what we&#39;re in and where we are I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.660" end="00:45:44.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why everybody ultimately needs</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.070" end="00:45:47.530" style="s2">philosophy a-- so well I deeply applaud</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.920" end="00:45:49.570" style="s2">and I really and I put time and effort</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.530" end="00:45:53.470" style="s2">and talent into these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.570" end="00:45:56.830" style="s2">communities I think there is still right</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.470" end="00:45:58.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to get philosophy ax into them</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.830" end="00:46:00.340" style="s2">in some way that&#39;s why this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.780" end="00:46:01.870" style="s2">is very important by the way that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.340" end="00:46:03.130" style="s2">of the reasons I mean other than really</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.870" end="00:46:05.260" style="s2">liking you guys and enjoying the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:07.420" style="s2">conversation what I mean in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.260" end="00:46:09.070" style="s2">conversation is precisely because I want</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.420" end="00:46:11.980" style="s2">I think it&#39;s trying to do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.070" end="00:46:15.010" style="s2">trying to bring philosophy ax into this</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.980" end="00:46:19.360" style="s2">attempt to get these Ecology&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.010" end="00:46:22.810" style="s2">practices going right on this point of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.360" end="00:46:26.500" style="s2">philosophy a perhaps also some other</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.810" end="00:46:31.240" style="s2">point will have to carve out what that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.500" end="00:46:33.760" style="s2">is and what that means and you might</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.240" end="00:46:35.800" style="s2">disagree with this totally both of you I</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:37.870" style="s2">don&#39;t know but what are the dangers I</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.800" end="00:46:41.980" style="s2">see in Hegel speaks of this I think in</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.870" end="00:46:44.140" style="s2">the difference shift what he says it</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.980" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">would be absurd to call oneself a plate</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.140" end="00:46:49.570" style="s2">in this today and and what I think what</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:52.780" style="s2">he means by this is that you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.570" end="00:46:54.970" style="s2">just pick and choose no no you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.780" end="00:46:57.130" style="s2">just go back and say well I&#39;m an heiress</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.970" end="00:46:58.780" style="s2">I&#39;m a new in New York soon I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.130" end="00:47:01.990" style="s2">Aristotelian I&#39;m a played tennis and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.780" end="00:47:04.150" style="s2">stoic I&#39;m this and that as if from a</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.990" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">metaphysical supermarket because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.150" end="00:47:08.800" style="s2">very easy to do right I&#39;m gonna be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:11.290" style="s2">of a Buddhist over here I&#39;m gonna but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:15.610" style="s2">what does it mean that that we have this</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.290" end="00:47:17.560" style="s2">this rich source or origin but also this</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.610" end="00:47:19.810" style="s2">miss this burden of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.560" end="00:47:25.600" style="s2">knowledge because it philosophy is also</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.810" end="00:47:27.880" style="s2">extremely abstract and and and well it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.600" end="00:47:31.090" style="s2">also is a burden to have access to all</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.880" end="00:47:33.400" style="s2">of that potential knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.090" end="00:47:35.290" style="s2">the question is so if you use the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.400" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">philosophy a to some degree that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.290" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">going back to the Greek word of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:43.750" style="s2">that&#39;s the it won&#39;t feel but how for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:47.320" style="s2">I think it would be extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.750" end="00:47:51.100" style="s2">to to not be some isn&#39;t some part from</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.320" end="00:47:53.950" style="s2">this isn&#39;t something uniquely off this</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.100" end="00:47:56.050" style="s2">ebook right uniquely off this age that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.950" end="00:47:59.020" style="s2">speaks to this age but then that takes</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.050" end="00:48:02.200" style="s2">of course direction and and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.020" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">reinvasion from the wisdom of what has</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.200" end="00:48:08.680" style="s2">been but but doesn&#39;t sort of mix it up</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:11.740" style="s2">too much do you see what I mean it sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.680" end="00:48:13.240" style="s2">of it&#39;s it&#39;s generating itself out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.740" end="00:48:16.570" style="s2">that which has been but in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.240" end="00:48:21.100" style="s2">that responds to us but to us</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.570" end="00:48:22.930" style="s2">specifically today in our yeah I totally</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.100" end="00:48:24.280" style="s2">agree with that that&#39;s why I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.930" end="00:48:27.700" style="s2">how to articulate it I&#39;ve been tracking</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.280" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">I talked about salvaging which is my way</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.700" end="00:48:31.960" style="s2">of trying to like you know you&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:33.910" style="s2">of diving into the depths and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.960" end="00:48:37.240" style="s2">bringing up what was valuable and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.910" end="00:48:39.010" style="s2">trying to refurbish it and it&#39;s a poor</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.240" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">matter for me I need a better one</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.010" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:43.210" style="s2">to say when I say the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:46.300" style="s2">not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.210" end="00:48:48.430" style="s2">the reason why I think even for even</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.300" end="00:48:50.830" style="s2">though I find Plato sacred and till</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.430" end="00:48:53.110" style="s2">tiniest is sacred for me too I you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.830" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">I&#39;m not a neoplatonist in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.110" end="00:49:00.070" style="s2">I can&#39;t the the actual age two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:03.850" style="s2">mythos is not viable for me it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.850" end="00:49:16.150" style="s2">but exactly what you said yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.510" end="00:49:17.290" style="s2">open to this I want exactly I think what</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.150" end="00:49:18.370" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.290" end="00:49:20.200" style="s2">trying to put my finger on with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.370" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion yes and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.200" end="00:49:25.900" style="s2">upon the sacredness but it yes for now</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:28.270" style="s2">okay good not now I get oh I think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.900" end="00:49:31.720" style="s2">understand that name better because it</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.270" end="00:49:34.090" style="s2">reminded me of Heidegger&#39;s unnamed gods</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.720" end="00:49:36.100" style="s2">yeah he doesn&#39;t name them because he</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.090" end="00:49:38.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to give us oh look you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.100" end="00:49:40.030" style="s2">should believe in Susan Hera</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.200" end="00:49:42.420" style="s2">no we can&#39;t go back to Greek mythology</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.030" end="00:49:44.220" style="s2">that would be a bit ridiculous so</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.420" end="00:49:46.140" style="s2">they&#39;re unnamed for now because this</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.220" end="00:49:49.980" style="s2">unfortunately or fortunately who knows</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.140" end="00:49:51.839" style="s2">is a an epoch where gods have</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.980" end="00:49:54.359" style="s2">disappeared where the godly is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.839" end="00:49:55.890" style="s2">disappearing withdrawing but what we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.359" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">still say that there is a flickering</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.890" end="00:50:00.270" style="s2">some lingering some some gloom of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:02.910" style="s2">so there some something that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.270" end="00:50:05.730" style="s2">there that&#39;s still an echo of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.910" end="00:50:08.010" style="s2">but we can&#39;t name it we shouldn&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.730" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">it because if because what I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.010" end="00:50:14.849" style="s2">about isms is that they are already</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:18.210" style="s2">there already ossified but it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.849" end="00:50:21.809" style="s2">I mean this isn&#39;t and that&#39;s it so this</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.210" end="00:50:23.520" style="s2">is what I this is no but if we because</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.809" end="00:50:26.069" style="s2">OMA that&#39;s almost again subjective is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.520" end="00:50:27.869" style="s2">just asserting itself right I&#39;m I&#39;m this</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.069" end="00:50:29.190" style="s2">ISM and therefore everything&#39;s fine and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.869" end="00:50:30.510" style="s2">I have to worry about it no then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.190" end="00:50:33.720" style="s2">not the age we live and we live in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.510" end="00:50:36.630" style="s2">age of four nothing makes sense to some</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.720" end="00:50:39.720" style="s2">degree but this is the tide is already</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:41.609" style="s2">coming back there is that it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.720" end="00:50:44.430" style="s2">have Nietzsche speaks of the healthy own</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.609" end="00:50:50.430" style="s2">tone right of the tone of the hell&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.430" end="00:50:53.640" style="s2">bird which already here&#39;s the so it the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.430" end="00:50:56.609" style="s2">halcyon bird breeds during to two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.640" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">off a couple of weeks when when the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.609" end="00:51:04.740" style="s2">ocean is still and and knows that</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:09.240" style="s2">tempest will come again and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.740" end="00:51:13.799" style="s2">prepared for the horror terror that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.240" end="00:51:15.420" style="s2">about to come but it&#39;s so it but it but</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.799" end="00:51:16.530" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t sort of what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.420" end="00:51:17.940" style="s2">say is this this way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.530" end="00:51:21.059" style="s2">feelings of fear is a good name for it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.940" end="00:51:25.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s also quite open right but</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.059" end="00:51:28.109" style="s2">if we if we stifle it with isms then we</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.260" end="00:51:29.910" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like we what happened is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.109" end="00:51:34.049" style="s2">can produce a consumer product</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.910" end="00:51:35.460" style="s2">right exactly exactly I mean and and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.049" end="00:51:36.270" style="s2">part of it I think is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.460" end="00:51:40.020" style="s2">bi-directional</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.270" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">critique which the one we&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.020" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">voice to now is to try to try to try to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:48.809" style="s2">resolve this through nostalgia and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:52.020" style="s2">that&#39;s yet that&#39;s a deep mistake I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.809" end="00:51:55.800" style="s2">also trying to resolve this through a</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.020" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">utopia which has a completed picture</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.800" end="00:52:02.310" style="s2">of the future is also a deep mistake I</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:04.500" style="s2">think these things are not the proper</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.310" end="00:52:08.460" style="s2">framing that we need for what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.500" end="00:52:10.260" style="s2">calling philosophy oh well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.460" end="00:52:14.370" style="s2">work and that needs to be done right</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.260" end="00:52:15.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the whatnot sort of framing all</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.370" end="00:52:19.980" style="s2">of Phaedo Sofia</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.360" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">but bringing while giving birth to Fela</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.980" end="00:52:26.610" style="s2">Sofia yes it&#39;s more about exemplifying</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:28.560" style="s2">and participating in it yeah again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.610" end="00:52:31.580" style="s2">gonna I&#39;m gonna be oh I will of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.560" end="00:52:38.760" style="s2">theorize it because that&#39;s also yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.580" end="00:52:40.620" style="s2">Robin my work step on it and then but</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.760" end="00:52:46.830" style="s2">you know it&#39;s really interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.620" end="00:52:51.540" style="s2">hard it is I mean I you know it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.830" end="00:52:54.180" style="s2">sort of easy for us but it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.540" end="00:52:55.770" style="s2">people because often if you say you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.180" end="00:52:59.130" style="s2">give up nostalgia they go oh yes I get</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.770" end="00:53:00.750" style="s2">that utopia or if you say to people no</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.130" end="00:53:03.090" style="s2">no not utopia and they go oh yes I get</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.750" end="00:53:05.670" style="s2">that nostalgia right and it&#39;s oh no no</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.090" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">no the the grammar that&#39;s generating</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.670" end="00:53:09.600" style="s2">both of those is when I ask you to step</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:13.380" style="s2">beyond and then that&#39;s when there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.600" end="00:53:16.560" style="s2">glimmer of horror in their eyes all</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.380" end="00:53:20.280" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.560" end="00:53:21.240" style="s2">requires deep respect of the person</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.280" end="00:53:24.180" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.240" end="00:53:28.380" style="s2">deep sensitivity and a willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.180" end="00:53:30.090" style="s2">linger and be patient with them and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.380" end="00:53:31.950" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that came off as condescending</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.090" end="00:53:32.400" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t mean it to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.950" end="00:53:36.900" style="s2">strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.400" end="00:53:38.340" style="s2">I meant it to be caring yeah I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.900" end="00:53:40.320" style="s2">have to go soon guys we&#39;ve been talking</p>
