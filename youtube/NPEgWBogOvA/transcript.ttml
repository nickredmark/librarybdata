<p begin="00:01:22.840" end="00:01:26.409" style="s2">first off Jim you didn&#39;t mention this</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.340" end="00:01:28.030" style="s2">but of course I took over I filled your</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.409" end="00:01:31.090" style="s2">very big shoes as chairman of the board</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.030" end="00:01:33.400" style="s2">and you know it is an institute that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.090" end="00:01:35.110" style="s2">founded about 35 years ago by a number</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.400" end="00:01:36.820" style="s2">of scientists who felt that academia had</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.110" end="00:01:38.409" style="s2">become too siloed and that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.820" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">vexing important issues in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.409" end="00:01:42.220" style="s2">stood at the intersection of disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:44.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s a non-degree conferring</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.220" end="00:01:47.140" style="s2">institute that works on basic research</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.080" end="00:01:49.090" style="s2">questions across disciplines and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.140" end="00:01:51.460" style="s2">unifying theme if there is one is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.090" end="00:01:53.170" style="s2">complex system so interactions of lots</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.460" end="00:01:55.330" style="s2">of little agents and what emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.170" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">that and how those things evolve over</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.330" end="00:02:00.100" style="s2">time you know my introduction to SFI was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.710" style="s2">through bill Miller and it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.100" end="00:02:04.990" style="s2">one of these very specific moments I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.710" end="00:02:06.549" style="s2">recall we were at a baseball game and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.990" end="00:02:08.590" style="s2">had a beer in one hand and a hotdog in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.549" end="00:02:10.030" style="s2">another and Bill said you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.590" end="00:02:12.069" style="s2">this place out of New Mexico you ought</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.030" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">to check out I was I was a financial</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.069" end="00:02:17.379" style="s2">analyst and I was reading a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:19.510" style="s2">and in science and biology evolution all</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.379" end="00:02:21.579" style="s2">this kind of stuff and so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.510" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">encouraged me to go out there probably a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.579" end="00:02:26.349" style="s2">little over close to 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.450" style="s2">and I was immediately enthralled just</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.349" end="00:02:30.939" style="s2">some of the presentations the way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:32.829" style="s2">thinking and I think for me one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.939" end="00:02:35.140" style="s2">most extraordinary values of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.829" end="00:02:37.930" style="s2">Institute is just the fact that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.140" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">lot of it draws people who are actively</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.930" end="00:02:43.659" style="s2">open-minded Oh intellectually curious</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:46.870" style="s2">people so yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a neat place</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.659" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">and I think often people in the business</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.870" end="00:02:50.739" style="s2">world or finance world feel like some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:53.049" style="s2">the ideas or themes are not that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.739" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">applicable to business or investing but</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.049" end="00:02:55.629" style="s2">if you hang around a little bit and have</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:57.159" style="s2">an open mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.629" end="00:02:59.799" style="s2">they&#39;re just enormous number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.159" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">connections between all the business in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.799" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">the world of investing and the study of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.720" end="00:03:06.099" style="s2">complex systems so it&#39;s not only been</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">personally very gratifying and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.099" end="00:03:09.970" style="s2">source of great growth but also</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">professionally actually really</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.970" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">interesting and valuable yeah indeed I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:16.269" style="s2">should say it&#39;s been an unfair weapon</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">for me ever since I got involved in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.269" end="00:03:18.849" style="s2">you know to the point of applicability</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.500" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">one of the points I like to make to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.849" end="00:03:24.459" style="s2">people is that yes sometimes the actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:26.889" style="s2">science hard core may be a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.459" end="00:03:28.989" style="s2">difficult to apply but the metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.889" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">that come out of it are unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.989" end="00:03:34.750" style="s2">things like you know Fitness landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:36.099" style="s2">increasing returns the scale etc that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.750" end="00:03:37.510" style="s2">are somewhat different than the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.099" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">conventional way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.510" end="00:03:41.650" style="s2">are extraordinarily powerful lenses for</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">thinking about both business and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.650" end="00:03:45.069" style="s2">investing I agree with that a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:46.780" style="s2">percent and the way I think about not</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.069" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">not just in business or investing but</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.780" end="00:03:51.730" style="s2">just life is that it&#39;s really good to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:53.319" style="s2">try to build a toolbox of tools so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.730" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">when you face a problem you have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.319" end="00:03:56.949" style="s2">right tool in this case perhaps picking</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:58.599" style="s2">up on what you said a metaphor to try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.949" end="00:04:00.579" style="s2">solve that or think about it effectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.599" end="00:04:02.590" style="s2">and so I think one of the joys of life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.579" end="00:04:04.209" style="s2">although it&#39;s a bit of work is its to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.590" end="00:04:05.769" style="s2">constantly working on your toolbox and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.209" end="00:04:08.199" style="s2">thinking about different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.769" end="00:04:10.389" style="s2">approaching problems and I would just</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.199" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">say that associating with s Fi and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.389" end="00:04:15.579" style="s2">folks there is just a great way to help</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:17.229" style="s2">build out that toolbox and again very</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.579" end="00:04:19.449" style="s2">intellectually fulfilling but but</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.229" end="00:04:21.639" style="s2">actually very practical as well indeed</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.449" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">now before we hop into talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.639" end="00:04:24.940" style="s2">your book at all I&#39;m sure our audience</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:28.360" style="s2">would also appreciate a little insight</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.940" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">into your day job as a value investor in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.360" end="00:04:33.100" style="s2">prepping for the podcast I happened upon</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">a really interesting document your room</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.100" end="00:04:38.530" style="s2">titled who is on the other side it&#39;s 51</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2">pages and we&#39;ll put a link to it up on</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.530" end="00:04:42.660" style="s2">the website and it&#39;s well worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.300" end="00:04:44.770" style="s2">I thought that was just an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.660" end="00:04:46.600" style="s2">perspective on investing because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.770" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">condense your perspective down to a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.600" end="00:04:50.290" style="s2">minutes yeah sure I mean and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:52.690" style="s2">and I also teach at Columbia Business</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">School as an adjunct so I&#39;m a pretend</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.690" end="00:04:56.170" style="s2">professor but it&#39;s been great and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.910" end="00:04:57.970" style="s2">teach the course in a number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.170" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">different modules one of the modules is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.970" end="00:05:02.470" style="s2">thinking about why to markets mispriced</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:03.790" style="s2">securities and this is something over</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.470" end="00:05:05.770" style="s2">the years Jim that I typically</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.790" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">pontificate about but really had done</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.770" end="00:05:09.550" style="s2">very little to codify my thinking so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:11.170" style="s2">like all right after all these years</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.550" end="00:05:12.910" style="s2">maybe I should sit down and actually get</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.170" end="00:05:15.070" style="s2">serious about this and try to quantify</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.910" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">this the title I saw from another</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.070" end="00:05:18.790" style="s2">presentation who&#39;s on the other side but</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:20.260" style="s2">you know this is also if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.790" end="00:05:21.940" style="s2">you&#39;re a poker player which I know that</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.940" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re up against somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.070" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">you want to think about what does that</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">world it&#39;s very much true for investing</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.340" end="00:05:33.070" style="s2">when you put on a trade you buy or sell</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.690" end="00:05:35.170" style="s2">something the question you should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.070" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">asking yourself is what do I know or</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.170" end="00:05:38.260" style="s2">where I think I know that this person</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:39.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and why they motivate to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.260" end="00:05:42.310" style="s2">something on the opposite side of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.700" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">trade so when I try to try to break this</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.310" end="00:05:45.370" style="s2">down there are four potential areas of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:48.340" style="s2">mispricing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.370" end="00:05:49.900" style="s2">the first is you know we call it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.340" end="00:05:52.990" style="s2">behavioural but that you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.900" end="00:05:55.210" style="s2">were social beings and and investing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.990" end="00:05:56.770" style="s2">inherently a social exercise and from</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.210" end="00:05:59.290" style="s2">time to time we sort of correlate our</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.770" end="00:06:01.630" style="s2">behaviors and lead to sort of excesses</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.290" end="00:06:03.610" style="s2">and markets or the theme of over</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.630" end="00:06:04.870" style="s2">extrapolation so behavioral that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.610" end="00:06:06.190" style="s2">there are a lot of other subsets but</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.870" end="00:06:07.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a big one the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.190" end="00:06:10.090" style="s2">analytical so you and I have the SAC</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.720" end="00:06:11.290" style="s2">same information but we analyze it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.090" end="00:06:12.790" style="s2">different ways or come to different</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.290" end="00:06:15.100" style="s2">conclusions you can imagine how that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.790" end="00:06:16.780" style="s2">would work as well the third one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.100" end="00:06:18.130" style="s2">informational which is the most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.780" end="00:06:19.180" style="s2">is that you know something that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.130" end="00:06:21.640" style="s2">know or vice-versa</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.180" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">of course governments around the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.640" end="00:06:26.020" style="s2">that try to encourage companies to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:27.490" style="s2">disclose information uniformly and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.020" end="00:06:30.100" style="s2">low-cost as possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.490" end="00:06:31.870" style="s2">to sort of get rid of that advantage but</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.100" end="00:06:33.760" style="s2">there certainly have to be informational</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.870" end="00:06:35.260" style="s2">advantages as well and and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.760" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">even part of that is there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.260" end="00:06:38.890" style="s2">literature on what we pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:40.570" style="s2">so it&#39;s not so much the information is</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.890" end="00:06:42.640" style="s2">not out there we just don&#39;t wait it all</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.570" end="00:06:44.510" style="s2">the same way and then the final one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.640" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">technical which is some</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.510" end="00:06:47.150" style="s2">people have to buy or sell for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:48.830" style="s2">that have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.150" end="00:06:50.990" style="s2">fundamentals you know you have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.830" end="00:06:52.580" style="s2">your kids college tuition you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.990" end="00:06:54.290" style="s2">sell just because you need to raise the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.580" end="00:06:55.790" style="s2">cash to pay the tuition and has nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.290" end="00:06:58.100" style="s2">to do or there&#39;s no statement about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.790" end="00:06:59.600" style="s2">values at all so I just try to create</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.100" end="00:07:01.730" style="s2">this sort of comprehensive framework and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.600" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">say every time you put on a trade and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.730" end="00:07:05.180" style="s2">you think you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.620" style="s2">generate an excess return just give some</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.180" end="00:07:08.690" style="s2">thought as to who&#39;s on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.620" end="00:07:10.910" style="s2">that and why you think specifically you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.690" end="00:07:12.020" style="s2">have some sort of an edge and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.910" end="00:07:14.750" style="s2">just think it&#39;s a really rich way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.020" end="00:07:17.000" style="s2">think about things versus just think in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.750" end="00:07:19.040" style="s2">your head you&#39;re the most clever person</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.000" end="00:07:20.510" style="s2">walking around it and if you&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.040" end="00:07:23.420" style="s2">markets by the way for any period of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.510" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">time and you&#39;re not humble about it then</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.420" end="00:07:26.780" style="s2">then something&#39;s wrong I mean markets</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:29.240" style="s2">are the most humbling mechanism I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.780" end="00:07:32.630" style="s2">imagine yeah I can tell you the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:35.060" style="s2">experience over my 35 years or so and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.630" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">you know and you know to your point you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.060" end="00:07:38.750" style="s2">know nothing drives me crazy er than</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:40.910" style="s2">hearing two morons at a restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.750" end="00:07:45.100" style="s2">discussing the tip they got from their</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.910" end="00:07:47.660" style="s2">broker as if this was God&#39;s own truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.100" end="00:07:49.130" style="s2">exactly you&#39;re human so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.660" end="00:07:52.460" style="s2">entertaining right so we love stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.130" end="00:07:54.440" style="s2">and and we&#39;d love to defer to experts</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.460" end="00:07:56.840" style="s2">we&#39;d love to defer to people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.440" end="00:07:58.190" style="s2">quotes in the know but yeah we can just</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:07:58.670" style="s2">know in real life that doesn&#39;t work out</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.190" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">so well</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.670" end="00:08:02.330" style="s2">yeah in fact we&#39;ll finish this section</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:04.100" style="s2">by a quote that you had in the paper</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.330" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">from I guess is your hero Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.100" end="00:08:08.510" style="s2">Graham he said have the courage of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:10.310" style="s2">knowledge and experience if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.510" end="00:08:13.310" style="s2">formed a conclusion from the facts that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.310" end="00:08:15.050" style="s2">if he know your judgment is sound act on</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.310" end="00:08:17.210" style="s2">it even though others may hesitate or</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.050" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">differ you are neither right nor wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.210" end="00:08:21.050" style="s2">because the crowd disagrees with you you</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:23.600" style="s2">are right because your data and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:25.070" style="s2">reasoning are right beautiful right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.600" end="00:08:26.600" style="s2">you know it&#39;s interesting that it the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.070" end="00:08:28.760" style="s2">course that I teach at Columbia Business</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.600" end="00:08:30.710" style="s2">School is actually sort of the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.760" end="00:08:33.229" style="s2">course at Ben Graham started teaching in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.710" end="00:08:35.210" style="s2">the 1920s so it&#39;s been around and at</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.229" end="00:08:38.120" style="s2">Columbia for many many years and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.210" end="00:08:40.729" style="s2">that you know if you read Graham&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.120" end="00:08:41.750" style="s2">you know security analysis from 1934 in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.729" end="00:08:44.030" style="s2">the intelligent investor</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.750" end="00:08:45.890" style="s2">it&#39;s replete with examples that were at</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.030" end="00:08:48.110" style="s2">the time contemporary but they feel very</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.890" end="00:08:50.150" style="s2">dated and so and a lot of his methods</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.110" end="00:08:52.700" style="s2">actually today and I think come across</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.150" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">as very dated but Graham&#39;s overarching</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.700" end="00:08:56.210" style="s2">lesson to all of us is really about</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.470" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">temperament and philosophy of how you</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.210" end="00:08:59.249" style="s2">approach in bed</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:01.379" style="s2">in general and that quote I think really</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.249" end="00:09:03.209" style="s2">embodies something that will ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.379" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">be timeless right which is people may go</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.209" end="00:09:06.509" style="s2">bonkers but when the facts and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:08.970" style="s2">done the work and the facts in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.509" end="00:09:10.199" style="s2">judgement align to suggest you should do</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.970" end="00:09:12.209" style="s2">something you should just go ahead with</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.199" end="00:09:15.329" style="s2">with some conviction so a lot of that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.209" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">the thing the lasting lesson of Ben</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.329" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">Graham is really about temperament and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:23.129" style="s2">how you approach this philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:25.050" style="s2">and that is that&#39;s a powerful thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.129" end="00:09:26.790" style="s2">we will talk about another 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.050" end="00:09:28.319" style="s2">from now I think and we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.790" end="00:09:31.350" style="s2">things related to it as we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.319" end="00:09:33.449" style="s2">your book so now let&#39;s turn to the 6x</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.350" end="00:09:35.910" style="s2">Equation untangling skill and locked-in</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.449" end="00:09:37.170" style="s2">business sports and investing I knew</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.910" end="00:09:39.389" style="s2">this is going to be interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.170" end="00:09:41.309" style="s2">right up front I saw that you had said</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.389" end="00:09:43.319" style="s2">if you are the underdog you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.309" end="00:09:46.499" style="s2">inject luck by making the game more</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.319" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">complex this is the rule I&#39;ve long found</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.499" end="00:09:50.639" style="s2">useful but yet does not seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.850" style="s2">something that most people intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.639" end="00:09:55.829" style="s2">know for example chess I&#39;m a mediocre</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.850" end="00:09:58.889" style="s2">real world chess player but a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.829" end="00:10:01.079" style="s2">decent barroom chess player and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.889" end="00:10:03.179" style="s2">because I when I discover my opponent is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.079" end="00:10:05.999" style="s2">better than me which is fairly often</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.179" end="00:10:08.309" style="s2">I just relentlessly raise the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.999" end="00:10:10.559" style="s2">of the middle game and most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.309" end="00:10:12.089" style="s2">take that strategy I&#39;ve got some other</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.559" end="00:10:14.579" style="s2">examples from business but why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.089" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">tell us your perspective on that make</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.579" end="00:10:18.179" style="s2">the game more complex when you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:20.189" style="s2">underdog yeah I mean that&#39;s awesome Jim</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.179" end="00:10:22.499" style="s2">and I&#39;ll just say let me make this a</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.279" end="00:10:53.370" style="s2">about game theory everyone&#39;s heard of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.689" end="00:10:55.199" style="s2">the prisoner&#39;s dilemma almost no one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.050" end="00:11:04.529" style="s2">Robertson came along and mathematize the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.569" style="s2">Colonel blotto game so let me describe</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.529" end="00:11:07.649" style="s2">what as so he developed this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.569" end="00:11:08.209" style="s2">sort of where that would this let this</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.649" end="00:11:10.009" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.209" end="00:11:13.160" style="s2">so let me just drive the Colonel blotto</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.009" end="00:11:15.199" style="s2">game very simply the setup is you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.160" end="00:11:16.910" style="s2">you allocate two parties in number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.199" end="00:11:18.439" style="s2">soldiers so Jim and I you&#39;ll not play so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.910" end="00:11:20.269" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a hundred soldiers and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.439" end="00:11:22.369" style="s2">I&#39;ll have a hundred soldiers and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.269" end="00:11:23.779" style="s2">we&#39;ll have three we specify number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.369" end="00:11:25.399" style="s2">battlefield so it&#39;s called three</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.779" end="00:11:28.490" style="s2">battlefields to start in the initial</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.399" end="00:11:30.889" style="s2">condition and so what we do again we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.490" end="00:11:32.869" style="s2">this independently in in blindly is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.889" end="00:11:34.850" style="s2">allocate soldiers to each battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.869" end="00:11:36.529" style="s2">then we sort of lift the veil and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.850" end="00:11:38.569" style="s2">whoever has the most soldiers per</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.529" end="00:11:40.249" style="s2">battlefield wins that battle and whoever</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.569" end="00:11:41.540" style="s2">wins the most battles wins the war right</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.249" end="00:11:43.369" style="s2">so that&#39;s the basic setup and the way I</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.540" end="00:11:45.079" style="s2">just described 100 soldiers hundred</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.369" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">soldiers three battlefields that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.079" end="00:11:48.829" style="s2">basically rock-paper-scissors right</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:50.660" style="s2">there are some dumb strategies but but</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.829" end="00:11:53.119" style="s2">most strategies it&#39;s just going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.660" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">cycle sort of cycle win-loss so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.119" end="00:11:56.990" style="s2">the basic setup but where Colonel blotto</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.860" end="00:11:58.759" style="s2">gets really interesting is when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.990" end="00:12:00.139" style="s2">change when you have asymmetry in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.759" end="00:12:01.579" style="s2">number soldiers so now I give you a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.139" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">hundred and fifty soldiers I have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.579" end="00:12:05.269" style="s2">hundred there&#39;s still ways for me to win</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:07.009" style="s2">but obviously many fewer and then the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.269" end="00:12:09.410" style="s2">second thing is to expand the number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.009" end="00:12:11.149" style="s2">battlefields and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.410" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2">Robertson&#39;s stuff got really really</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.149" end="00:12:16.249" style="s2">interesting because it turns out that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:18.290" style="s2">an asymmetric battle the way you dilute</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.249" end="00:12:19.910" style="s2">the strength of the stronger player is</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.290" end="00:12:22.429" style="s2">to increase the number of battlefields</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.910" end="00:12:24.049" style="s2">or ie to add complexity to it right as</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.429" end="00:12:25.790" style="s2">you as you sort of let me add luck but</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.049" end="00:12:27.829" style="s2">just add complexity as you mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.790" end="00:12:30.139" style="s2">the middle game in chess and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.829" end="00:12:32.629" style="s2">this really fascinating idea that when</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.139" end="00:12:34.490" style="s2">you&#39;re the stronger player what you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.629" end="00:12:36.949" style="s2">to do is simplify the game right because</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.490" end="00:12:38.869" style="s2">then your skill or your strength will</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.949" end="00:12:41.029" style="s2">overwhelm your competitor and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.869" end="00:12:43.399" style="s2">the underdog you want to come make the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.029" end="00:12:45.079" style="s2">game more complex now in the business</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.399" end="00:12:46.910" style="s2">world we would talk about things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.079" end="00:12:48.679" style="s2">disruptive innovation the work by clay</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.910" end="00:12:51.499" style="s2">Christensen a disruptive innovation sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.679" end="00:12:53.779" style="s2">of a classic approach to sort of taking</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.499" end="00:12:55.850" style="s2">a weird approach to trying to compete</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.779" end="00:12:57.439" style="s2">not going toe-to-toe with the incumbent</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:13:00.049" style="s2">but rather sort of competing on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.439" end="00:13:01.459" style="s2">edges again making the income and do</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.049" end="00:13:03.529" style="s2">something they&#39;re not comfortable doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.459" end="00:13:06.799" style="s2">or they are not interested in doing or</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.529" end="00:13:08.329" style="s2">they&#39;re not incentivized to doing okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.799" end="00:13:10.100" style="s2">Jim can I also mention something weird</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.329" end="00:13:11.559" style="s2">that I think you&#39;re gonna really like by</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.100" end="00:13:14.839" style="s2">the way I have at it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.559" end="00:13:16.129" style="s2">others I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.839" end="00:13:17.910" style="s2">this directly but there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.129" end="00:13:20.340" style="s2">interesting book by Roy boom</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.910" end="00:13:22.950" style="s2">called is there anything good about men</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.340" end="00:13:25.380" style="s2">do you know this book do not okay this</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.950" end="00:13:27.180" style="s2">is gonna be up your alley and so beau</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.380" end="00:13:28.710" style="s2">Meister starts with us you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.180" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">this thing about by the way is there</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.710" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">anything good about men people often</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:33.240" style="s2">joke it&#39;s gonna be a pretty short short</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.680" style="s2">book but but as actually his point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.240" end="00:13:35.970" style="s2">they&#39;re actually he&#39;s just you know men</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.680" end="00:13:37.710" style="s2">and women are different for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.970" end="00:13:38.820" style="s2">interesting reasons but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.710" end="00:13:40.830" style="s2">chapter in there this particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.820" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">interest in when he talks about what so</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.830" end="00:13:45.630" style="s2">one of the observations we know just in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:47.850" style="s2">life is that men and women in most</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.630" end="00:13:50.130" style="s2">things the averages are about the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.850" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">right and this aside personality stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.130" end="00:13:54.210" style="s2">and cognitive stuff and so forth but we</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:56.310" style="s2">also know that by from many many things</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.210" end="00:13:58.200" style="s2">the variance of men is higher than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.310" end="00:14:00.210" style="s2">variance of women right so there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.200" end="00:14:01.950" style="s2">more men on the right tail and more men</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.210" end="00:14:02.550" style="s2">in the left tail even if the average is</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.950" end="00:14:04.230" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.550" end="00:14:06.540" style="s2">yeah but the comprehensive social</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.230" end="00:14:08.700" style="s2">science result pretty much correct and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.540" end="00:14:12.030" style="s2">so beau Meister asked to sort a question</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.700" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">like why is that that&#39;s not a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.030" end="00:14:15.690" style="s2">weird thing so one of his chapters he</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.250" end="00:14:17.400" style="s2">opens and he says let me ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.690" end="00:14:19.380" style="s2">really simple question if you think back</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.400" end="00:14:21.980" style="s2">to all of our ancestors what percent</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.380" end="00:14:24.300" style="s2">were women and what percent were men and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.980" end="00:14:25.770" style="s2">your intuitive answer is well everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">has a mother and a father so it should</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.770" end="00:14:29.130" style="s2">be 50/50 and if you you know where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">going with this the answer is that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.130" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">at all the case and this is based on</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:34.620" style="s2">genetics and no one really knows the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:36.510" style="s2">exact number but the ratios something</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.620" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">like two-to-one women to men so in other</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.510" end="00:14:40.500" style="s2">words and let&#39;s just call it two thirds</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:42.810" style="s2">of all ancestors or women and one-third</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.500" end="00:14:44.820" style="s2">of ancestors or men so saying this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.810" end="00:14:46.950" style="s2">differently in the sweep of human</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.820" end="00:14:48.510" style="s2">history and by the way don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.950" end="00:14:50.940" style="s2">just humans look at any other primates</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.510" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">or any other mammals in general it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.940" end="00:14:55.470" style="s2">case that women have a roughly twice the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:14:58.500" style="s2">probability of reproducing than men do</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.470" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">so for the vast part of human history</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.500" end="00:15:05.610" style="s2">most men were reproductive dead ends and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:07.470" style="s2">a few men actually reproduced a ton so</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.610" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">once you could think about this is model</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.470" end="00:15:12.150" style="s2">this actually as an option right like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">financial option right we&#39;re above a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.150" end="00:15:15.900" style="s2">certain strike price you&#39;re in the money</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:18.510" style="s2">and below that your blows out of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.900" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">money and if you want an option to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.510" end="00:15:24.060" style="s2">valuable how do you do that and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:26.040" style="s2">answer is increase the volatility uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.060" end="00:15:29.550" style="s2">right so isn&#39;t this interesting as an</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.040" end="00:15:31.170" style="s2">issue in connection ah I love this I do</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.550" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">it&#39;s give you up your alley right</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.170" end="00:15:35.820" style="s2">the argument is something along the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:37.110" style="s2">lines of mother nature says well we know</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.820" end="00:15:39.240" style="s2">that most males are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.110" end="00:15:40.589" style="s2">reproduce forget about the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.240" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">world but going back over time most</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.589" end="00:15:44.130" style="s2">meals are not going to reproduce so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:46.500" style="s2">strategy from a female&#39;s point of view</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.130" end="00:15:48.300" style="s2">is reduce variants and you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.500" end="00:15:50.370" style="s2">pretty much going to be in the money for</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.300" end="00:15:51.540" style="s2">a male it&#39;s like hey you&#39;re probably not</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.370" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">going to be in the money so increase</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.540" end="00:15:55.500" style="s2">variants so again every time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.060" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">conversation about they&#39;re too many men</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.500" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">on the right side of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:16:00.510" style="s2">you should first question should be what</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:03.959" style="s2">about the left side of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.510" end="00:16:05.399" style="s2">and check that out and there are even</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.959" end="00:16:06.779" style="s2">interesting things I mean I think a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.399" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">little bit more speculative but you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.779" end="00:16:12.029" style="s2">the math SATs that boys do better than</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:13.709" style="s2">girls on average by a number of points</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.029" end="00:16:16.709" style="s2">but the reason the conjecture is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.709" end="00:16:19.350" style="s2">reason is about 150 or 200 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.709" end="00:16:22.170" style="s2">fewer boys take the SAT than girls and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.350" end="00:16:24.060" style="s2">the speculation is though boys that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.170" end="00:16:26.339" style="s2">don&#39;t take the SAT or the left tail and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.060" end="00:16:27.630" style="s2">if they were compelled to take it they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.339" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">would fill in the left tail the mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.630" end="00:16:30.660" style="s2">would shift right in line and we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">the same distribution we see everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.660" end="00:16:34.829" style="s2">else so anyway so this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:36.149" style="s2">idea so so I think not only is this a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.829" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">cool idea from the world the point of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.149" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">view a business right and as you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:43.769" style="s2">out in just a strategy or are you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">playing chess but it&#39;s also mother</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.769" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">nature figured this out and incra I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:49.709" style="s2">think I think one of the reasons we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:51.630" style="s2">high variability is because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.709" end="00:16:53.160" style="s2">way you get a higher likelihood of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.630" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">in the money with an option yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.160" end="00:16:56.850" style="s2">how&#39;s that how&#39;s that for a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:59.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s great it&#39;s a perfect setup</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.850" end="00:17:01.740" style="s2">cuz I have a note here that says that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.220" end="00:17:03.990" style="s2">beyond raising the complexity I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.740" end="00:17:07.319" style="s2">closely related corollary is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.990" end="00:17:09.240" style="s2">behind raise the variance right similar</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.319" end="00:17:11.100" style="s2">not quite the same thing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.240" end="00:17:13.230" style="s2">just a couple of factual items some</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.100" end="00:17:15.270" style="s2">mammals are way more asymmetrical and a</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.230" end="00:17:17.490" style="s2">reproduction and even historical humans</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.270" end="00:17:20.309" style="s2">white-tailed deer both the deer hunter</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.490" end="00:17:22.620" style="s2">and I use them as my model species on my</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.309" end="00:17:25.490" style="s2">theories of conscious cognition they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.620" end="00:17:28.110" style="s2">about 6x only about one in six males</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.490" end="00:17:30.450" style="s2">reproduces and of course we&#39;ve all heard</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.110" end="00:17:31.830" style="s2">the story of Genghis Khan supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.450" end="00:17:35.040" style="s2">twenty-five percent of the people in</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.830" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">Central Asia are descended from him so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.040" end="00:17:39.390" style="s2">even in humans the numbers can be more</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:41.340" style="s2">asymmetric right and by the way I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.390" end="00:17:42.570" style="s2">just say that Bo meister speculum by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.340" end="00:17:44.039" style="s2">way a lot of this I think is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.570" end="00:17:45.269" style="s2">you know I think it makes sense but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.039" end="00:17:47.700" style="s2">somewhat speculative but Bo Meister</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.269" end="00:17:50.639" style="s2">speculates that the ratio is much higher</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.700" end="00:17:53.100" style="s2">for humans as well and some of our more</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.639" end="00:17:54.990" style="s2">contemporary social mechanisms have</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.100" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">narrowed the gap between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.990" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">so so I don&#39;t know if we were ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:01.740" style="s2">white-tailed deer territory but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.059" style="s2">and again look at other primates you see</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.740" end="00:18:04.230" style="s2">very similar things and again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.059" end="00:18:05.909" style="s2">within even what there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.230" end="00:18:08.370" style="s2">differences within for example primates</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.909" end="00:18:10.200" style="s2">or other other mammals but the basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.370" end="00:18:11.669" style="s2">setup is pretty widely seen in nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.200" end="00:18:14.250" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s actually a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.669" end="00:18:15.330" style="s2">historical example from US history which</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.250" end="00:18:17.539" style="s2">is the Civil War</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.330" end="00:18:20.940" style="s2">all right the South was behind</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.539" end="00:18:23.490" style="s2">positionally industrially manpower wise</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.940" end="00:18:25.320" style="s2">all kinds of ways but they had better</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.490" end="00:18:27.299" style="s2">generals for least for the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.320" end="00:18:29.909" style="s2">the war and those generals particularly</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.299" end="00:18:31.019" style="s2">realized the only chance he had was to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.909" end="00:18:32.789" style="s2">raise the variance</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.019" end="00:18:36.120" style="s2">hence the battles of Antietam and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.789" end="00:18:39.059" style="s2">Gettysburg where Lee took big huge risk</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.120" end="00:18:41.580" style="s2">and tried to end the war with a big roll</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.059" end="00:18:43.740" style="s2">of dice it turned out that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.580" end="00:18:46.470" style="s2">quite successful but at least he had a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.740" end="00:18:48.690" style="s2">chance and when the Union tried to match</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.470" end="00:18:50.490" style="s2">him smart play for smart play they</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.690" end="00:18:53.100" style="s2">weren&#39;t successful but when they got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.490" end="00:18:55.799" style="s2">guy who saw the biggest picture of all</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.100" end="00:18:58.649" style="s2">grant and realized his job was to not</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.799" end="00:19:00.990" style="s2">lose essentially lower the variance he</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.649" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">gradually just squeezed the south until</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.990" end="00:19:05.850" style="s2">it collapsed so there&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:07.710" style="s2">example of both sides of I will</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.850" end="00:19:09.269" style="s2">mentioned you might jump in that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.710" end="00:19:11.220" style="s2">actually a whole book about asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.269" end="00:19:12.809" style="s2">warfare which is fascinating and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.220" end="00:19:15.899" style="s2">guy looked at asymmetric warfare going</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.809" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">back 200 years and broke it into like 50</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.899" end="00:19:20.940" style="s2">year blocks and what he found was that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.870" style="s2">in ancient days and by the way it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:23.429" style="s2">really interesting thing why is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.870" end="00:19:25.620" style="s2">ancient days couple hundred years ago a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.429" end="00:19:28.019" style="s2">lot of warfare it was less about</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.620" end="00:19:29.669" style="s2">actually winning and more about honor so</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.019" end="00:19:31.080" style="s2">you know if you went off to war you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.669" end="00:19:33.629" style="s2">there to serve your country and honor</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.080" end="00:19:35.129" style="s2">your family and so people you know so</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.629" end="00:19:36.929" style="s2">they would go toe-to-toe with the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.129" end="00:19:39.299" style="s2">stronger thing and just get blasted and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.929" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">then then people start realize if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.299" end="00:19:42.690" style="s2">want to win we need to increase variants</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:44.250" style="s2">and do weird things all these things</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.690" end="00:19:45.389" style="s2">like guerrilla tactics you mentions were</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.250" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">these different techniques from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.389" end="00:19:50.309" style="s2">southern generals and so there so this</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:53.730" style="s2">guy actually documented a 200 year sweep</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.309" end="00:19:55.260" style="s2">of asymmetric warfare and again it fits</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.730" end="00:19:56.140" style="s2">beautifully with a Colonel blotto stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.260" end="00:19:58.780" style="s2">but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.140" end="00:19:59.980" style="s2">what that what you just described by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.780" end="00:20:01.750" style="s2">way it&#39;s an entry in question why have</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.980" end="00:20:03.580" style="s2">Wars been predominantly in fact anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.750" end="00:20:04.500" style="s2">risky why they predominately send men to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:06.460" style="s2">do those things</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.500" end="00:20:08.020" style="s2">exploration why he sent men and not</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.460" end="00:20:09.790" style="s2">women the answer is because men are</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.020" end="00:20:11.410" style="s2">expendable right if you don&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.790" end="00:20:13.630" style="s2">many of them to propagate the species</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.410" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">they&#39;re expendable so send them off to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.630" end="00:20:18.220" style="s2">do all the dirty jobs right anyway it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting stuff I was at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.220" end="00:20:22.810" style="s2">book how the week wind wars by argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.550" style="s2">off very good man yes it is that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.810" end="00:20:26.650" style="s2">book and back to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.550" end="00:20:29.170" style="s2">ability making men expendable there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.650" end="00:20:31.150" style="s2">famous quote by Napoleon after a big</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.170" end="00:20:33.070" style="s2">loss in one of his battles he said was</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.150" end="00:20:35.020" style="s2">he concerned about the long-term history</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.070" end="00:20:37.330" style="s2">of France because of these big losses</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.020" end="00:20:40.070" style="s2">and he puffed himself up and said my</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.330" end="00:20:43.170" style="s2">soldiers will replace the losses tonight</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.070" end="00:20:45.940" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.170" end="00:20:47.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a good one so let&#39;s get back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.940" end="00:20:49.150" style="s2">the mainstream of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.470" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">about the book you know sort of at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.150" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">very core of it is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.770" style="s2">between skill and luck maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:58.510" style="s2">start with describing what those two</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.770" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">things are and what you mean by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.510" end="00:21:02.830" style="s2">skill and luck in the rest of the book</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">exactly and I&#39;ll just say that um I</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.830" end="00:21:06.160" style="s2">think that there are a lot of aphorisms</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:08.710" style="s2">about luck you know luck is where</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.160" end="00:21:11.020" style="s2">success meets opportunity or preparation</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.710" end="00:21:12.340" style="s2">meets opportunity and the harder I work</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.020" end="00:21:13.930" style="s2">the luckier I get things like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.340" end="00:21:15.850" style="s2">actually think a lot of those things</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.930" end="00:21:19.150" style="s2">they have a good sentiment which is I</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.850" end="00:21:21.490" style="s2">kind of work hard but they&#39;re very Mis</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.150" end="00:21:23.020" style="s2">founded I think so let me let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.490" end="00:21:25.330" style="s2">take a moment to define both of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.020" end="00:21:26.770" style="s2">things first I would define skill right</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.330" end="00:21:28.420" style="s2">out of the dictionary right which is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.770" end="00:21:30.100" style="s2">ability to apply one&#39;s knowledge readily</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.420" end="00:21:31.930" style="s2">in execution or performance right so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.100" end="00:21:33.670" style="s2">know how to do something and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.930" end="00:21:35.080" style="s2">asked to do it you can do it on cue so</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.670" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">you could think about a musician or an</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.080" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">athlete or something like that luck is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:41.320" style="s2">much more difficult to define and by the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:42.670" style="s2">way this gets right into philosophy you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.320" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">almost have to put a stake in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.670" end="00:21:47.800" style="s2">to sort of limit the discussion Nick</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:50.020" style="s2">rush pressure a professor of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.800" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">at University of Pittsburgh wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.020" end="00:21:55.030" style="s2">about luck and I I sort of liked his</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:57.300" style="s2">definition so he said luck exists when</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.030" end="00:21:59.620" style="s2">three conditions are in place one is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.300" end="00:22:01.810" style="s2">happens to an individual or an</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.620" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">organization so you can you can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.810" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">figure out the unit to which it happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.940" end="00:22:08.350" style="s2">second it could be good or bad and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:08.800" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to leave anybody the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.350" end="00:22:10.300" style="s2">impression</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.800" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">it&#39;s symmetrical because it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.300" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">not we can talk more about that in a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:15.640" style="s2">moments but there is such a thing as</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:17.230" style="s2">good luck or bad luck and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.640" end="00:22:19.060" style="s2">even if you look at the etymology words</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:20.980" style="s2">related to Locke&#39;s things like fortune</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.060" end="00:22:23.620" style="s2">and chance many of them don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.980" end="00:22:25.450" style="s2">asymmetry luck I think would and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.620" end="00:22:27.820" style="s2">final thing in this is a trickiest one</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.450" end="00:22:30.040" style="s2">is it&#39;s reasonable to expect a different</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.820" end="00:22:32.020" style="s2">outcome could have occurred so for you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.040" end="00:22:34.420" style="s2">rewind the tape of time and you play it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.020" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">again it is reasonable to expect a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.420" end="00:22:37.990" style="s2">different outcome could occur so those</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:39.670" style="s2">are that does that those I think are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.990" end="00:22:41.710" style="s2">basic definitions and I think Jim if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.670" end="00:22:44.470" style="s2">sort of try to get to the core of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.710" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">book there&#39;s one illustration I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.470" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for people to do it mentally</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:51.190" style="s2">as well is I call it the luck skill</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:53.020" style="s2">continuum so you can imagine a Content</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:55.450" style="s2">just a straight line on the far left</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.020" end="00:22:58.060" style="s2">we&#39;ll call it all luck no skill</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.450" end="00:23:00.130" style="s2">so activities where skill plays no role</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.060" end="00:23:03.910" style="s2">whatsoever in your success and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.130" end="00:23:06.580" style="s2">things like lotteries farewell roulette</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.910" end="00:23:09.550" style="s2">wheel those would be examples of that on</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.580" end="00:23:12.430" style="s2">the far right would be pure skill no</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.550" end="00:23:14.830" style="s2">luck or luck has no effect whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.430" end="00:23:17.500" style="s2">and again nothing&#39;s perfect over there</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.830" end="00:23:20.770" style="s2">but it would be things like running</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.500" end="00:23:22.060" style="s2">races or swimming races or chess is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:24.940" style="s2">probably close to that side of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.060" end="00:23:26.200" style="s2">spectrum as well and then the the key is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.940" end="00:23:28.300" style="s2">that almost everything in life is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.200" end="00:23:30.250" style="s2">between those two extremes and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.300" end="00:23:31.900" style="s2">question is where is your activity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.250" end="00:23:34.210" style="s2">where does it find itself on that luck</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.900" end="00:23:36.970" style="s2">skill continuum and then from there</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.210" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">spill out the kinds of strategies or</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.970" end="00:23:40.540" style="s2">approaches you should take to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.590" end="00:23:42.040" style="s2">about how to approach that particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.540" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">activity in the way that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.040" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">effective as possible so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.350" end="00:23:47.500" style="s2">the basic set up like what is luck what</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:50.170" style="s2">is skill and by the way by definition</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.500" end="00:23:52.810" style="s2">this idea that you can create your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.170" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">luck if you accept what I just said</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.810" end="00:23:56.370" style="s2">that&#39;s just not true right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:58.930" style="s2">anything you can do to improve your</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.370" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">likelihood of success that by definition</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.930" end="00:24:02.890" style="s2">is skill right that&#39;s something within</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:04.810" style="s2">your control so it goes back to same</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.890" end="00:24:06.580" style="s2">thing I think the aphorisms about luck</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.810" end="00:24:08.290" style="s2">are often encouraging people to work</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.580" end="00:24:11.140" style="s2">hard or prepare and those are all good</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.290" end="00:24:13.060" style="s2">sentiments but they don&#39;t really pass a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.140" end="00:24:16.490" style="s2">test if you think about defining these</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.060" end="00:24:17.480" style="s2">things with even with a modicum of rigor</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.490" end="00:24:20.540" style="s2">I will talk about this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.480" end="00:24:22.820" style="s2">later but my own life and I used to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.540" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">a presentation I gave the second year</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.820" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">MBA students called my famous career</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:30.050" style="s2">where I pointed out that probably 60% of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.980" end="00:24:32.750" style="s2">my successes that were due to luck but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.050" end="00:24:35.660" style="s2">also did point out that I was prepared</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.750" end="00:24:39.110" style="s2">to take advantage of my luck in certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.660" end="00:24:41.230" style="s2">ways the example I gave specially second</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.110" end="00:24:44.270" style="s2">year MBA students was I always</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.230" end="00:24:46.520" style="s2">maintained myself and my wife being</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.270" end="00:24:48.679" style="s2">debt-free or as close to it as we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.520" end="00:24:50.150" style="s2">with money in the bank even we were</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.679" end="00:24:52.580" style="s2">young and poor so that when opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.150" end="00:24:55.280" style="s2">came up we could just hop on it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.580" end="00:24:58.280" style="s2">again and again and again that non being</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.280" end="00:25:00.410" style="s2">nailed down was interacted with luck in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.280" end="00:25:02.210" style="s2">a very interesting way so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.410" end="00:25:03.980" style="s2">had five or six pieces of luck in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.210" end="00:25:05.540" style="s2">life why people couldn&#39;t have taken</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.980" end="00:25:06.679" style="s2">advantage of them because they were over</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.540" end="00:25:08.840" style="s2">committed somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.679" end="00:25:11.150" style="s2">and so I think you can manage your</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.840" end="00:25:13.010" style="s2">interaction with luck yeah I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.150" end="00:25:14.840" style="s2">that and I would just say this that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:17.240" style="s2">here&#39;s another even more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.840" end="00:25:19.429" style="s2">thing which is to say will say you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.240" end="00:25:20.750" style="s2">will describe skills what&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.429" end="00:25:23.480" style="s2">control versus what&#39;s not in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.750" end="00:25:24.890" style="s2">control and will say luck is what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.480" end="00:25:28.670" style="s2">in your control so very much to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.890" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">point you&#39;re saying hey I my skill was</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.670" end="00:25:33.020" style="s2">making sure that things that were in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:35.510" style="s2">control were good right so I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.020" end="00:25:36.890" style="s2">was financially flexible that kept</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.510" end="00:25:38.540" style="s2">building my mind and making myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.890" end="00:25:40.550" style="s2">learning every single day to make myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.540" end="00:25:42.230" style="s2">more valuable in the workplace and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.550" end="00:25:43.910" style="s2">forth and then when some opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.230" end="00:25:45.380" style="s2">presented itself that was out of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.910" end="00:25:47.150" style="s2">control I was in a position to take</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.380" end="00:25:48.800" style="s2">advantage of it right so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.150" end="00:25:50.750" style="s2">all hangs together reasonably well and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.800" end="00:25:52.910" style="s2">like you said the Society of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.750" end="00:25:54.440" style="s2">prepared or this idea of having it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.910" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">almost I would say it&#39;s in your control</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.440" end="00:25:59.690" style="s2">so enhance it it would fall at least by</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:01.490" style="s2">my definition as as a skill I like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.690" end="00:26:03.380" style="s2">this could be semantics it could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.490" end="00:26:04.790" style="s2">semantics but yeah I think I I think I</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.380" end="00:26:05.540" style="s2">think we&#39;re yeah I think we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.790" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">something very similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.540" end="00:26:10.280" style="s2">I like that up I will frame that as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.809" style="s2">skill of taking advantage of luck right</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.280" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">SEC and of course that&#39;s what poker is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.809" end="00:26:17.270" style="s2">right 100% to a significant degree right</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.460" style="s2">at least in the short term long term</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.270" end="00:26:21.050" style="s2">it&#39;s just skill but in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.460" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2">it&#39;s taking advantage of luck</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.050" end="00:26:26.419" style="s2">appropriately when it shows up so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.300" end="00:26:28.309" style="s2">turn now to the very interesting part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.419" end="00:26:29.960" style="s2">the book and probably the one that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.309" end="00:26:30.290" style="s2">of people gonna find most useful which</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.960" end="00:26:33.110" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.290" end="00:26:35.000" style="s2">practical ways to disentangle skill</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.110" end="00:26:37.460" style="s2">versus luck which people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.000" end="00:26:38.570" style="s2">necessarily very good at yeah so well I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.460" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">mean I would just say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.570" end="00:26:42.380" style="s2">different in different things so I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:43.780" style="s2">say that and we have a chapter we</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.380" end="00:26:47.000" style="s2">dedicate to sort of asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.780" end="00:26:48.740" style="s2">doing this but the most formal way to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.000" end="00:26:51.050" style="s2">this there&#39;s actually a really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.740" end="00:26:53.570" style="s2">little theorem in statistics which says</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.050" end="00:26:55.820" style="s2">that the variance of distribution</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.570" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">independent distribution a plus the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:26:59.930" style="s2">variance of distribution independent</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:02.360" style="s2">distribution B equals the variance of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.930" end="00:27:05.210" style="s2">plus B so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really nice</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:07.370" style="s2">little property and that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:09.020" style="s2">thing we use to try to codify this for</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.370" end="00:27:12.620" style="s2">example in sports so I just use as</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.020" end="00:27:14.030" style="s2">sports so what&#39;s going on here well how</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.620" end="00:27:16.520" style="s2">do you do this so let&#39;s just pick a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.030" end="00:27:19.610" style="s2">sport just a big basketball for instance</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.520" end="00:27:21.950" style="s2">so the and the NBA they play 82 games</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.610" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">and so you have this equation and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.950" end="00:27:27.470" style="s2">say well how can we sort it out</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:29.000" style="s2">well variance of luck is something we</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.470" end="00:27:30.920" style="s2">would know that&#39;s a it&#39;s a modification</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.000" end="00:27:32.810" style="s2">of a binomial model right so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.920" end="00:27:35.030" style="s2">basically say let&#39;s model out if every</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.810" end="00:27:36.380" style="s2">game was decided by a coin toss how</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.030" end="00:27:37.640" style="s2">would that look in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.380" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">distribution so that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.640" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">difficult to do mathematically and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:43.160" style="s2">gives me one of my first variances the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:44.570" style="s2">second thing we have is the actual</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.160" end="00:27:47.030" style="s2">empirical results we actually know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.570" end="00:27:48.800" style="s2">win-loss records of teams over time we</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.030" end="00:27:51.530" style="s2">usually do multiple seasons to take out</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.800" end="00:27:53.750" style="s2">some of the noise and so we have two of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.530" end="00:27:55.970" style="s2">the components of the equation right so</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.750" end="00:27:58.430" style="s2">you have variance of what look like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.970" end="00:28:00.200" style="s2">luck we have the actual results and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.430" end="00:28:01.550" style="s2">way to plug the gap is to say what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.200" end="00:28:03.650" style="s2">the variance of skill that solves for</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.550" end="00:28:05.330" style="s2">that so I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.650" end="00:28:07.100" style="s2">classic techniques to do that when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.330" end="00:28:08.840" style="s2">have data that are that are really clean</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.100" end="00:28:10.900" style="s2">I&#39;ll leave it at that that and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.840" end="00:28:13.190" style="s2">really good clean way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.900" end="00:28:14.660" style="s2">disentangling luck and skill especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.190" end="00:28:16.850" style="s2">in activities that are sort of clean</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.660" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">like that very good and then at a higher</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.850" end="00:28:20.930" style="s2">level you talk about and the seem to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:22.550" style="s2">leaves two by two matrix maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.930" end="00:28:25.130" style="s2">talk about that a little bit yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.550" end="00:28:27.620" style="s2">think that not seems point is that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.130" end="00:28:29.810" style="s2">kind of thing I just described is very</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.620" end="00:28:31.580" style="s2">well suited to well-behaved</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.810" end="00:28:33.650" style="s2">distributions right so normal</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.580" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">distributions win losses of basketball</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.650" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">teams and even to some degree things</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:41.300" style="s2">like the results of businesses or</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:43.510" style="s2">investors or so forth but where it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.300" end="00:28:46.450" style="s2">really breaks down are these district</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.510" end="00:28:48.400" style="s2">that are very fat-tailed so where we</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.450" end="00:28:51.820" style="s2">have these very infrequent but very</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.400" end="00:28:53.290" style="s2">large effects so my argument is so so</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.820" end="00:28:55.690" style="s2">this a lot of stuff on luck and skill</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.290" end="00:28:57.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really do that much doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.690" end="00:28:59.920" style="s2">that much to say about those fat tail</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.340" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">distribution parts of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.920" end="00:29:05.320" style="s2">said there&#39;s so much here that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:07.060" style="s2">untapped just in the regular world right</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.320" end="00:29:08.680" style="s2">the more bit better behaved parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.060" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">world that it&#39;s still incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.680" end="00:29:12.580" style="s2">relevant so my my whole thing on luck</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.890" style="s2">and skill is that I think very few</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.580" end="00:29:16.870" style="s2">people think enough about it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.890" end="00:29:19.090" style="s2">certainly in a sort of rigorous way and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.870" end="00:29:21.730" style="s2">that it has applications to large</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.090" end="00:29:23.680" style="s2">swathes of the world but just to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.730" end="00:29:26.530" style="s2">super clear that this sort of Nassim</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.680" end="00:29:28.150" style="s2">Taleb fat-tailed component it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.530" end="00:29:30.130" style="s2">be much less relevant to the plight</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.150" end="00:29:31.390" style="s2">there and and again there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:33.340" style="s2">fads tailed things we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.390" end="00:29:35.380" style="s2">this a bit too like in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.340" end="00:29:37.540" style="s2">physical worlds like earthquakes and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.380" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">forth I&#39;m talking mostly about social</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.540" end="00:29:40.900" style="s2">things so for example we and we could</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:42.070" style="s2">talk a little bit about this but how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.900" end="00:29:44.470" style="s2">when we think about things like</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.070" end="00:29:47.170" style="s2">successes of movies or successes like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.470" end="00:29:49.450" style="s2">books those are almost impossible things</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.170" end="00:29:52.390" style="s2">to model because of the way the social</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.450" end="00:29:54.580" style="s2">dynamics unfold yeah also in the social</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.390" end="00:29:57.820" style="s2">world wars tend to be fat-tailed</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.580" end="00:30:00.190" style="s2">revolutions and probably even financial</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.820" end="00:30:02.590" style="s2">crises so you know there is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.190" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">do think it&#39;s worth considering fat</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.590" end="00:30:07.240" style="s2">tails as they insert themselves into our</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.620" style="s2">real world for sure I want to draw</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.240" end="00:30:11.350" style="s2">attention to it I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.620" end="00:30:13.000" style="s2">you said I want to draw attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.350" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">idea and just say that that may be</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.000" end="00:30:15.880" style="s2">beyond the purview of what we can really</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.650" end="00:30:17.470" style="s2">do with these sets of tools but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.880" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">this actually would not be a bad time to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.470" end="00:30:21.660" style="s2">talk a bit about this which is and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:24.550" style="s2">also through for me was a very Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.660" end="00:30:26.050" style="s2">Institute influenced set of ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.550" end="00:30:27.820" style="s2">when we talk about the nature of luck</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.050" end="00:30:28.990" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of two different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.820" end="00:30:30.610" style="s2">think about one are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.990" end="00:30:33.370" style="s2">largely independent so these are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.610" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">know coin tosses or even if you model</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.370" end="00:30:37.450" style="s2">like baseball players batting averages</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:39.820" style="s2">and so forth they&#39;re not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.450" end="00:30:41.230" style="s2">independent processes but for the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.820" end="00:30:42.340" style="s2">part that&#39;s a pretty good way to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.230" end="00:30:45.370" style="s2">about it and they&#39;ll get you pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.340" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">close to the truth but most of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.370" end="00:30:47.980" style="s2">interesting things are many of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">interesting is in life are these social</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.980" end="00:30:54.280" style="s2">processes right where it&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:56.940" style="s2">cumulative processes and it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.280" end="00:30:59.070" style="s2">how information propagates across a net</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.940" end="00:31:01.890" style="s2">and those things are inherently very</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:04.200" style="s2">difficult to predict and so as you as</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.890" end="00:31:06.210" style="s2">you know well predictions of which books</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.200" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">will succeed which songs will be popular</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.210" end="00:31:12.030" style="s2">which movies will be blockbusters</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:14.310" style="s2">it&#39;s just inherently difficult known to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.030" end="00:31:15.870" style="s2">be inherently difficult so there was one</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.310" end="00:31:17.910" style="s2">there was one experiment that was done</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.870" end="00:31:19.380" style="s2">by one of our former postdocs Duncan</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.910" end="00:31:22.260" style="s2">Watts he did it with Matt so again they</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.380" end="00:31:24.870" style="s2">competed odds called Music Lab where</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:26.490" style="s2">they they they basically got college</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.870" end="00:31:28.470" style="s2">students and this is thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.490" end="00:31:31.020" style="s2">college students and they asked him to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.470" end="00:31:33.350" style="s2">look at songs by unknown bands just just</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.020" end="00:31:35.460" style="s2">under fifty songs by unknown bands and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.350" end="00:31:37.590" style="s2">they did something super interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.460" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">which was they had a control which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.590" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">20% of population and then the other 10%</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">each went into eight social world so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:46.470" style="s2">could think about these almost literally</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.650" end="00:31:48.150" style="s2">as alternate universes and so they said</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.470" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">listen to the songs and rate them you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.150" end="00:31:51.210" style="s2">know love it or hate it and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:53.190" style="s2">really like the song you can download it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.210" end="00:31:55.740" style="s2">so this is just that you know tell us</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.190" end="00:31:56.910" style="s2">about your musical tastes and in one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.740" end="00:31:59.250" style="s2">the extreme versions by the way they</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.910" end="00:32:01.170" style="s2">showed a leaderboard so one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.250" end="00:32:03.930" style="s2">liked songs were the most downloaded</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.170" end="00:32:05.400" style="s2">songs and what they found was that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.930" end="00:32:06.750" style="s2">control was that obviously a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.400" end="00:32:09.030" style="s2">some sort of encouraged objective</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.750" end="00:32:11.520" style="s2">assessment of the songs but what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.030" end="00:32:13.020" style="s2">found was the pattern of how people</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.520" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">liked and downloaded songs was</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.020" end="00:32:16.620" style="s2">extraordinarily important so just to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:18.510" style="s2">clear the bad songs really did well in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.620" end="00:32:19.920" style="s2">the social worlds but if you were sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.510" end="00:32:21.270" style="s2">of in the top third like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.920" end="00:32:22.860" style="s2">anything could happen and there was one</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.270" end="00:32:24.510" style="s2">particular song I thought really</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.860" end="00:32:26.340" style="s2">captured the whole experiment perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.510" end="00:32:27.960" style="s2">and the independent condition it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.340" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">smack dab in the middle so just consider</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.960" end="00:32:32.520" style="s2">a completely average song in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:35.010" style="s2">social worlds it was the number one hit</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.520" end="00:32:37.160" style="s2">and another one of the social worlds it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.010" end="00:32:39.900" style="s2">was at the very bottom decile terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.160" end="00:32:42.420" style="s2">popularity so it just goes to show that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.900" end="00:32:44.280" style="s2">if you rewound the tape of time and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.420" end="00:32:46.050" style="s2">played it again you know ask the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.280" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">question would Madonna be Madonna what</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.050" end="00:32:49.370" style="s2">star wars beat star wars with Harry</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:52.830" style="s2">Potter be Harry Potter and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.370" end="00:32:53.970" style="s2">highly highly unlikely and that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">another component that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.970" end="00:32:58.770" style="s2">mentioning in all this which is we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.350" style="s2">all storytellers right we are all</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.770" end="00:33:05.100" style="s2">masters at creating narratives to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.350" end="00:33:07.410" style="s2">explain things after the fact so now</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.100" end="00:33:09.210" style="s2">that something becomes popular we all</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.410" end="00:33:10.500" style="s2">create a set of narratives to explain</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.210" end="00:33:12.450" style="s2">why it became pop</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.500" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">there even though we are clueless about</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.450" end="00:33:15.540" style="s2">the underlying mechanisms so that to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:17.550" style="s2">is one of the most fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.540" end="00:33:20.370" style="s2">components this thing I&#39;m luck and again</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.550" end="00:33:22.140" style="s2">very close tie back to SFI and how again</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.370" end="00:33:24.590" style="s2">information propagating across network</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.140" end="00:33:28.890" style="s2">is that you just have to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.590" end="00:33:31.260" style="s2">circumspect about your assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.890" end="00:33:34.020" style="s2">what has done well in a social realm and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.260" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">of course anticipating what will do well</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.020" end="00:33:39.180" style="s2">in a social realm as well and so that to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.750" end="00:33:41.370" style="s2">me was a really a big eye-opener you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.180" end="00:33:42.900" style="s2">mentioned things like markets and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.370" end="00:33:45.000" style="s2">think that you could almost use the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.900" end="00:33:46.800" style="s2">kind of model like propagation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.000" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">information across Network to understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.800" end="00:33:51.270" style="s2">how booms and crashes happen right they</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:55.110" style="s2">sort of fat tail events so super super</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.270" end="00:33:56.400" style="s2">interesting stuff and you know even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.110" end="00:33:57.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that as you as you point</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.400" end="00:33:58.830" style="s2">out the very out outside even if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.660" end="00:34:01.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know the details of how these</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.830" end="00:34:04.260" style="s2">models work appreciation the very core</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.140" end="00:34:07.050" style="s2">idea itself is incredibly valuable the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.260" end="00:34:09.330" style="s2">yeah that Music Lab result was amazing</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.050" end="00:34:12.540" style="s2">and it confirmed one of my personal</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.330" end="00:34:15.690" style="s2">biases which is I hate to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.540" end="00:34:17.940" style="s2">those kinds of idiosyncratic pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.690" end="00:34:19.530" style="s2">type things for instance you know even</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.940" end="00:34:20.610" style="s2">though I did it once mostly just to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.530" end="00:34:22.860" style="s2">learn how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.610" end="00:34:24.210" style="s2">the idea of betting on movies doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.860" end="00:34:26.730" style="s2">appeal to me in the slightest while</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.210" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">betting on studios might be reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.730" end="00:34:30.810" style="s2">right because your movie might be great</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t succeed for a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.810" end="00:34:34.950" style="s2">reasons that have nothing to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">innate quality of the movie and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.950" end="00:34:39.899" style="s2">just not the kind of thing I personally</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:41.310" style="s2">like to do and although obviously there</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.899" end="00:34:43.590" style="s2">are people who do it know how successful</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.310" end="00:34:45.570" style="s2">they are that&#39;s another question much</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:47.340" style="s2">better to you know to own a studio and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.570" end="00:34:49.800" style="s2">have a portfolio and maybe you&#39;re better</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.340" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2">on average making movies and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.800" end="00:34:52.649" style="s2">other point I want to hop on you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.270" end="00:34:54.899" style="s2">mentioned narrative and anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.649" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">listened to the show has known that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.899" end="00:34:58.830" style="s2">quite often talk about the power of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:01.350" style="s2">narrative and had various people bring</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.830" end="00:35:03.180" style="s2">their perspectives on it and it is you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.350" end="00:35:04.980" style="s2">know as you started to allude to try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.180" end="00:35:06.810" style="s2">get you&#39;ll go a little further it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.980" end="00:35:09.420" style="s2">source of a you know a fair number of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.810" end="00:35:12.120" style="s2">human biases and I&#39;m particularly</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.420" end="00:35:14.040" style="s2">interested in the route neuroscience of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.120" end="00:35:16.170" style="s2">it you know Mike Gazzaniga is split</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.040" end="00:35:18.390" style="s2">brain studies with your reference in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.170" end="00:35:20.610" style="s2">book where when you separate the right</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.390" end="00:35:22.770" style="s2">brain from the left brain if you provide</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.610" end="00:35:23.790" style="s2">something to the side of the brain that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.770" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">can&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.790" end="00:35:27.210" style="s2">if it&#39;s the left brain which is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:28.680" style="s2">verbal part it&#39;ll make up total</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.210" end="00:35:31.050" style="s2">to try to make sense of what it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.680" end="00:35:33.210" style="s2">unconsciously knows so maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.050" end="00:35:35.750" style="s2">talk a little bit about how narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.210" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">a great source of cognitive bias</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.750" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">definitely so let me let me mention one</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:41.640" style="s2">thing maybe we can put this in the notes</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:43.560" style="s2">to that on the website for the success</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.640" end="00:35:46.590" style="s2">equation we have a little poly or urn</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.560" end="00:35:48.330" style="s2">model and and this is a really good way</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.590" end="00:35:49.800" style="s2">for people to play around this concept</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.330" end="00:35:51.540" style="s2">and almost like to train their</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.800" end="00:35:53.370" style="s2">intuitions a bit about it and the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.540" end="00:35:55.710" style="s2">the model is set up is we have Mart and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.370" end="00:35:58.050" style="s2">you can specify this conditions as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.710" end="00:36:00.300" style="s2">as you see fit but we have marbles of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.050" end="00:36:02.940" style="s2">different colors five black marbles four</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.300" end="00:36:04.920" style="s2">green marbles three red marbles and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.940" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">forth and then that&#39;s a pull and replace</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.920" end="00:36:09.360" style="s2">model so what the simulation does is it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:10.770" style="s2">blindly pulls one of the models and of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.360" end="00:36:11.790" style="s2">the marbles and obviously there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.770" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">to be a probability of that happening</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.790" end="00:36:16.170" style="s2">and then matches it with a marble the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.330" style="s2">same color and puts it back in and does</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.170" end="00:36:20.100" style="s2">the same thing over and over so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.330" end="00:36:21.990" style="s2">reason I did that way is the initial</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.100" end="00:36:24.420" style="s2">number of marbles is a proxy for skill</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.990" end="00:36:27.660" style="s2">in quotation marks right and then that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.420" end="00:36:29.190" style="s2">process itself ends up being where the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.660" end="00:36:31.500" style="s2">luck comes in so if the draw is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.190" end="00:36:32.700" style="s2">obviously a probabilistic draw and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.500" end="00:36:34.380" style="s2">think one of the big lessons from that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.700" end="00:36:36.390" style="s2">Jim just trying to riff on something you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.380" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">mentioned a moment ago is that at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.390" end="00:36:39.930" style="s2">certain point you get locking in these</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:42.120" style="s2">processes right so so clearly the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.930" end="00:36:44.010" style="s2">popular marvel gets picked and replaced</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.120" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">then the probability of succeeding goes</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.010" end="00:36:46.950" style="s2">up but but you do get locked in after a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:48.810" style="s2">certain number of sessions so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.950" end="00:36:50.490" style="s2">really interesting thing that even</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.810" end="00:36:51.930" style="s2">things where there is varying skill and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.490" end="00:36:53.070" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s fun to play the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.930" end="00:36:54.600" style="s2">simulation because you can do it a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.070" end="00:36:56.340" style="s2">zillion times and see like when do the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.600" end="00:36:57.750" style="s2">low skill things become the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.340" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.750" end="00:37:02.040" style="s2">um this stuff on Gazzaniga and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:04.620" style="s2">interpreter I love all this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.040" end="00:37:06.180" style="s2">you&#39;re exactly right just a transition</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.620" end="00:37:07.770" style="s2">into that a bit and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.180" end="00:37:09.450" style="s2">described it incredibly well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.770" end="00:37:11.420" style="s2">Michael Gazzaniga is a neuroscientist</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.450" end="00:37:13.350" style="s2">who did work on split brain patients and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.420" end="00:37:15.090" style="s2">these are people who have to live</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.350" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">debilitating epilepsy they failed all</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.090" end="00:37:18.600" style="s2">their treatments and those last-ditch</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:19.830" style="s2">effort they sever the corpus callosum so</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.600" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">very much to your point out by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.830" end="00:37:23.610" style="s2">the people do much better after this</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:25.050" style="s2">right they feel much better and and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.610" end="00:37:26.100" style="s2">relieves that the symptoms that seizures</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.050" end="00:37:28.050" style="s2">going from one hemisphere to the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.100" end="00:37:30.060" style="s2">but it sets up this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.050" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">interesting experimental condition and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.060" end="00:37:32.580" style="s2">modularity and that you described it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.950" end="00:37:34.050" style="s2">extremely well</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.580" end="00:37:36.270" style="s2">you can give a cue to the right</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.050" end="00:37:37.230" style="s2">hemisphere with your left eye and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.270" end="00:37:38.760" style="s2">person we reacted</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.230" end="00:37:40.260" style="s2">you ask them why they&#39;re doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.760" end="00:37:41.430" style="s2">they just make up a complete story right</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.260" end="00:37:43.020" style="s2">because the left brain is where your</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.430" end="00:37:44.250" style="s2">language resides so they call this part</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.020" end="00:37:45.960" style="s2">of your brain in your left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.250" end="00:37:47.970" style="s2">the interpreter and the job of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.960" end="00:37:50.340" style="s2">interpreter is to close cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.970" end="00:37:52.109" style="s2">loops so I throw some effect at you I</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.340" end="00:37:53.670" style="s2">throw some sort of an outcome of you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.109" end="00:37:55.650" style="s2">you are going to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.670" end="00:37:57.600" style="s2">narrative to explain why that thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.650" end="00:37:59.730" style="s2">happened and we all do it effortlessly</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.600" end="00:38:01.800" style="s2">and naturally when you&#39;re read it in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.730" end="00:38:03.810" style="s2">split brain literature it&#39;s actually as</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.800" end="00:38:05.490" style="s2">you point out very humorous like people</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.810" end="00:38:06.630" style="s2">come up with these crazy stories to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.490" end="00:38:08.940" style="s2">explain what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.630" end="00:38:10.590" style="s2">but the key more sobering point is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.940" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">interpreters working in all of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.590" end="00:38:15.869" style="s2">brains all the time the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.400" style="s2">time very benignly but of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.869" end="00:38:20.430" style="s2">making up stories for things that make</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.400" end="00:38:22.650" style="s2">no sense whatsoever now here&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.430" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">for me is that the interpreter doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.650" end="00:38:27.180" style="s2">know about luck so typically when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:28.290" style="s2">see a good outcome your brain is going</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.180" end="00:38:30.060" style="s2">to come up with a narrative to explain</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.290" end="00:38:32.609" style="s2">things that there&#39;s something good</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.060" end="00:38:34.440" style="s2">behind it and when you see a bad outcome</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.609" end="00:38:36.030" style="s2">you assume that something bad is behind</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.440" end="00:38:38.820" style="s2">it and this is where it gets into a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.030" end="00:38:41.250" style="s2">fundamental issue of process versus</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.820" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">outcome so I mentioned one of the biases</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.250" end="00:38:45.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a very powerful one is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:48.330" style="s2">called outcome bias is that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.630" end="00:38:51.240" style="s2">think that bad outcomes are consequence</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.330" end="00:38:52.830" style="s2">of bad decisions which is not always the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.240" end="00:38:54.540" style="s2">case where good outcomes are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.830" end="00:38:56.460" style="s2">consequence of good decisions and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.540" end="00:38:58.619" style="s2">clearly not the case so outcome bias is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:39:00.300" style="s2">a huge one you mentioned I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.619" end="00:39:02.100" style="s2">you have an affinity for poker you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.300" end="00:39:04.140" style="s2">mentioned poker a few moments ago Annie</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.100" end="00:39:06.119" style="s2">Duke and her book thinking in bets calls</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.140" end="00:39:08.130" style="s2">this resulting so she claims that sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.119" end="00:39:10.020" style="s2">of the poker version of this outcome</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.130" end="00:39:12.600" style="s2">bias and that&#39;s a really really bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.020" end="00:39:14.670" style="s2">habit to get into and that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.600" end="00:39:16.140" style="s2">another point at least along luck skill</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.670" end="00:39:17.340" style="s2">thing so when you are looking at when</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.140" end="00:39:19.740" style="s2">you&#39;re in the lexical continuum if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.340" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">you&#39;re on the skill side you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.740" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">a lot of sample size to know that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:25.320" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s behind process right so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:27.090" style="s2">you and I run a race you know the faster</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.320" end="00:39:28.830" style="s2">guy is going to win the foot race and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.090" end="00:39:30.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have to speculate about you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.830" end="00:39:32.970" style="s2">whether there was that it&#39;s skill or</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.660" end="00:39:35.070" style="s2">something else by contrast if you move</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.970" end="00:39:37.800" style="s2">over to luck sided continuum it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.070" end="00:39:39.270" style="s2">about process and outcomes are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.800" end="00:39:41.100" style="s2">misleading because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.270" end="00:39:42.510" style="s2">noise or luck that&#39;s distorting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.100" end="00:39:44.850" style="s2">actual signal in those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.510" end="00:39:46.590" style="s2">situations so that&#39;s another thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.850" end="00:39:48.510" style="s2">say when you&#39;re on the luck side of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.590" end="00:39:49.110" style="s2">continuum where again skill plays a role</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.510" end="00:39:52.260" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.110" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">time but that the short term the skill</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">to signal-to-noise ratio is relatively</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:39:59.340" style="s2">low you need to focus on process and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:00.660" style="s2">that&#39;s where this outcome buys and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.340" end="00:40:03.530" style="s2">that&#39;s where the interpreter becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.660" end="00:40:05.850" style="s2">really really problematic thing because</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.530" end="00:40:08.790" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna start to make associations</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.850" end="00:40:11.220" style="s2">that are unfair to make and buy this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.790" end="00:40:12.990" style="s2">pervasive I mean this is all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.220" end="00:40:15.120" style="s2">sports where a coach will make a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.990" end="00:40:17.910" style="s2">decision that&#39;s the right decision but</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.120" end="00:40:19.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out it works it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.910" end="00:40:21.360" style="s2">business all the time happens and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.350" end="00:40:23.490" style="s2">investing all the time so the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.360" end="00:40:25.380" style="s2">Gazzaniga stuff on left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.490" end="00:40:27.690" style="s2">interpreter incredibly important for</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.380" end="00:40:28.620" style="s2">people understand by the way Bob shows</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.690" end="00:40:30.600" style="s2">got a brand new book out called</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.620" end="00:40:31.650" style="s2">narrative economics I think we talked</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.600" end="00:40:34.230" style="s2">about this the Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.650" end="00:40:35.880" style="s2">symposium a couple weeks ago and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.230" end="00:40:38.340" style="s2">a whole book that just dedicated this</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.880" end="00:40:40.350" style="s2">idea of how NER it is come to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.340" end="00:40:41.550" style="s2">forefront demand our attention for some</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.350" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">period of time and lead to certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.550" end="00:40:45.120" style="s2">actions it may or may not make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:46.980" style="s2">so I think this is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.120" end="00:40:49.020" style="s2">important thing in a really crucial</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.980" end="00:40:50.460" style="s2">component to this whole discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.020" end="00:40:52.380" style="s2">luck and skill and outcomes that we see</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.460" end="00:40:54.300" style="s2">in the world yeah very good i fact that</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.380" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">Schiller&#39;s books on my stack soon to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.300" end="00:40:58.530" style="s2">read and then you&#39;re absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">outcome bias if you&#39;re not subject to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.530" end="00:41:04.830" style="s2">is a wonderful tool in the poker world</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:06.210" style="s2">or hey you see i&#39;m full hit on you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.830" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">a bad decision</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.210" end="00:41:10.590" style="s2">and he thinks that&#39;s wonderful for him i</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.600" style="s2">just sit back and rub my hands okay this</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.590" end="00:41:14.820" style="s2">is a bias to be mine for the next couple</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.600" end="00:41:17.400" style="s2">of hours and of course to do that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.820" end="00:41:19.410" style="s2">have to be very level-headed and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.400" end="00:41:21.780" style="s2">know i don&#39;t mind losing the right way</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.410" end="00:41:23.970" style="s2">in poker i made the right play I lost</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.780" end="00:41:27.180" style="s2">right can I tell story at Jim Ross story</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:43.470" style="s2">listening there I&#39;m I&#39;m just an awesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.370" end="00:41:44.670" style="s2">presentation so fascinating and one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.470" end="00:41:46.170" style="s2">the stories and correct me if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.670" end="00:41:47.910" style="s2">have this right but one of the stories I</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.170" end="00:41:50.250" style="s2">believe you told me is that as a younger</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.910" end="00:41:52.200" style="s2">man you you got enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.250" end="00:41:54.450" style="s2">playing poker and learned all about</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.200" end="00:41:56.550" style="s2">tells and the mathematics of the game</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.450" end="00:41:58.590" style="s2">and so forth and by the evenings you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.550" end="00:42:00.510" style="s2">would play and you know as you got you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.590" end="00:42:01.770" style="s2">know you win some lose some but you got</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.510" end="00:42:02.430" style="s2">better and better and you play better</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.770" end="00:42:04.109" style="s2">better player</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.430" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">and then eventually I think it was your</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.109" end="00:42:07.500" style="s2">uncle pulled you aside said Jim you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:09.299" style="s2">you&#39;re smart young man let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.500" end="00:42:11.160" style="s2">give you some advice instead of trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.299" end="00:42:14.789" style="s2">to play better games just look for easy</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.160" end="00:42:16.109" style="s2">games and you know so where your you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.789" end="00:42:18.510" style="s2">know your skills going to be the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.109" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">best in that and the group and I just</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.510" end="00:42:21.779" style="s2">always loved that and so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:23.789" style="s2">wrote a report called looking for easy</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.779" end="00:42:26.099" style="s2">games and I started it with a gym rut</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.789" end="00:42:28.020" style="s2">you know the whole gym rut story and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.099" end="00:42:29.730" style="s2">argument is in investing and in business</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.020" end="00:42:32.099" style="s2">and anything right if you want to win</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.730" end="00:42:35.250" style="s2">one of the things to think about is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.099" end="00:42:36.779" style="s2">game am I playing and am i they am I</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.250" end="00:42:39.180" style="s2">likely to be the smartest guy at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.779" end="00:42:41.039" style="s2">table I had this really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.180" end="00:42:42.599" style="s2">conversation with Annie Duke the poker</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.039" end="00:42:44.910" style="s2">player and she said you know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.599" end="00:42:46.859" style="s2">pro poker player what you do you figure</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.910" end="00:42:48.510" style="s2">out kind of your winnings per hour right</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.859" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">so figure out is it worth me plant this</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.510" end="00:42:51.930" style="s2">particular table based on how much money</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:53.670" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna make and being a professional</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.930" end="00:42:55.589" style="s2">poker player is not glamorous right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.670" end="00:42:57.210" style="s2">just you needs sample size and you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.589" end="00:42:59.730" style="s2">your button to see for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.210" end="00:43:01.410" style="s2">so she&#39;s playing you know and she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.730" end="00:43:03.660" style="s2">obviously a very skilled professional</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.410" end="00:43:05.099" style="s2">and she&#39;s figuring out her profit per</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.660" end="00:43:07.619" style="s2">hour and then she looked to another</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.099" end="00:43:09.299" style="s2">table that has lower stakes and she</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.619" end="00:43:11.579" style="s2">figures I&#39;m so much better than those</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.299" end="00:43:13.829" style="s2">players that my profit per hours higher</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.579" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">at the lower stakes table right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.829" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">making less per hand but I&#39;m gonna win</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:19.230" style="s2">many more hands and so she says I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:20.819" style="s2">gonna allocate some my time to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.230" end="00:43:23.309" style="s2">other table and so the other poker purse</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.819" end="00:43:24.900" style="s2">like what&#39;s going or the other people</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.309" end="00:43:26.339" style="s2">watching going like what&#39;s going on why</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.900" end="00:43:27.930" style="s2">is she playing that and she&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.339" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">just because I&#39;m so much better than</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.930" end="00:43:31.589" style="s2">those people I can make more money per</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:34.230" style="s2">hour I just thought that was fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.589" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing so I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.230" end="00:43:38.069" style="s2">this idea of looking for easy games and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.869" style="s2">I relate this back to investing for one</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.069" end="00:43:41.460" style="s2">moment this is really interesting so one</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.869" end="00:43:43.289" style="s2">of the biggest trends in investing as</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.460" end="00:43:45.900" style="s2">you know well is this move toward</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.289" end="00:43:47.789" style="s2">indexing right so so in the in the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.900" end="00:43:49.950" style="s2">10 years literally trillions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.789" end="00:43:52.230" style="s2">have been invested in index funds and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.950" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">ETFs and so forth and that&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.230" end="00:43:56.369" style="s2">been at the expense of active managers</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:57.660" style="s2">so some people go wow the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.369" end="00:43:59.339" style="s2">everybody&#39;s just taking their money away</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.660" end="00:44:01.230" style="s2">that means it&#39;s going to make it easier</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.339" end="00:44:03.690" style="s2">for us active managers less competition</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.230" end="00:44:08.789" style="s2">and my response is it may be the exact</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.690" end="00:44:10.589" style="s2">opposite and here&#39;s the reason investing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.789" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">as in poker and poker the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.589" end="00:44:13.349" style="s2">money that walks in the room and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:14.789" style="s2">money at the beginning of the night and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.349" end="00:44:15.720" style="s2">the money that walks out of the room at</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.789" end="00:44:18.090" style="s2">the end of the night</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.720" end="00:44:20.490" style="s2">same amount it&#39;s just a different hands</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.090" end="00:44:23.910" style="s2">writer in different pockets same is true</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.490" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">for investing right excess returns by</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.910" end="00:44:27.780" style="s2">definition net to zero so for you to win</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:30.510" style="s2">someone else has got to lose right by an</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.780" end="00:44:32.700" style="s2">equivalent amount and so my argument is</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.510" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">if it&#39;s though weak players who are</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.700" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">leaving the poker table and investing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.490" style="s2">and putting their money in the index</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:39.840" style="s2">funds it&#39;s like they&#39;re showing up your</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.490" end="00:44:41.070" style="s2">house on Friday night and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.840" end="00:44:43.140" style="s2">drinking your beer but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.070" end="00:44:44.790" style="s2">putting up any stakes right so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.140" end="00:44:46.710" style="s2">actually want to have the weak players</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.790" end="00:44:48.810" style="s2">at your table for you to may generate</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.710" end="00:44:50.280" style="s2">excess returns so part of it is now</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.810" end="00:44:51.960" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re left looking at other</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.280" end="00:44:53.430" style="s2">sharp card players around the table and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.960" end="00:44:55.140" style="s2">that actually makes your job harder not</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.430" end="00:44:57.720" style="s2">easier so there&#39;s a little provocative</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.140" end="00:44:59.460" style="s2">thought for you which is is all this</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.720" end="00:45:02.040" style="s2">indexing actually making life easier or</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.460" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">harder and if I use the gym rut easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.040" end="00:45:06.690" style="s2">games framework it may be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:09.060" style="s2">my life actually got more difficult not</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.690" end="00:45:11.640" style="s2">easier in that you told the story</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.060" end="00:45:13.740" style="s2">correctly like add a little corollary to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.640" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">it we went out to Vegas for my mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.740" end="00:45:19.170" style="s2">80th birthday unlike me she loves casino</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:20.609" style="s2">games to me I just shake my head go and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.170" end="00:45:22.859" style="s2">I&#39;d rather stick my face in the disc</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.609" end="00:45:24.660" style="s2">sale there then put a quarter in it slot</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.859" end="00:45:26.430" style="s2">machine but I did go down to the poker</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.660" end="00:45:28.290" style="s2">room used all my little cunning</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.430" end="00:45:29.970" style="s2">strategies I went down at two o&#39;clock in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.290" end="00:45:33.000" style="s2">the morning after having had four hours</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.970" end="00:45:35.580" style="s2">of sleep and no alcohol right and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.000" end="00:45:37.650" style="s2">walked around the poker room and just</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.580" end="00:45:39.660" style="s2">assessed each table using my little rule</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.650" end="00:45:41.640" style="s2">of thumb that I use and I picked my</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.660" end="00:45:43.470" style="s2">table that I wanted to sit down at I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.640" end="00:45:45.300" style="s2">went up to the maitre d and said I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.470" end="00:45:46.830" style="s2">like to be on table number seven and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:48.359" style="s2">looked at me and he obviously knew</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.830" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">something and he&#39;d do something that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.359" end="00:45:52.170" style="s2">knew something and he smirked and said</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:57.540" style="s2">there&#39;s an hour and three quarters wait</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.170" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">for that it was clearly the fishpond</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.540" end="00:46:03.930" style="s2">there is no easy arbitrage on that one</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:08.910" style="s2">it that&#39;s not at the Bellagio and as the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.930" end="00:46:10.950" style="s2">end of the World Series approaches let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.910" end="00:46:13.859" style="s2">let&#39;s hop back now from these you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.950" end="00:46:15.810" style="s2">very interesting stories to a great</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.859" end="00:46:18.109" style="s2">tangible story that you tell in the book</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.810" end="00:46:20.040" style="s2">which is the difference between finding</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.109" end="00:46:23.010" style="s2">drafting I think was the word you used</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.040" end="00:46:24.359" style="s2">hunters versus receivers in football</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.010" end="00:46:26.220" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.359" end="00:46:28.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s a great book by cutting Boris</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.220" end="00:46:31.079" style="s2">grace Berg called chasing stars and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.920" end="00:46:32.910" style="s2">the question is and this is also very</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.079" end="00:46:35.009" style="s2">it&#39;s just a fascinating topic in general</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.910" end="00:46:36.329" style="s2">and the question is if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.009" end="00:46:38.279" style="s2">improve the performance of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.329" end="00:46:41.430" style="s2">organization how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.279" end="00:46:44.220" style="s2">and one of the logical things is you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.430" end="00:46:46.859" style="s2">look for a star at another organization</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.220" end="00:46:48.329" style="s2">and you hire them and they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.859" end="00:46:49.799" style="s2">this halo is going to come over and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.329" end="00:46:52.529" style="s2">improve the value that performance of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.799" end="00:46:54.390" style="s2">your organization as well so Grossberg</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.529" end="00:46:57.420" style="s2">studied this in particular it by the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.390" end="00:47:00.210" style="s2">in finance actually was in analysts and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.420" end="00:47:02.759" style="s2">what he found was that these stars</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.210" end="00:47:04.700" style="s2">actually had a substantial degradation</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.759" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">and performance in the new organization</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.700" end="00:47:09.509" style="s2">so chasing stars did not work now one</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:11.130" style="s2">thinks he does not point out which I</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.509" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">would just say is probably a good part</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.130" end="00:47:15.269" style="s2">of this is simple regression toward the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.339" style="s2">mean right which is to say if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.269" end="00:47:19.710" style="s2">a start an organization it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.339" end="00:47:23.279" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been pretty skillful and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.710" end="00:47:26.700" style="s2">really lucky and if luck is gonna sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.279" end="00:47:27.900" style="s2">of not persist there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.700" end="00:47:29.910" style="s2">natural regression toward the mean but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.900" end="00:47:31.049" style="s2">think the point he makes which i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.910" end="00:47:33.089" style="s2">is correct</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.049" end="00:47:35.759" style="s2">is this idea that there tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.089" end="00:47:37.470" style="s2">organizational externalities that often</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.759" end="00:47:39.450" style="s2">people don&#39;t take into consideration so</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.470" end="00:47:41.700" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re a great trader at</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.450" end="00:47:43.349" style="s2">goldman sachs there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.700" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">what&#39;s going on at goldman sachs that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.349" end="00:47:48.630" style="s2">makes you very good at what you do and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:50.549" style="s2">when you go to you know bank X those</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.630" end="00:47:52.049" style="s2">things are not around anymore and hence</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.549" end="00:47:54.539" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be much less effective</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.049" end="00:47:55.829" style="s2">so that&#39;s this idea of chasing stars and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.539" end="00:47:58.950" style="s2">by the way there&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.829" end="00:48:00.329" style="s2">you know GE and the olden days used to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.950" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">be known as sort of one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.329" end="00:48:04.589" style="s2">management training places and and goys</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">burg study there where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.589" end="00:48:09.390" style="s2">couple dozen GE managers who were</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:10.980" style="s2">considered to be really good and about</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.390" end="00:48:12.779" style="s2">half of them went to organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.980" end="00:48:14.489" style="s2">were very much like GE and they did</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.779" end="00:48:16.140" style="s2">really well and then half of them went</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.489" end="00:48:17.759" style="s2">to organizations that were very</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.140" end="00:48:19.890" style="s2">different than GE and they floundered</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.759" end="00:48:21.779" style="s2">and so it was not again it&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.890" end="00:48:24.390" style="s2">of organization being really important</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.779" end="00:48:26.700" style="s2">so going back to punters and wide</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.390" end="00:48:28.049" style="s2">receivers so again how as you want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.700" end="00:48:30.569" style="s2">make your sports team better how do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.049" end="00:48:32.339" style="s2">do this and so what their work found was</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.569" end="00:48:34.680" style="s2">that wide receivers when they went to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.339" end="00:48:36.089" style="s2">new teams did regress a lot they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.680" end="00:48:38.070" style="s2">do as well as they did on their prior</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.089" end="00:48:39.480" style="s2">team now part of this again</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.070" end="00:48:40.920" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just classic regression</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.480" end="00:48:42.600" style="s2">toward the mean but part of this is you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.920" end="00:48:44.220" style="s2">need to learn new schemes you have a new</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.600" end="00:48:45.960" style="s2">quarterback all the stuff you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.220" end="00:48:48.060" style="s2">sort of move up the learning curve and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.960" end="00:48:48.990" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the benefit of all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.060" end="00:48:51.780" style="s2">stuff you knew at your prior</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.990" end="00:48:54.980" style="s2">organization the exception to the rule</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.780" end="00:48:57.840" style="s2">though interestingly was punters and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.980" end="00:48:59.460" style="s2">punters were just in Bowie I think I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.840" end="00:49:00.990" style="s2">suspect this true for field goal kickers</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.460" end="00:49:02.700" style="s2">as well is that they were the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.990" end="00:49:05.850" style="s2">everywhere they went and and the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.700" end="00:49:08.430" style="s2">is that they have very few interaction</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.850" end="00:49:10.710" style="s2">effects right you do need a guy to snap</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.430" end="00:49:11.850" style="s2">the ball to you but that&#39;s basically it</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.710" end="00:49:13.380" style="s2">and there are a lot of guys that can</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.850" end="00:49:16.230" style="s2">snap the ball you know roughly</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.380" end="00:49:18.030" style="s2">equivalent skill and so punting was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.230" end="00:49:19.260" style="s2">same everywhere they went because that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.030" end="00:49:20.910" style="s2">was the one thing where there are almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.260" end="00:49:23.250" style="s2">no interaction effects so that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:25.410" style="s2">strengthen the overall argument of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.250" end="00:49:27.300" style="s2">important is the organization to to my</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.410" end="00:49:29.910" style="s2">success so that&#39;s a really good lesson</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.300" end="00:49:32.280" style="s2">in general is this idea of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.910" end="00:49:35.070" style="s2">skeptical about in quotes hiring stars</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.280" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">as a sure way to lift the performance of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.070" end="00:49:40.170" style="s2">your organization and being</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:42.990" style="s2">insufficiently mindful of the role in</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.170" end="00:49:45.870" style="s2">the externalities organizations and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.990" end="00:49:48.180" style="s2">they influence people&#39;s performance that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.870" end="00:49:50.550" style="s2">that&#39;s really useful and now let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.180" end="00:49:53.880" style="s2">on to the next item you put somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.550" end="00:49:55.560" style="s2">says the most dangerous equation makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.880" end="00:49:57.270" style="s2">the equation that states that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.560" end="00:49:59.700" style="s2">variation of the mean is inversely</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.270" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">proportional to the size of the sample</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.700" end="00:50:03.770" style="s2">and again this is something that drives</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:05.960" style="s2">me crazy in the scientific literature</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.770" end="00:50:08.550" style="s2">especially in the biomedical literature</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.960" end="00:50:09.690" style="s2">even the most rough calculation says</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.550" end="00:50:11.790" style="s2">these people are nuts why are you giving</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.690" end="00:50:13.140" style="s2">me results for the sample size of seven</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.790" end="00:50:14.940" style="s2">I just don&#39;t give a sh it&#39;s all noise</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.140" end="00:50:17.370" style="s2">right could you talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.940" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">the importance of sample size yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.370" end="00:50:19.860" style="s2">we&#39;ll set in the article I&#39;m because</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:21.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a nice little paper on this by a</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.860" end="00:50:22.410" style="s2">statistician at University of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.090" end="00:50:24.570" style="s2">Pennsylvania on this and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.410" end="00:50:26.280" style="s2">incredibly important idea and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.570" end="00:50:27.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a snag that&#39;s captured some</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.280" end="00:50:29.310" style="s2">very smart people all about to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.690" end="00:50:31.770" style="s2">story so this is a key to your point</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.310" end="00:50:34.260" style="s2">which is when when sample sizes are</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.770" end="00:50:35.820" style="s2">small the variance tends to be large and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.260" end="00:50:38.940" style="s2">this is quite intuitive right which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.820" end="00:50:40.980" style="s2">if I flip a coin 10 times and it shows</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.940" end="00:50:43.080" style="s2">up you know you get 7 out of 10 or heads</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.980" end="00:50:44.550" style="s2">or whatever that happens I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.080" end="00:50:46.440" style="s2">something like 12 percent of the time so</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.550" end="00:50:48.870" style="s2">that&#39;s it doesn&#39;t happen frequently but</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.440" end="00:50:50.609" style="s2">it&#39;s not infrequent as well if I flip a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.870" end="00:50:54.119" style="s2">coin</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.609" end="00:50:55.980" style="s2">you know ten thousand times if it&#39;s fit</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.119" end="00:50:58.829" style="s2">if it comes out fifty-one hundred heads</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.980" end="00:51:00.059" style="s2">and 49 under tails that only happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.829" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">about two percent time that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.059" end="00:51:04.619" style="s2">that&#39;s very likely to be a biased client</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.180" style="s2">right so we get confused about sample</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.619" end="00:51:07.710" style="s2">size and the variance is implied by that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.180" end="00:51:09.539" style="s2">so let me tell you that there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.710" end="00:51:11.309" style="s2">story about how that is snags as some</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.539" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">really smart people so the Gates</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.309" end="00:51:14.759" style="s2">Foundation and you know these guys are</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:15.809" style="s2">doing really really trying to do great</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.759" end="00:51:17.279" style="s2">work around the world but the Gates</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.809" end="00:51:19.259" style="s2">Foundation want to improve education</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.279" end="00:51:20.759" style="s2">United States so there&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.259" end="00:51:23.700" style="s2">straightforward way to do this let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.759" end="00:51:25.829" style="s2">find the schools with a high SSAT scores</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.700" end="00:51:27.779" style="s2">right we&#39;re gonna look at schools are</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.829" end="00:51:29.579" style="s2">really the kids are really doing well</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.779" end="00:51:31.619" style="s2">and so they find the kids with a high</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.579" end="00:51:34.079" style="s2">safety scores and it turns out these are</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.619" end="00:51:35.430" style="s2">small schools now we&#39;re gonna come back</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.079" end="00:51:36.989" style="s2">to this because you notice they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.430" end="00:51:39.089" style="s2">asked a question another question that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.989" end="00:51:41.160" style="s2">they should have asked and so they go on</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.089" end="00:51:44.430" style="s2">a campaign spending millions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.160" end="00:51:46.380" style="s2">to break up schools to be smaller</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.430" end="00:51:47.789" style="s2">because they&#39;ve deemed them to be more</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.380" end="00:51:51.450" style="s2">effective in fact there was a school in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.789" end="00:51:54.809" style="s2">Seattle near Microsoft that they broke</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.450" end="00:51:57.480" style="s2">into six little mini schools in order to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.809" end="00:51:59.249" style="s2">take advantage of this idea well what</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.480" end="00:52:00.749" style="s2">was the question they didn&#39;t ask Jim the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.249" end="00:52:05.670" style="s2">question they didn&#39;t ask is which</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.749" end="00:52:08.819" style="s2">schools have the worst SAT scores it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.670" end="00:52:10.799" style="s2">small schools right and because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.819" end="00:52:12.329" style="s2">just capturing the tails of the variance</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.799" end="00:52:14.369" style="s2">right because of the small sample size</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.329" end="00:52:16.499" style="s2">the number of students and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.369" end="00:52:18.180" style="s2">look at the full distribution you start</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.499" end="00:52:20.279" style="s2">to see a very different picture and this</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.180" end="00:52:22.380" style="s2">idea of small schools in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.279" end="00:52:24.059" style="s2">is not the correct answer at all and in</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.380" end="00:52:26.309" style="s2">fact there and then when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.059" end="00:52:27.720" style="s2">it right larger schools have advantages</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.309" end="00:52:30.329" style="s2">like if there are a number of kids that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.720" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">can take you know fancy AP courses and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.329" end="00:52:34.109" style="s2">you know calculus or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:35.819" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a much larger and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.109" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">larger population of kids it would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.819" end="00:52:39.420" style="s2">avail themselves of that kind of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:41.160" style="s2">then you wouldn&#39;t a small school so</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.420" end="00:52:42.390" style="s2">that&#39;s just it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.160" end="00:52:44.099" style="s2">thing and I&#39;ll just say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.390" end="00:52:45.660" style="s2">psychologically it&#39;s this is really</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.099" end="00:52:48.630" style="s2">important is that when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.660" end="00:52:53.130" style="s2">biases that we have we tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.630" end="00:52:55.950" style="s2">overconfident when we see small samples</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.130" end="00:52:57.359" style="s2">with strong signals right going back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.950" end="00:52:59.099" style="s2">my coin toss thing when you see seven</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:00.839" style="s2">heads and ten tails you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.099" end="00:53:03.239" style="s2">over conference that it&#39;s a biased coin</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.839" end="00:53:03.930" style="s2">and you don&#39;t you don&#39;t take into</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.239" end="00:53:05.160" style="s2">consideration</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.930" end="00:53:08.610" style="s2">the strength of the signal which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.160" end="00:53:10.920" style="s2">really sample size by contrast when we</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.610" end="00:53:14.580" style="s2">have very weak signals like sono they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.920" end="00:53:17.370" style="s2">my 51% heads with 10,000 tosses but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.580" end="00:53:20.040" style="s2">have such large sample size we are under</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.370" end="00:53:22.680" style="s2">confident that that is biased when in</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.040" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">case a that is very unlikely to be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.680" end="00:53:25.980" style="s2">biased coin in case B it&#39;s very likely</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:28.350" style="s2">to be bi so that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.980" end="00:53:30.090" style="s2">setup for us psychologically and by the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.350" end="00:53:31.530" style="s2">way Kahneman and Tversky talked about</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.090" end="00:53:33.450" style="s2">this in their classic stuff is that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.530" end="00:53:35.100" style="s2">use small numbers and extrapolate in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.450" end="00:53:37.140" style="s2">way that&#39;s inappropriate so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.100" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">incredibly important life lesson and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.140" end="00:53:41.580" style="s2">again as you put it out in your setup I</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:43.710" style="s2">mean you look around the world whether</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.580" end="00:53:46.050" style="s2">it&#39;s medicine but it&#39;s business if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.710" end="00:53:48.810" style="s2">see all the time that people take small</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.050" end="00:53:50.820" style="s2">sample sizes and extrapolate related</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.810" end="00:53:52.200" style="s2">concept is recency bias you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.820" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">the but by the way you see this in crazy</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.200" end="00:53:56.580" style="s2">places where people should know better a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:58.710" style="s2">baseball player has a great season or</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.580" end="00:54:00.660" style="s2">even a great few months before the end</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.710" end="00:54:02.340" style="s2">of the season and all of a sudden his</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.660" end="00:54:04.560" style="s2">stock goes up and he can sign a more</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.340" end="00:54:06.210" style="s2">lucrative contract then he would have</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.560" end="00:54:08.010" style="s2">otherwise and it makes no sense but</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.210" end="00:54:09.150" style="s2">people fall for this recency bias all</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.010" end="00:54:11.490" style="s2">the time so you just really want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.150" end="00:54:16.010" style="s2">think about sample size and how reliable</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.490" end="00:54:19.020" style="s2">are your results in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.010" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">longer term performance yeah this has</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.020" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">some huge social political implications</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.110" end="00:54:27.690" style="s2">and perhaps even world history effects</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">you know the u.s. we spend 3040 million</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.690" end="00:54:33.450" style="s2">dollars at the National Institutes for</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.430" end="00:54:35.190" style="s2">health and for various institutionalist</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.450" end="00:54:37.050" style="s2">reasons basically because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.190" end="00:54:39.120" style="s2">million biomedical researchers with</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.050" end="00:54:43.710" style="s2">their hands out looking for money in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.120" end="00:54:46.260" style="s2">US we tend to fund maybe barely possibly</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.710" end="00:54:48.840" style="s2">adequate sample sizes for biomedical</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.260" end="00:54:52.500" style="s2">research but when you add in the noise</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.840" end="00:54:54.030" style="s2">from mistakes of experimental design the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.500" end="00:54:54.900" style="s2">reality there&#39;s an awful lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.030" end="00:54:56.760" style="s2">just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.900" end="00:54:58.620" style="s2">for instance god we had on this show</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.760" end="00:55:01.410" style="s2">Brian Nozick of the Center for open</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.620" end="00:55:03.420" style="s2">science he was also the guy who started</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.420" end="00:55:08.550" style="s2">ecology right went try to replicate a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.880" end="00:55:11.370" style="s2">bunch of psychology experiments in top</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.550" end="00:55:14.310" style="s2">publications and only about 35% of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.370" end="00:55:16.500" style="s2">replicated and while in China for</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.310" end="00:55:17.900" style="s2">instance in biomedical they have chosen</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.500" end="00:55:19.309" style="s2">to take another</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.900" end="00:55:21.140" style="s2">approach probably because their number</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.309" end="00:55:23.180" style="s2">researchers wasn&#39;t is large when they</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.140" end="00:55:25.640" style="s2">started doing this is instead of having</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.180" end="00:55:27.740" style="s2">a sample size of 40 or 50 they&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.640" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">sample size of a thousand which means</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.740" end="00:55:31.849" style="s2">that they&#39;ll do less numbers of studies</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:34.730" style="s2">but that the value of the information</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.849" end="00:55:38.359" style="s2">from each study is much more valuable</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.730" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">and I suspect if the United States could</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.359" end="00:55:43.069" style="s2">learn that discipline our large amount</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:44.809" style="s2">of money spent in federal research would</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.069" end="00:55:46.309" style="s2">be better spent yeah I&#39;m with you</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.809" end="00:55:48.920" style="s2">hundred percent and these are fairly</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.309" end="00:55:51.079" style="s2">basic ideas but remarkably still not</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.920" end="00:55:52.940" style="s2">well viscous and incentives and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.079" end="00:55:54.950" style="s2">psychology and so forth but yeah an</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.940" end="00:55:56.599" style="s2">institutional bias that&#39;s right you got</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.950" end="00:55:58.579" style="s2">all them researchers out there with</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.599" end="00:56:01.549" style="s2">their hands out and nobody wants to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.579" end="00:56:03.680" style="s2">no right exactly indeed let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.549" end="00:56:05.240" style="s2">a couple other interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.680" end="00:56:08.210" style="s2">findings that you&#39;ve talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.240" end="00:56:09.829" style="s2">book one I thought again it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.210" end="00:56:11.539" style="s2">informed by all these things we talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.829" end="00:56:14.599" style="s2">about is what you call the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.539" end="00:56:17.630" style="s2">quotient versus the rationality quotient</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.599" end="00:56:22.490" style="s2">why smart people do dumb things right</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.630" end="00:56:24.260" style="s2">I&#39;m personally a fine example by the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.490" end="00:56:26.089" style="s2">there&#39;s another topic I love Jim I just</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.260" end="00:56:28.309" style="s2">this is so fascinating to me so this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.089" end="00:56:29.480" style="s2">work done by a retired professor at</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.309" end="00:56:31.069" style="s2">University of Toronto named Keith</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.480" end="00:56:34.460" style="s2">Stanovich he wrote a book ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.069" end="00:56:37.309" style="s2">called what intelligence tests miss and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.460" end="00:56:40.339" style="s2">the core are very provocative claim is</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.309" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">that IQ measure something this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.339" end="00:56:43.220" style="s2">controversial by the way but it measure</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:45.109" style="s2">something he claims there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.220" end="00:56:46.700" style="s2">real something you know some we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.109" end="00:56:48.740" style="s2">measure and more of it tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.700" end="00:56:50.059" style="s2">better than less of it but that should</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.740" end="00:56:51.859" style="s2">be distinguished from what he calls our</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.059" end="00:56:53.569" style="s2">cue rationality quotient which is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.859" end="00:56:55.430" style="s2">ability to make a decision and again his</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.569" end="00:56:58.520" style="s2">core claim is these are only partially</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.430" end="00:57:00.049" style="s2">overlapping skills so you might even</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.520" end="00:57:02.599" style="s2">think about them as different sliders</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.049" end="00:57:05.329" style="s2">and by the way we don&#39;t test for our cue</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.599" end="00:57:06.829" style="s2">by and large and so his argument is we</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.329" end="00:57:08.390" style="s2">all know that&#39;s people that do great in</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.829" end="00:57:09.710" style="s2">school that really book smart but they</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.390" end="00:57:11.809" style="s2">can&#39;t make decisions in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.710" end="00:57:13.549" style="s2">very effectively and other people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.809" end="00:57:15.740" style="s2">are not geniuses but really make good</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.549" end="00:57:17.809" style="s2">decisions day and day out so that would</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.740" end="00:57:21.500" style="s2">be indications of the differences on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.809" end="00:57:23.180" style="s2">IQ vs. RQ sliders so this is I think a</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.500" end="00:57:25.369" style="s2">really interesting idea and by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.180" end="00:57:26.230" style="s2">think this idea of RQ is really central</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.369" end="00:57:28.329" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.230" end="00:57:31.150" style="s2">certainly a great investor but probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.329" end="00:57:32.349" style="s2">a great business person as well so he</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.150" end="00:57:34.930" style="s2">went out and got a million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.349" end="00:57:36.940" style="s2">Templeton grant to develop what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.930" end="00:57:39.700" style="s2">the comprehensive assessment of rational</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.940" end="00:57:42.250" style="s2">thinking cart which is akin to an IQ</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.700" end="00:57:44.380" style="s2">test and he wrote a book a couple years</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.250" end="00:57:46.450" style="s2">ago about this which laid out</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.380" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">essentially the the skeleton framework</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.450" end="00:57:49.750" style="s2">of this comprehensive assessment</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:52.780" style="s2">rational thinking and it&#39;s totally cool</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.750" end="00:57:54.430" style="s2">and it is not yet they&#39;re still using</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.780" end="00:57:56.800" style="s2">only in academic settings but I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.430" end="00:58:00.300" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredibly interesting framework</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.800" end="00:58:03.190" style="s2">and you know it tests things like logic</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.300" end="00:58:05.260" style="s2">numeracy often people do well don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.190" end="00:58:07.570" style="s2">believe in things like fate and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.260" end="00:58:10.359" style="s2">so I just think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.570" end="00:58:12.760" style="s2">interesting area in psychology that will</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.359" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">continue to be explored and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.760" end="00:58:16.630" style="s2">lot of practical implications now I</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:18.790" style="s2">mention one of the things out as a side</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.630" end="00:58:20.470" style="s2">note this is just my belief on this and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.790" end="00:58:24.579" style="s2">by the way I guess it should be more</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.470" end="00:58:26.170" style="s2">clear so the key to our cue is is two</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.579" end="00:58:27.940" style="s2">things and we&#39;ll use some fancy language</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.170" end="00:58:30.040" style="s2">right one is instrumental rationality</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.940" end="00:58:31.540" style="s2">which is you can achieve your objectives</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.040" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">given your constraints and the classic</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.540" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">way we think about that in economics is</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:37.810" style="s2">the axioms utility theory but the second</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:39.730" style="s2">dimension is one much more important</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.810" end="00:58:42.390" style="s2">which is epistemic rationality which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.730" end="00:58:46.030" style="s2">a fancy way of saying your beliefs map</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.390" end="00:58:47.470" style="s2">accurately to the world and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.030" end="00:58:48.940" style="s2">easy right because the world changes</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.470" end="00:58:50.770" style="s2">right especially in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.940" end="00:58:53.020" style="s2">business or investing the world changes</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.770" end="00:58:55.300" style="s2">so one of the keys is to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.020" end="00:58:57.849" style="s2">Bayesian and update your views as the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.300" end="00:58:59.770" style="s2">world changes in front of you so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.849" end="00:59:01.780" style="s2">of this also is things like calibration</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.770" end="00:59:03.550" style="s2">that you&#39;re well calibrated that when</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.780" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">you say something can happen with a 70%</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.550" end="00:59:08.530" style="s2">probability on average it happens 70% of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:10.660" style="s2">time so the other link I&#39;ll make which I</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.530" end="00:59:11.890" style="s2">love is there&#39;s a book and I&#39;m a big fan</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.660" end="00:59:14.020" style="s2">of both these guys but there&#39;s a book by</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.890" end="00:59:15.880" style="s2">Phil tetlock called super forecasters</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.020" end="00:59:18.460" style="s2">you&#39;re probably familiar with it where</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.880" end="00:59:20.140" style="s2">they did a forecasting tournament and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.460" end="00:59:22.000" style="s2">was open and thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.140" end="00:59:24.550" style="s2">participated and what they found was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:26.470" style="s2">small sliver of that population 2% were</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.550" end="00:59:28.119" style="s2">they were so-called super forecasters</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.470" end="00:59:30.400" style="s2">and these are people making very good</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.119" end="00:59:31.750" style="s2">forecasts that were persistently way</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.400" end="00:59:33.250" style="s2">beyond what chance would dictate by the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.750" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">way they tested obviously for just luck</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.250" end="00:59:38.140" style="s2">and they actually asked they some people</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:39.540" style="s2">in control they gave training others who</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.140" end="00:59:40.980" style="s2">didn&#39;t but they did they did</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.540" end="00:59:43.830" style="s2">personality profiles of all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.980" end="00:59:46.020" style="s2">forecasters and they created came up</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.830" end="00:59:47.880" style="s2">with a sort of a modal sort of mortal</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.020" end="00:59:49.740" style="s2">characteristics of a super forecaster</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.880" end="00:59:50.790" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna circle back to things we</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.740" end="00:59:52.680" style="s2">talked about the very beginning these</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.790" end="00:59:55.560" style="s2">are people who were actively open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.680" end="00:59:57.990" style="s2">but it turns out I think that the skills</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.560" end="01:00:00.780" style="s2">they had overlap almost perfectly with</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.990" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">that of the arc you test right so</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.780" end="01:00:04.650" style="s2">they&#39;re just people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:06.870" style="s2">change their mind they&#39;re open to new</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.650" end="01:00:09.000" style="s2">information and in fact the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.870" end="01:00:10.680" style="s2">correlates best with everything is John</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.000" end="01:00:12.960" style="s2">and John Baran&#39;s idea of actively</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.680" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">open-minded which means not only willing</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.960" end="01:00:16.230" style="s2">to entertain points of view they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:18.690" style="s2">different than what you believe you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.230" end="01:00:20.910" style="s2">actively seek them which by the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.690" end="01:00:23.340" style="s2">takes a lot of cognitive energy to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.910" end="01:00:24.750" style="s2">the right I mean most of us just have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.340" end="01:00:26.220" style="s2">point of view want something once we</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.750" end="01:00:27.810" style="s2">decided on it we just want to stick with</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.220" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">what we believe and never change our</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.810" end="01:00:33.180" style="s2">view by the way I&#39;ll just say I&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:35.070" style="s2">two when I work out in the in the gym I</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.180" end="01:00:38.580" style="s2">often watch television and I now take</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.070" end="01:00:40.560" style="s2">into the habit of watching CNN for half</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.580" end="01:00:42.390" style="s2">the time and watching Fox News the other</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.560" end="01:00:44.460" style="s2">half of the time just to see how the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.390" end="01:00:46.740" style="s2">world works and it&#39;s a fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.460" end="01:00:48.810" style="s2">exercise right because people will be</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.740" end="01:00:50.340" style="s2">talking about the same topic but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.810" end="01:00:52.680" style="s2">very different points of view and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.340" end="01:00:53.880" style="s2">it is it&#39;s definitely I in mind opening</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.680" end="01:00:56.370" style="s2">just to see different points of view so</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.880" end="01:00:57.660" style="s2">I love this IQ versus rqi I would put</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.370" end="01:00:59.550" style="s2">this on the lookout because I think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.660" end="01:01:03.210" style="s2">this is something that could very well</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.550" end="01:01:05.430" style="s2">become more more mainstream and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.210" end="01:01:07.320" style="s2">for people it&#39;s just a great that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.430" end="01:01:09.930" style="s2">great way of thinking about assessing</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.320" end="01:01:11.670" style="s2">other people&#39;s capabilities beyond just</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.930" end="01:01:13.800" style="s2">you went to MIT so you&#39;re super smart</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.670" end="01:01:15.960" style="s2">guy absolutely and that&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.800" end="01:01:19.580" style="s2">learned in the business world relatively</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.960" end="01:01:22.110" style="s2">quickly is yes the credentials are</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.580" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">interesting and are useful filter but</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.110" end="01:01:26.220" style="s2">don&#39;t let them over filter but things I</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:28.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the terminology but</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.220" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">something like the RQ is actually more</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.860" end="01:01:33.360" style="s2">important in the long run it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:34.980" style="s2">interestingly you mentioned tetlock that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.360" end="01:01:36.660" style="s2">was going to be next up on my questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.980" end="01:01:38.520" style="s2">and while you talked about what he found</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.660" end="01:01:39.840" style="s2">in his super forecasters you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.520" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">touch on the part that I thought that</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.840" end="01:01:44.220" style="s2">was so interesting is that in you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.480" end="01:01:46.080" style="s2">field after field after field his</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.220" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">research showed that you know most</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.080" end="01:01:50.730" style="s2">people for casting behaviors of complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:53.370" style="s2">systems just plain suck at it right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.730" end="01:01:57.330" style="s2">a matrix yeah and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.370" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">met Phil back probably 2006 or so and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.330" end="01:02:00.870" style="s2">wrote a book very much for your point</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:02.880" style="s2">called expert political judgement so</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.870" end="01:02:03.750" style="s2">Phil&#39;s a psychologist by training he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">now at the University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.750" end="01:02:07.980" style="s2">and he but he&#39;s very should know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:09.480" style="s2">been very tuned political science and as</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.980" end="01:02:10.500" style="s2">he tells the story it was hanging out</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.480" end="01:02:12.210" style="s2">with a bunch of political scientists</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.500" end="01:02:13.890" style="s2">back in the 1980s and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.210" end="01:02:15.720" style="s2">pontificating about different things and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.890" end="01:02:17.010" style="s2">he wondered to himself legs anybody have</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.720" end="01:02:19.170" style="s2">to keep track what these guys say and</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.010" end="01:02:20.580" style="s2">the answer was pretty much no so he</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.170" end="01:02:22.680" style="s2">embarked on what end up being a twenty</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.580" end="01:02:24.450" style="s2">plus year study of expert forecasts and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.680" end="01:02:25.740" style="s2">is very much viewpoint it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.450" end="01:02:27.630" style="s2">political economic and social outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.740" end="01:02:30.600" style="s2">so these were their sort of canonical</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.630" end="01:02:32.490" style="s2">complex systems and these are these are</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.600" end="01:02:34.170" style="s2">experts right these are masters PhD</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.490" end="01:02:35.820" style="s2">level people and he asked them to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.170" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">very specific probabilistic predictions</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.820" end="01:02:38.780" style="s2">and they did something very unusual</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:40.680" style="s2">which is actually kept track of them and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.780" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">the results are very much what you</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.680" end="01:02:43.980" style="s2">described is they&#39;re very bad at this in</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:45.660" style="s2">fact you know simple extrapolation</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.980" end="01:02:48.300" style="s2">algorithms tend to do as well or better</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.660" end="01:02:49.320" style="s2">and very many of them don&#39;t do it much</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.300" end="01:02:50.580" style="s2">better than chance the other thing I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.320" end="01:02:51.690" style="s2">just remark about these experts is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.580" end="01:02:52.860" style="s2">they&#39;re just like you and me when they</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.690" end="01:02:55.230" style="s2">get something wrong and they have all</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.860" end="01:02:56.940" style="s2">litany of excuses as to why they they</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.230" end="01:02:59.670" style="s2">got it wrong you know I you know you</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.940" end="01:03:01.890" style="s2">just wait or or I almost got that right</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.670" end="01:03:05.570" style="s2">my favorites used by the way it was my</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.890" end="01:03:05.570" style="s2">forecast was so important to change the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.780" end="01:03:14.010" style="s2">car too often but um but this is this</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.090" end="01:03:14.940" style="s2">actually an important point that and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.010" end="01:03:16.800" style="s2">think this you know we had that</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.940" end="01:03:18.810" style="s2">symposium on complexity economics a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.800" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">couple of weeks ago testify and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.810" end="01:03:21.930" style="s2">that many of these kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:25.230" style="s2">about expertise for instance really are</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.930" end="01:03:27.240" style="s2">incredibly domain-specific and so there</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.230" end="01:03:28.800" style="s2">are areas where experts actually are</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.240" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">really good and they tend to agree in</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.800" end="01:03:32.460" style="s2">fact in my book think twice I have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:33.990" style="s2">chapter called the expert squeeze and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.460" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">discuss where experts are likely to</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.990" end="01:03:36.750" style="s2">continue to be important and where</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:39.180" style="s2">they&#39;re not and so look if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.750" end="01:03:41.130" style="s2">tricky math problem or or you need your</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.180" end="01:03:42.630" style="s2">plumbing fix or something you know there</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.130" end="01:03:43.890" style="s2">are going to be expert you can call them</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.630" end="01:03:45.420" style="s2">that can do that and the results are</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.890" end="01:03:46.680" style="s2">going to be consistent with one another</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.420" end="01:03:48.630" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna agree for the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.680" end="01:03:50.250" style="s2">part but when you get into complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.630" end="01:03:52.680" style="s2">systems as you point out predicting</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.250" end="01:03:55.950" style="s2">markets or oil prices or geopolitical</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.680" end="01:03:59.490" style="s2">outcomes it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit of it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.950" end="01:04:01.350" style="s2">complex systems Wild West and there you</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.490" end="01:04:03.150" style="s2">will find experts as you as you point</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.350" end="01:04:04.500" style="s2">out equally credentialed who will come</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.150" end="01:04:06.210" style="s2">up with diametrically opposite</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.500" end="01:04:06.760" style="s2">conclusions you know oil prices are</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.210" end="01:04:10.210" style="s2">going to sky</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.760" end="01:04:11.770" style="s2">oil prices gonna plummet and there we</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.210" end="01:04:14.080" style="s2">know their track records really poor so</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.770" end="01:04:15.220" style="s2">part of part of my thing is to say and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.080" end="01:04:17.560" style="s2">and by the way the other thing I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.220" end="01:04:20.350" style="s2">say that we know psychologically we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.560" end="01:04:22.360" style="s2">love to defer to experts you know why do</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.350" end="01:04:24.190" style="s2">we have the Talking Heads on CNBC every</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.360" end="01:04:25.840" style="s2">days cuz those people are really we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.190" end="01:04:27.100" style="s2">love to listen to them and we love to</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.840" end="01:04:28.840" style="s2">think that they know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.100" end="01:04:31.110" style="s2">talking about right so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.840" end="01:04:33.670" style="s2">something enduring about our desire to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.110" end="01:04:36.940" style="s2">listen to the fortune teller to some</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.670" end="01:04:38.530" style="s2">degree so my whole thing is be super</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.940" end="01:04:40.870" style="s2">sensitive to the domain that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.530" end="01:04:42.580" style="s2">thinking about and to recognize and in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.870" end="01:04:43.930" style="s2">some domains experts are absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.580" end="01:04:45.490" style="s2">going to be great and they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.930" end="01:04:48.040" style="s2">useful and you&#39;re gonna want to defer to</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.490" end="01:04:50.170" style="s2">them but you can&#39;t extrapolate the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.040" end="01:04:52.420" style="s2">abilities in some domains and into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.170" end="01:04:55.180" style="s2">complex systems world because it just</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.420" end="01:04:56.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and and again your mind is</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.180" end="01:04:58.870" style="s2">gonna want to believe but you should</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.650" end="01:05:00.490" style="s2">suspend that and and that belief and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.870" end="01:05:02.500" style="s2">recognize that no one knows what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.490" end="01:05:04.000" style="s2">heck is going on so so tight locks work</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.500" end="01:05:05.620" style="s2">I think the first thing was and but</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.000" end="01:05:08.170" style="s2">unbowed I think he&#39;s a very thoughtful</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.620" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">guy so even even there were some silver</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.170" end="01:05:12.310" style="s2">linings and in the original work on</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:13.420" style="s2">expert political judgment but to</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.310" end="01:05:16.240" style="s2">recognize that there are very few</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.420" end="01:05:18.070" style="s2">experts that can predict well now I will</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.240" end="01:05:19.540" style="s2">say one thing Jim this goes also back to</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.070" end="01:05:21.400" style="s2">our conversation about the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.540" end="01:05:22.840" style="s2">Institute I thought one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.400" end="01:05:24.250" style="s2">remarkable there are two remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.840" end="01:05:27.130" style="s2">things that were in Ted Locke&#39;s findings</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.250" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">that were significant one was I love</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.130" end="01:05:31.570" style="s2">this the more media mentions a pundit</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.870" style="s2">had the worst his or her predictions</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.570" end="01:05:36.490" style="s2">were one way the people you hear and see</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.870" end="01:05:38.230" style="s2">the most frequently are though worse</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.490" end="01:05:40.270" style="s2">when you actually objectively keep track</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.230" end="01:05:42.520" style="s2">of their record now part of that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.270" end="01:05:44.740" style="s2">because if you&#39;re in the media so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.520" end="01:05:47.350" style="s2">a producer for a TV show or you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.740" end="01:05:48.820" style="s2">editor of a newspaper you kind of want</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.350" end="01:05:50.620" style="s2">to have people to have kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.820" end="01:05:52.990" style="s2">views of the world right you want boom</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.620" end="01:05:55.830" style="s2">stirs and do stirs to be on your your</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.990" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">talk show in order to generate interest</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.830" end="01:06:01.330" style="s2">but the second thing he found was that</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:03.220" style="s2">what predicted success of forecasting</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.330" end="01:06:05.710" style="s2">had less to do with your gender or age</p>

<p begin="01:06:05.710" end="01:06:08.500" style="s2">with your way of thinking so he</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.060" end="01:06:11.530" style="s2">hearkened back to the famous Isaiah</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.500" end="01:06:13.000" style="s2">Berlin essay on foxes vs. hedgehogs so</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.530" end="01:06:15.070" style="s2">hedgehogs are those people that know one</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.000" end="01:06:16.450" style="s2">big thing and pretty much anything you</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.070" end="01:06:18.070" style="s2">chuck at them they&#39;re gonna pound into</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.450" end="01:06:19.550" style="s2">their worldview one way or another we</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.070" end="01:06:22.410" style="s2">all know the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.550" end="01:06:23.610" style="s2">and the other the contrast is the foxes</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.410" end="01:06:24.930" style="s2">or these are people know a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.610" end="01:06:27.000" style="s2">about a lot of different things they</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.930" end="01:06:29.640" style="s2">tend to hold their views lightly and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.000" end="01:06:31.110" style="s2">their constant learners and they tend</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.640" end="01:06:33.600" style="s2">not to be too wedded to any particular</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.110" end="01:06:36.990" style="s2">point of view and and I think for me at</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.600" end="01:06:40.890" style="s2">least I think that SFI tends to be the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.990" end="01:06:42.840" style="s2">kind of place that draws foxes which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.890" end="01:06:44.430" style="s2">always super fun and what tetlock found</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.840" end="01:06:47.100" style="s2">was hedgehogs will have their 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.430" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">of fame so if your boom stir or doom</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.100" end="01:06:49.830" style="s2">stir and the market goes up a lot or</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:51.780" style="s2">down a lot you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.830" end="01:06:54.090" style="s2">be in the spotlight for a moment but</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.780" end="01:06:57.060" style="s2">over time it&#39;s the foxes it tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.090" end="01:06:59.280" style="s2">better forecasters because they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.060" end="01:07:00.930" style="s2">malleable cognitively malleable and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">as new information comes in they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.930" end="01:07:04.830" style="s2">actually update their views in both the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:07.260" style="s2">direction and magnitude that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.830" end="01:07:08.550" style="s2">so I love all that stuff I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.260" end="01:07:10.590" style="s2">really important again I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.550" end="01:07:12.780" style="s2">temperamentally some some people are</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.590" end="01:07:14.790" style="s2">better at it than others but all these</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.780" end="01:07:17.100" style="s2">things and I should have said this about</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.790" end="01:07:19.710" style="s2">our queue I think it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.100" end="01:07:21.480" style="s2">difficult to change people&#39;s IQs that</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.710" end="01:07:23.550" style="s2">much but but there are some I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.480" end="01:07:24.960" style="s2">reasonably convincing evidence that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.550" end="01:07:27.060" style="s2">our queue something you can cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.960" end="01:07:30.359" style="s2">both as an individual and even as an</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.060" end="01:07:31.859" style="s2">organization and this idea being Foxy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.359" end="01:07:34.830" style="s2">also something you probably can</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.859" end="01:07:36.869" style="s2">cultivate as an individual and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.830" end="01:07:38.730" style="s2">that sort of an encouraging note right</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.869" end="01:07:40.440" style="s2">at the end that this is really difficult</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.730" end="01:07:42.720" style="s2">but we can probably do better than we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.440" end="01:07:45.030" style="s2">doing indeed let&#39;s go on to another</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.720" end="01:07:47.220" style="s2">topic and this is something at one level</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.030" end="01:07:48.600" style="s2">once I read it and thought about it said</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.220" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">sure of course that&#39;s intuitively</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.600" end="01:07:53.220" style="s2">obvious but it&#39;s an idea I had never</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:55.080" style="s2">come across before I think it&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.220" end="01:07:57.330" style="s2">useful for people to add to their</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.080" end="01:07:59.430" style="s2">intellectual toolkits and that is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.330" end="01:08:02.010" style="s2">you point out and give some examples</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.430" end="01:08:04.830" style="s2">that when skill starts to converge in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.010" end="01:08:07.560" style="s2">domain luck actually becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.830" end="01:08:09.270" style="s2">important because you knock that a</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.560" end="01:08:11.310" style="s2">little bit Jim these are all the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.270" end="01:08:12.990" style="s2">fun topics yeah so this is I want to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.310" end="01:08:15.960" style="s2">that I learned this originally from</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.990" end="01:08:18.359" style="s2">Stephen Jay Gould who wrote a book</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.960" end="01:08:20.279" style="s2">called full house in the mid-1990s and</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.359" end="01:08:23.850" style="s2">in the end full house is really about</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.279" end="01:08:25.680" style="s2">this idea of distributions I gave it the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.850" end="01:08:27.270" style="s2">name the paradox of skill but I want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.680" end="01:08:28.799" style="s2">be very clear that I got that idea from</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.270" end="01:08:29.830" style="s2">Gould and I&#39;m sure Gould may have gotten</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.799" end="01:08:31.990" style="s2">this from someone else</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.830" end="01:08:34.330" style="s2">and just to rephrase what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.990" end="01:08:36.070" style="s2">the idea the core idea is that in</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.330" end="01:08:37.690" style="s2">activities we&#39;re both skill and luck</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.070" end="01:08:39.520" style="s2">contribute to outcomes which is most</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.690" end="01:08:42.370" style="s2">things of course that it can be this</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.520" end="01:08:43.960" style="s2">case that a skill increases luck becomes</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.370" end="01:08:46.540" style="s2">more important and that seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.960" end="01:08:48.609" style="s2">really weird finding and the key insight</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.540" end="01:08:51.010" style="s2">to this and as you said once you explain</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.609" end="01:08:52.270" style="s2">it it becomes extremely intuitive the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.010" end="01:08:54.310" style="s2">key insight is you have to think about</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.270" end="01:08:57.880" style="s2">skill in two dimensions the first</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.310" end="01:08:59.290" style="s2">dimension is absolute skill and I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.880" end="01:09:00.700" style="s2">that we would all agree if you look</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.290" end="01:09:04.240" style="s2">around the world whether it&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.700" end="01:09:05.920" style="s2">or sports or investing or anything the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.240" end="01:09:07.870" style="s2">level of absolute skills never been</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.920" end="01:09:09.190" style="s2">higher than it is today what which by</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.870" end="01:09:11.070" style="s2">the way you would expect because of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.190" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">cumulative human knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.070" end="01:09:15.430" style="s2">technology and so on and so forth so you</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:17.980" style="s2">know to be concrete if I put you as an</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.430" end="01:09:21.220" style="s2">investor if I put you back in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.980" end="01:09:22.780" style="s2">with the tools at your fingertips today</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.220" end="01:09:24.130" style="s2">you could run circles around your</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.780" end="01:09:26.230" style="s2">competition right you&#39;d simply have</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.130" end="01:09:28.839" style="s2">better information faster trading and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.230" end="01:09:31.060" style="s2">on so forth and we see this by the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.839" end="01:09:33.580" style="s2">in sports especially things measured</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.060" end="01:09:35.109" style="s2">versus a clock as we know right you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.580" end="01:09:37.720" style="s2">people are constantly setting records</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.109" end="01:09:38.589" style="s2">for the fastest running time or swimming</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.720" end="01:09:40.270" style="s2">time or what have you</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.589" end="01:09:42.160" style="s2">the second dimension though is where it</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.270" end="01:09:44.980" style="s2">gets super interesting and that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.160" end="01:09:46.930" style="s2">relative skill which is the difference</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.980" end="01:09:50.740" style="s2">between the very best and the average</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.930" end="01:09:52.510" style="s2">now Gould introduced this idea with a</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.740" end="01:09:54.940" style="s2">story about Ted Williams Ted Williams</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.510" end="01:09:58.330" style="s2">was last baseball player to hit over 400</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.940" end="01:10:01.870" style="s2">for a season he did that in 1941 and he</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.330" end="01:10:05.080" style="s2">hit 406 and gules asked any question</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.870" end="01:10:07.300" style="s2">like why is no one hit over 400 since</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.080" end="01:10:08.920" style="s2">1941 and he&#39;s like certainly that</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.300" end="01:10:11.620" style="s2">players today are better than they were</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.920" end="01:10:13.450" style="s2">before they trained better that better</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.620" end="01:10:16.090" style="s2">nutrition they better coaching and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.450" end="01:10:18.220" style="s2">forth and his argument was at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.090" end="01:10:21.250" style="s2">the day it turns out that they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.220" end="01:10:24.130" style="s2">uniformly excellent and as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.250" end="01:10:26.500" style="s2">that standard deviation of skill has</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.130" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">gone down so to say this slightly</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.500" end="01:10:30.460" style="s2">differently and a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:33.670" style="s2">technically you can think about batting</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.460" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">averages as a normal distribution the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.670" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">mean is usually around 260 you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:41.710" style="s2">something like that and by the way the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:43.180" style="s2">powers at major league baseball will</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.710" end="01:10:44.830" style="s2">actually change the rules</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.180" end="01:10:46.840" style="s2">have cheese rules over the decades to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.830" end="01:10:48.250" style="s2">make sure that there&#39;s no advantage</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.840" end="01:10:50.260" style="s2">going to the pictures of the hitters</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.250" end="01:10:52.450" style="s2">right so 260 and then you can calculate</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.260" end="01:10:54.070" style="s2">the standard deviation of that around</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.450" end="01:10:57.400" style="s2">that mean and so it turns out that Ted</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.070" end="01:11:00.700" style="s2">Williams was almost exactly a for</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.400" end="01:11:02.650" style="s2">standard deviation event in 1941 right</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.700" end="01:11:04.210" style="s2">which is extremely rare and you would</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.650" end="01:11:05.890" style="s2">just say a lot of luck and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.210" end="01:11:08.140" style="s2">skill right there&#39;s no other way to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.890" end="01:11:10.720" style="s2">there without lot bund ins of both of</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.140" end="01:11:13.360" style="s2">those things now in the most recent see</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.720" end="01:11:15.160" style="s2">oh I didn&#39;t do 2019 but 2018 season if</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.360" end="01:11:16.780" style="s2">you were a for standard deviation hitter</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.160" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">which would be spectacular you would hit</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.780" end="01:11:20.740" style="s2">something like 385 something like that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:22.870" style="s2">right which is awesome that wins the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.740" end="01:11:25.510" style="s2">batting title hands down but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.870" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">have come near breaching the 400 level</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.510" end="01:11:29.140" style="s2">and the reason is because the standard</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:31.570" style="s2">deviation of batting average has gone</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.140" end="01:11:33.400" style="s2">down over time so the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.570" end="01:11:36.100" style="s2">the best player and the average player</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.400" end="01:11:38.860" style="s2">is is less today than it was in prior</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.100" end="01:11:40.540" style="s2">generations and you could test this in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.860" end="01:11:43.480" style="s2">bunch of other ways as well go look at</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.540" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">the gold silver bronze winners and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.480" end="01:11:47.740" style="s2">marathon or the 100-meter dash and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:50.110" style="s2">Olympics going overtime and what you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.740" end="01:11:52.600" style="s2">find is that those guys are a lot closer</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.110" end="01:11:55.660" style="s2">today than they were in prior</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.600" end="01:11:58.240" style="s2">generations so you know we see in</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.660" end="01:12:01.300" style="s2">basically parity in athletics in general</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.240" end="01:12:03.600" style="s2">if you look at sports leagues and B NB</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.300" end="01:12:06.400" style="s2">is not a good example hockey NFL</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.600" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">baseball they&#39;re all grindings or parody</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.400" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">part of is because there are things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:12.280" style="s2">salary caps and so forth but the bigger</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:14.470" style="s2">phenomenon is just we&#39;re drawing from</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.280" end="01:12:16.630" style="s2">larger populations of potential players</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.470" end="01:12:19.020" style="s2">we train them better we coach them</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.630" end="01:12:21.460" style="s2">better they eat better as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.020" end="01:12:23.170" style="s2">excellence has become more uniform which</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.460" end="01:12:25.090" style="s2">is really interesting perhaps where this</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.170" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">is the most powerful is in the world of</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.090" end="01:12:29.410" style="s2">investing and investing this area where</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:31.690" style="s2">the cumulative knowledge of everybody</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.410" end="01:12:33.750" style="s2">goes into asset prices and wondering as</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.690" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">we track as the standard deviation of</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.750" end="01:12:39.430" style="s2">excess returns and that has been</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:42.250" style="s2">marching steadily lower through for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.430" end="01:12:44.770" style="s2">last 50 years by the way there was one</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.250" end="01:12:48.240" style="s2">market departure from that trend and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.770" end="01:12:51.070" style="s2">that was around the dot-com period and</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.240" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">interestingly the dot-com period is when</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.070" end="01:12:55.170" style="s2">mom-and-pop came back into the stock</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:58.530" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.170" end="01:13:00.540" style="s2">droves and that setup and this goes back</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.530" end="01:13:02.969" style="s2">to your discussion about easy games that</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.540" end="01:13:05.310" style="s2">set up a situation where there was skill</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.969" end="01:13:07.170" style="s2">versus non skill and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.310" end="01:13:09.330" style="s2">the institution&#39;s ended up fleecing</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.170" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">mom-and-pop who then retreated after the</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.330" end="01:13:14.130" style="s2">dot-com thing busted and then the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:16.739" style="s2">standard deviation of skill went right</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.130" end="01:13:18.390" style="s2">back to trend of shrinking over time</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.739" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t that a fascinating thing so this</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.390" end="01:13:22.230" style="s2">idea the paradox of skill and and once</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">you hear about this idea and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.230" end="01:13:27.270" style="s2">internalize the basic framework and look</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:29.130" style="s2">around you see this everywhere where</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.270" end="01:13:31.410" style="s2">again absolute skill never higher</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.130" end="01:13:32.910" style="s2">relative skill shrinking and luck</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.410" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">becoming more and more important in</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.910" end="01:13:37.260" style="s2">determining outcomes that the takeaway</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:40.170" style="s2">is even more reason to look for the easy</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.260" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">game right that&#39;s really an overarching</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.170" end="01:13:44.100" style="s2">thesis and all this is that if you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:45.270" style="s2">skill or you have if you believe you</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.100" end="01:13:47.460" style="s2">have differential skill you want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.270" end="01:13:50.160" style="s2">figure out where to apply it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.460" end="01:13:52.380" style="s2">a really big deal and I think people</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.160" end="01:13:53.580" style="s2">don&#39;t think enough about that and right</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.380" end="01:13:55.469" style="s2">that was that&#39;s why I think that any</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.580" end="01:13:56.940" style="s2">Duke story stuck with me so much it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.469" end="01:13:58.800" style="s2">you know people thought she had you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.940" end="01:14:00.900" style="s2">sort of lost it that she was going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.800" end="01:14:03.270" style="s2">play in the lower stakes table but she</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.900" end="01:14:05.610" style="s2">was doing a cold heart calculation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.270" end="01:14:07.050" style="s2">profit per hour and that ended up being</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.610" end="01:14:09.090" style="s2">the best place to be so super</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.050" end="01:14:10.830" style="s2">interesting because had a couple other</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.090" end="01:14:14.310" style="s2">things here before we&#39;re out of time you</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.830" end="01:14:17.250" style="s2">had a section on that people lose skill</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.310" end="01:14:19.110" style="s2">with ages but so do organizations so</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.250" end="01:14:20.820" style="s2">what can you tell us about that hahaha</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.110" end="01:14:23.340" style="s2">so there&#39;s a little bit depressing but</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.820" end="01:14:25.650" style="s2">um but it turns out that what I try to</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.340" end="01:14:27.150" style="s2">do in two chapters one on luck and one</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.650" end="01:14:28.680" style="s2">on skill is to sort of characterize what</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.150" end="01:14:30.810" style="s2">they look like and you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.680" end="01:14:32.100" style="s2">characterizing skill is actually not</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.810" end="01:14:33.989" style="s2">that difficult to do and we can even do</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.100" end="01:14:35.880" style="s2">it by talking which is skill tends to</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.989" end="01:14:37.770" style="s2">follow an arc and then athletics is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.880" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2">good way to illustrate this but we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.770" end="01:14:41.790" style="s2">talk about lots of other stuff as well</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:43.140" style="s2">so let&#39;s say you&#39;re an athlete when</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.790" end="01:14:45.080" style="s2">you&#39;re young you&#39;re obviously not very</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.140" end="01:14:47.310" style="s2">skilled you&#39;re not very strong and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.080" end="01:14:49.199" style="s2">improve improve improve through practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.310" end="01:14:50.640" style="s2">and strengthening and maturation so</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.199" end="01:14:52.290" style="s2">forth and then you peak at some level</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.640" end="01:14:54.540" style="s2">and then you come down the other side so</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.290" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2">and by the way different pro sports the</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.540" end="01:14:57.690" style="s2">peak age of performance varies a little</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.400" end="01:15:00.570" style="s2">bit but it&#39;s usually somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.690" end="01:15:02.280" style="s2">mid 20s to 230 something like that so</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.570" end="01:15:03.810" style="s2">that&#39;s usually the age of peak athletic</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.280" end="01:15:05.480" style="s2">performance and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.810" end="01:15:07.010" style="s2">degradation so</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.480" end="01:15:08.690" style="s2">older athletes tend not to perform as</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.010" end="01:15:10.370" style="s2">well and by the way that you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.690" end="01:15:12.500" style="s2">of it is just basic plumbing that as you</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.370" end="01:15:14.930" style="s2">get older you just your reaction times</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.500" end="01:15:16.370" style="s2">just slow just a tiny bit and of course</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.930" end="01:15:17.989" style="s2">when you&#39;re a professional athlete for</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.370" end="01:15:19.160" style="s2">instance those those things actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.989" end="01:15:22.100" style="s2">make a huge difference in how you</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.160" end="01:15:24.440" style="s2">perform by the way the same is true in</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.100" end="01:15:25.850" style="s2">cognitive performance you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.440" end="01:15:26.870" style="s2">the theories on this is your general</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.850" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">intelligence function of your</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.870" end="01:15:30.380" style="s2">crystallized and fluid intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:31.250" style="s2">crystallized intelligence exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.380" end="01:15:33.020" style="s2">it sounds like it&#39;s your understanding</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.250" end="01:15:34.820" style="s2">facts and knowledge and so forth that</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.020" end="01:15:36.800" style="s2">tends to grow through life and absent</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.820" end="01:15:38.690" style="s2">you know sort of any kind of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.800" end="01:15:40.820" style="s2">impairment that tends to grow until</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.690" end="01:15:42.260" style="s2">you&#39;re you know well into your 70s but</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.820" end="01:15:44.120" style="s2">fluid intelligence which is your ability</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.260" end="01:15:45.860" style="s2">to deal with novelty tends to peak when</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.120" end="01:15:48.560" style="s2">you&#39;re young actually in your early 20s</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.860" end="01:15:50.720" style="s2">and declines over time so you have these</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.560" end="01:15:53.030" style="s2">countervailing forces of crystallize</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.720" end="01:15:54.890" style="s2">going up in fluid going down and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.030" end="01:15:57.140" style="s2">also creates an arc which is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.890" end="01:15:58.670" style="s2">and then you mention organizations and</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.140" end="01:16:00.710" style="s2">we see the same type of thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.670" end="01:16:03.380" style="s2">organization performance tends to also</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.710" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">follow an arc that&#39;s harder to quantify</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.380" end="01:16:07.160" style="s2">but as you know when you&#39;re you&#39;re young</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.360" end="01:16:09.170" style="s2">and you tend to be filled with sense of</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.160" end="01:16:11.540" style="s2">purpose you tend to be more nimble and</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.170" end="01:16:14.420" style="s2">then as you get larger you just become</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.540" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">more more bureaucratic part of us out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.420" end="01:16:19.070" style="s2">necessity and so one of the ways we can</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:21.470" style="s2">track that things like return on capital</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.070" end="01:16:24.200" style="s2">patterns and organizations and companies</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.470" end="01:16:25.820" style="s2">so return on capital tends to start low</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.200" end="01:16:28.100" style="s2">as you&#39;re getting going and you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.820" end="01:16:31.910" style="s2">sort of an investment phase then tends</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.100" end="01:16:33.620" style="s2">to grow and then you get to a peak and</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.910" end="01:16:35.450" style="s2">then you come down reflecting both</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.620" end="01:16:37.460" style="s2">maturation typically of the markets in</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.450" end="01:16:39.650" style="s2">which you&#39;re participating and also sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.460" end="01:16:41.060" style="s2">of the bureaucracy that tends to almost</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.650" end="01:16:43.430" style="s2">inevitably grow within your own</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.060" end="01:16:44.780" style="s2">organization yeah so that tends to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.430" end="01:16:46.820" style="s2">the pattern so that&#39;s always thing to</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.780" end="01:16:49.580" style="s2">think about is where is a company where</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.820" end="01:16:51.980" style="s2">as an individual on that pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.580" end="01:16:53.600" style="s2">skill on day on the ascend are they on</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.980" end="01:16:56.600" style="s2">the descent and what does that mean for</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.600" end="01:16:58.489" style="s2">for the future that might be a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.600" end="01:17:00.620" style="s2">little tool for doing and best min</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.489" end="01:17:02.720" style="s2">analysis right say all right here are</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.620" end="01:17:06.050" style="s2">the tells that let me know this company</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.720" end="01:17:07.430" style="s2">is past its prime yeah we actually Jim</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.050" end="01:17:10.700" style="s2">we actually do some work on that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.430" end="01:17:12.290" style="s2">what we typically do is look at is</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.700" end="01:17:14.090" style="s2">basically the degradation you call it</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.290" end="01:17:16.370" style="s2">the fate of return on capital over time</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.090" end="01:17:17.540" style="s2">and so if you have you have a high</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.370" end="01:17:19.190" style="s2">return on capital business how</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.540" end="01:17:21.590" style="s2">quickly will that regress back towards</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.190" end="01:17:22.850" style="s2">some sort of opportunity cost and one</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.590" end="01:17:24.440" style="s2">things that the empirical work will tell</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.850" end="01:17:26.440" style="s2">you which which is it&#39;s going to be very</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.440" end="01:17:30.320" style="s2">intuitive when I say this which is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.440" end="01:17:31.940" style="s2">differs by industry and sector right to</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.320" end="01:17:34.940" style="s2">state the obvious and so things like</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.940" end="01:17:37.280" style="s2">energy and parts of financial services</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.940" end="01:17:39.650" style="s2">tend to have very rapid regression right</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.280" end="01:17:41.330" style="s2">because it&#39;s easy for people to mimic</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.650" end="01:17:43.340" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and it&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.330" end="01:17:45.890" style="s2">commodity type of business and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.340" end="01:17:47.990" style="s2">replication is easy and so those returns</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.890" end="01:17:50.060" style="s2">get competed away quite quickly by</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.990" end="01:17:52.160" style="s2">contrast other businesses you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.060" end="01:17:54.500" style="s2">sort of classic examples consumer</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.160" end="01:17:56.420" style="s2">staples is that you know you probably</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.500" end="01:17:57.860" style="s2">use Proctor and Gamble products 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.420" end="01:17:59.360" style="s2">ago and you&#39;ll probably use them 30</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.860" end="01:18:01.880" style="s2">years from now those things tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.360" end="01:18:03.830" style="s2">much more stable as a consequence the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.880" end="01:18:05.090" style="s2">fades tend to be a little bit slower so</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.830" end="01:18:06.500" style="s2">you&#39;re right so a part of it is just</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.090" end="01:18:09.020" style="s2">understanding what those curves look</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.500" end="01:18:11.120" style="s2">like and also recognizing that those</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.020" end="01:18:13.580" style="s2">will vary by industry you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.120" end="01:18:14.990" style="s2">justifiably so yeah you like you wrote</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.580" end="01:18:17.030" style="s2">about that and I fact I even wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.990" end="01:18:19.790" style="s2">it the only thing I ever wrote under SF</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.030" end="01:18:22.240" style="s2">i&#39;s name was talking about where to</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.790" end="01:18:24.980" style="s2">think about exploration and exploitation</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.240" end="01:18:27.230" style="s2">right some people you know say oh there</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.980" end="01:18:28.760" style="s2">should be some you know set mix wrong it</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.230" end="01:18:31.190" style="s2">very much depends on the environment</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.760" end="01:18:32.660" style="s2">you&#39;re in if you&#39;re operating a pittin</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.190" end="01:18:35.810" style="s2">factory you&#39;re probably all about</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.660" end="01:18:37.940" style="s2">exploitation if you&#39;re working on in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.810" end="01:18:40.340" style="s2">Internet industry in 1998 you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.940" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">probably all about exploration it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.340" end="01:18:43.880" style="s2">important to get those things straight I</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.560" end="01:18:45.290" style="s2">don&#39;t want to reread your paper Jim</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.880" end="01:18:46.820" style="s2">because I want to I also want to come</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.290" end="01:18:48.500" style="s2">back to that topic I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.820" end="01:18:50.140" style="s2">first of all what you said it&#39;s spot-on</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.500" end="01:18:52.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s an absolutely fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.140" end="01:18:54.380" style="s2">concept and then the question is you</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.910" end="01:18:56.690" style="s2">know can you sit in at a board meeting</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.380" end="01:18:58.520" style="s2">or talk to a CEO and actually articulate</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.690" end="01:19:00.650" style="s2">this in a way that&#39;s that they can</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.520" end="01:19:01.580" style="s2">really get them thinking about it and it</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.650" end="01:19:03.980" style="s2">goes back to what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.580" end="01:19:05.330" style="s2">institutional bias and inertia and all</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.980" end="01:19:07.040" style="s2">these kinds of things it becomes really</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.330" end="01:19:09.020" style="s2">difficult and at least perceived</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.040" end="01:19:10.640" style="s2">expectations of the financial community</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.020" end="01:19:11.870" style="s2">it becomes very difficult for these guys</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.640" end="01:19:14.510" style="s2">they sort of paint themselves in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.870" end="01:19:17.390" style="s2">corner and overdo it on one side or the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.510" end="01:19:19.010" style="s2">other well we got time for one last item</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.390" end="01:19:21.410" style="s2">before we have to run out and I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.010" end="01:19:23.180" style="s2">you your choice I&#39;ve got lots of topics</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.410" end="01:19:25.340" style="s2">which we did not get to that your book</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.180" end="01:19:27.440" style="s2">was just such a mine of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.340" end="01:19:29.030" style="s2">things but give you a choice of which of</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.440" end="01:19:31.010" style="s2">the leads you want to exit on one</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.030" end="01:19:33.770" style="s2">earnings per share why is it</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.010" end="01:19:36.320" style="s2">shitty measure or second this would</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.770" end="01:19:38.270" style="s2">probably be my preference term I did not</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.320" end="01:19:40.730" style="s2">know so I read your book was it was</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.270" end="01:19:43.010" style="s2">deliberative practice you mentioned it</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.730" end="01:19:44.210" style="s2">many times throughout the book and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.010" end="01:19:46.100" style="s2">actually spent a fair amount of time</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.210" end="01:19:47.960" style="s2">late in the book describing it in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.100" end="01:19:49.700" style="s2">detail let&#39;s start with the latter in</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.960" end="01:19:51.530" style="s2">you know that on deliberate practice and</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.700" end="01:19:54.290" style="s2">I think this is um this goes back to a</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.530" end="01:19:55.880" style="s2">skill in skill acquisition and even</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.290" end="01:19:59.660" style="s2">spills into this whole discussion about</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.880" end="01:20:01.280" style="s2">10,000 hours so by the way it SFI we</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.660" end="01:20:03.350" style="s2">have a really fascinating program on</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.280" end="01:20:05.210" style="s2">limits you know this well so limits to</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.350" end="01:20:06.680" style="s2">all sorts of limits to knowledge limits</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.210" end="01:20:09.020" style="s2">to performance and so forth and we did a</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.680" end="01:20:10.760" style="s2">conference a couple years ago on limits</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.020" end="01:20:13.010" style="s2">of human performance and you know we had</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.760" end="01:20:14.480" style="s2">everywhere from you know talking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.010" end="01:20:17.540" style="s2">athletic performance we had special</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.480" end="01:20:19.340" style="s2">forces folks we had neuroscientist and</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.540" end="01:20:20.750" style="s2">so forth but one of the guys that sort</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.340" end="01:20:22.880" style="s2">of kicked off our discussion with ended</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.750" end="01:20:25.310" style="s2">was Anders Ericsson who was the guy</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:27.500" style="s2">whose most famous for the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.310" end="01:20:29.810" style="s2">about 10,000 hours and what Erickson</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.500" end="01:20:31.400" style="s2">argues I&#39;m gonna make this a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.810" end="01:20:33.080" style="s2">of a cartoon version of it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.400" end="01:20:35.240" style="s2">think it&#39;s that far off what Erickson</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.080" end="01:20:37.790" style="s2">argues is this idea of talent or skill</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.240" end="01:20:40.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter what matters is</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.790" end="01:20:43.160" style="s2">you apply yourself for 10,000 hours of</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.010" end="01:20:45.470" style="s2">practice and you will become elite in</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.160" end="01:20:47.420" style="s2">that particular activity so if you Jim</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.470" end="01:20:50.030" style="s2">rut want to get to Carnegie Hall playing</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.420" end="01:20:51.380" style="s2">the violin it&#39;s just 10,000 hours of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.030" end="01:20:53.810" style="s2">deliberate practice and we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.380" end="01:20:56.690" style="s2">you there right now I think anybody in</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.810" end="01:20:58.490" style="s2">the real world recognizes that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.690" end="01:21:00.380" style="s2">notion that there&#39;s no talent or skill</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.490" end="01:21:02.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense right so we all</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.380" end="01:21:04.040" style="s2">know people have musical abilities or</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.240" end="01:21:06.050" style="s2">mathematical abilities or language</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.040" end="01:21:08.840" style="s2">abilities and so forth we&#39;re athletic</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.050" end="01:21:10.310" style="s2">abilities so I just think that the point</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.840" end="01:21:12.080" style="s2">is a bit of a non-starter but this idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.310" end="01:21:13.730" style="s2">of a deliberate practice I think is</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:14.540" style="s2">really important and by the way the</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.730" end="01:21:17.090" style="s2">other thing I&#39;ll just say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.540" end="01:21:18.950" style="s2">great book called a sports gene by David</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.090" end="01:21:21.050" style="s2">Epstein David&#39;s a great guy his new book</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.950" end="01:21:23.120" style="s2">by the way also I love called range I</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.050" end="01:21:25.820" style="s2">would highly recommend that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.120" end="01:21:27.350" style="s2">also very SFI type of thing where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.820" end="01:21:29.000" style="s2">an argument about specialist versus</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.350" end="01:21:31.670" style="s2">generalist the argues very I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.000" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">persuasively in favor of generalists but</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.670" end="01:21:35.630" style="s2">in the sports gene David dismisses this</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:37.880" style="s2">idea and shows empirically this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.630" end="01:21:39.680" style="s2">10,000 hours is not really true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.880" end="01:21:41.420" style="s2">maybe an average but this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.680" end="01:21:42.830" style="s2">deliberate practice is valid so what is</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.420" end="01:21:44.309" style="s2">deliberate practice it just says if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.830" end="01:21:46.530" style="s2">want to get better at something</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.309" end="01:21:47.909" style="s2">and this is this comes from Anders</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.530" end="01:21:49.829" style="s2">Ericsson you want to do what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.909" end="01:21:52.530" style="s2">deliberate practice which is operating</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.829" end="01:21:54.959" style="s2">at the edge of your capabilities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.530" end="01:21:58.829" style="s2">getting very accurate and timely</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.959" end="01:22:01.649" style="s2">feedback typically from a coach and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.829" end="01:22:03.089" style="s2">actually not fun so it&#39;s easy to apply</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.649" end="01:22:05.789" style="s2">to some things like sports right your</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.089" end="01:22:07.559" style="s2">your tennis player and you and and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.789" end="01:22:08.999" style="s2">you practice every day at the edge of</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.559" end="01:22:11.219" style="s2">your performance you have a coach giving</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.999" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">you timely and accurate feedback and</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.219" end="01:22:16.409" style="s2">it&#39;s hard work right and and also there</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:17.909" style="s2">are components that you need rest and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.409" end="01:22:20.189" style="s2">forth and how those things fit into that</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.909" end="01:22:21.629" style="s2">and so the idea is that most of us don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.189" end="01:22:23.369" style="s2">actually ever get to the point of</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.629" end="01:22:24.659" style="s2">deliberate practice on most things right</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.369" end="01:22:26.609" style="s2">so if you want to learn to drive your</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.659" end="01:22:29.189" style="s2">car you know you get to you get to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.609" end="01:22:31.319" style="s2">competent at it and you&#39;ll leave it</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.189" end="01:22:33.229" style="s2">there so good enough for most things is</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.319" end="01:22:35.939" style="s2">good enough but to truly become</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.229" end="01:22:37.919" style="s2">outstanding at something especially in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.939" end="01:22:39.959" style="s2">fairly defined domain you need this idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.919" end="01:22:41.129" style="s2">of deliberate practice so one things I</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.959" end="01:22:42.809" style="s2">and we could even muse about this</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.129" end="01:22:45.479" style="s2">together gym right now which is this</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.809" end="01:22:47.699" style="s2">idea of if that&#39;s a valid construct for</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.479" end="01:22:49.229" style="s2">how to get really good at something what</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.699" end="01:22:51.749" style="s2">is the equivalent of deliberate practice</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.229" end="01:22:53.729" style="s2">in business so you&#39;re gonna coach an</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.749" end="01:22:56.129" style="s2">executive like how do you coach that</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.729" end="01:22:58.349" style="s2">that individual so that he or she can</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.129" end="01:23:00.149" style="s2">actually become more skillful in</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.349" end="01:23:02.189" style="s2">investing what is deliberate practice</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.149" end="01:23:04.619" style="s2">mean and investing right investing is an</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.189" end="01:23:06.629" style="s2">inherently noisy exercise as a</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.619" end="01:23:09.749" style="s2">consequence it&#39;s very difficult to give</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.629" end="01:23:12.030" style="s2">people clean feedback your business is</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.749" end="01:23:14.039" style="s2">very noisy hard to get people clean</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.030" end="01:23:15.809" style="s2">feedback right so that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.039" end="01:23:17.699" style="s2">interesting open question which is are</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.809" end="01:23:20.479" style="s2">there methods or techniques that we</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.699" end="01:23:22.679" style="s2">could use to get more effective at</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.479" end="01:23:24.599" style="s2">prescribing deliberate practice and</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.679" end="01:23:27.179" style="s2">domains that are not again very tidy</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.599" end="01:23:28.530" style="s2">where the feedback is clear and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.179" end="01:23:31.169" style="s2">so I think is I think it&#39;s an incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.530" end="01:23:32.879" style="s2">interesting topic and it gets into</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.169" end="01:23:35.339" style="s2">things like how do we train how do we</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.879" end="01:23:37.559" style="s2">you know NSF I we did a little fun</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.339" end="01:23:39.419" style="s2">session on agent based models and part</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.559" end="01:23:41.909" style="s2">of the the power of agent based models</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.419" end="01:23:44.579" style="s2">is it allows you to expand your mind and</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.909" end="01:23:46.679" style="s2">understand how certain causes and</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.579" end="01:23:48.839" style="s2">effects come out of these simple little</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.679" end="01:23:50.579" style="s2">models it just changes the way you think</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.839" end="01:23:52.109" style="s2">about things and I think that whole idea</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.579" end="01:23:53.659" style="s2">of deliberate practice is another really</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.109" end="01:23:56.150" style="s2">cool area that we could</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.659" end="01:23:57.679" style="s2">explore do your question about you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.150" end="01:24:01.429" style="s2">in business as you know I do a little</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.679" end="01:24:04.400" style="s2">CEO coaching from time to time and what</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.429" end="01:24:06.439" style="s2">I have decided for my CEO coaching which</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.400" end="01:24:07.849" style="s2">is the closest thing to this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.439" end="01:24:09.820" style="s2">deliberative practice that I can think</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.849" end="01:24:13.789" style="s2">of in my own experience is I focus</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.820" end="01:24:16.099" style="s2">relentlessly on time management right</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.789" end="01:24:17.780" style="s2">and Ty instantly is a client management</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.099" end="01:24:19.909" style="s2">that sounds boring as but in</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.780" end="01:24:21.079" style="s2">reality I&#39;ve concluded the time</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.909" end="01:24:24.019" style="s2">management is really how we</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.079" end="01:24:26.809" style="s2">operationalize our priorities and our</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.019" end="01:24:28.849" style="s2">priorities are critical but writing your</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.809" end="01:24:31.639" style="s2">priorities on the whiteboard is one</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.849" end="01:24:33.679" style="s2">thing actually living them is another so</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.639" end="01:24:36.289" style="s2">whenever I&#39;m doing a CEO coach and thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.679" end="01:24:38.539" style="s2">I start off with a priorities exercise</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.289" end="01:24:40.999" style="s2">and then I do a time management exercise</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.539" end="01:24:42.949" style="s2">seemingly separate and then I point out</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.999" end="01:24:44.860" style="s2">the contradictions to the person I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.949" end="01:24:47.689" style="s2">coaching and then I provide a</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.860" end="01:24:49.400" style="s2">prescription on how they should approach</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.689" end="01:24:51.079" style="s2">their time management and I give them</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.400" end="01:24:53.419" style="s2">things like take this piece of paper</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.079" end="01:24:55.219" style="s2">that you just created and tape it to</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.419" end="01:24:57.650" style="s2">your computer so you see it several</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.219" end="01:25:00.709" style="s2">times a day and think of time management</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.650" end="01:25:02.630" style="s2">as the deliberative practice you have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.709" end="01:25:05.090" style="s2">force yourself to do against your own</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.630" end="01:25:06.739" style="s2">inclinations and likes and dislikes if</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.090" end="01:25:08.329" style="s2">you&#39;re going to actually achieve the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.739" end="01:25:10.309" style="s2">priorities that you really care about</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.329" end="01:25:12.169" style="s2">see I love that and I&#39;ll just mention</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.309" end="01:25:13.939" style="s2">you know this is completely related</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.169" end="01:25:15.650" style="s2">which is there was a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.939" end="01:25:17.119" style="s2">survey of investment committees these</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.650" end="01:25:18.530" style="s2">are you know down nents and pension</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.119" end="01:25:20.809" style="s2">funds and so forth making investment</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.530" end="01:25:22.489" style="s2">decisions and they asked the each member</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.809" end="01:25:24.650" style="s2">of the investment committee what should</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.489" end="01:25:26.510" style="s2">we be doing and rank these things in</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.650" end="01:25:28.429" style="s2">order right and then they actually kept</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.510" end="01:25:31.159" style="s2">track of what they actually did and they</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.429" end="01:25:32.809" style="s2">were almost flipped to lists right and</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.159" end="01:25:34.639" style="s2">so it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s like time</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.809" end="01:25:36.499" style="s2">management like why are we spending on</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.639" end="01:25:37.880" style="s2">time on things we shouldn&#39;t be spending</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.499" end="01:25:39.349" style="s2">time on and why are we not spending time</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.880" end="01:25:41.389" style="s2">on the things we should be spending time</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.349" end="01:25:42.800" style="s2">on but it goes back to a little bit you</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.389" end="01:25:44.360" style="s2">know part of the challenge I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.800" end="01:25:45.650" style="s2">see this even in your CEO coaching which</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.360" end="01:25:47.179" style="s2">is some of the challenges sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.650" end="01:25:49.099" style="s2">make the right decision now you get your</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.179" end="01:25:50.479" style="s2">time priorities correct right sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.099" end="01:25:52.010" style="s2">you make a decision which is the right</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.479" end="01:25:52.969" style="s2">decision that doesn&#39;t work out and</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.010" end="01:25:56.150" style="s2">that&#39;s where you have to say to people</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.969" end="01:25:58.400" style="s2">you did the right thing dust yourself</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.150" end="01:26:00.019" style="s2">off and go do it again tomorrow right</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.400" end="01:26:02.209" style="s2">and sometimes you make a dumb decision</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.019" end="01:26:03.860" style="s2">it works out and you go wait a second</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.209" end="01:26:05.160" style="s2">like recognize that you were just got</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.860" end="01:26:07.260" style="s2">you&#39;re just completely</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.160" end="01:26:09.090" style="s2">on this next time think about it more</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.260" end="01:26:11.760" style="s2">effectively right so that&#39;s that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.090" end="01:26:14.250" style="s2">this idea of giving people you know sort</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.760" end="01:26:15.660" style="s2">of see through the outcomes and saying</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.250" end="01:26:17.550" style="s2">like let&#39;s make sure you&#39;re focused on</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.660" end="01:26:18.690" style="s2">the proper process and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.550" end="01:26:21.090" style="s2">another area that could really be</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.690" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">helpful to get people to continue to</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.090" end="01:26:25.680" style="s2">focus on process as it means to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.520" end="01:26:27.210" style="s2">long-term outcomes successful long term</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.680" end="01:26:28.860" style="s2">outcomes in fact I do exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.210" end="01:26:30.630" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the advantages I have</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.860" end="01:26:32.280" style="s2">having had a zillion years of business</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.630" end="01:26:35.190" style="s2">experience with a large number of</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.280" end="01:26:37.530" style="s2">businesses as I have I&#39;ve said both of</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.190" end="01:26:39.270" style="s2">those things definitely which is okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.530" end="01:26:41.520" style="s2">you failed but you failed honorably and</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.270" end="01:26:43.530" style="s2">intentionally and next time that comes</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.520" end="01:26:45.270" style="s2">up do the same thing ie view the same</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.530" end="01:26:46.770" style="s2">process and over time you will be a</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.270" end="01:26:49.340" style="s2">winner and on the other hand I</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.770" end="01:26:53.100" style="s2">definitely have told people Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.340" end="01:26:54.930" style="s2">did you luck out right won&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.100" end="01:26:58.200" style="s2">again because probably next time you&#39;re</p>
