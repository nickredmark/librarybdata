<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">I&#39;m impressed by what what you do and I</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">on this journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t know I think I I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">Brazil and and I think from early on I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve always had a sense of the world you</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">know like sometimes you grow you grow up</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:42.630" style="s2">in a place or you have a kind of a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">place-based life I think I also enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.630" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">the world and I loved science and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">loved like I was very curious um and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">think I had a few early influences</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">mainly for my own family my sister my</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">older sister about ecology and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">environment and I got interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">topic but I I grew up I he thinks just</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">because when I&#39;m trying to piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">together my influences I think actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">one of the core influences was like okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">growing up with someone that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">studying in college in biology that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">my sister</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">also I grew up listening to punk and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:22.830" style="s2">hardcore aimed at some follow you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:25.740" style="s2">punk hardcore scene which really shaped</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.830" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">my political views and really created</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.740" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">that thing of like do-it-yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:32.550" style="s2">honor keys erm and and and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">I&#39;m very grateful for that influence</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.550" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">because I think I think it just made me</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">feel powerful like he made me feel that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:43.260" style="s2">I have agency and power to change the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:47.610" style="s2">system to fight the system to you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.260" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">fight injustice uh and then when my</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:52.710" style="s2">interests for the environment and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">planet and also spirituality came it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.710" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">kind of came on top of that frame so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">always joke that I&#39;m too Punk to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:02.460" style="s2">proper hippie and I&#39;m too hippie to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:05.460" style="s2">proper phone so I you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.460" end="00:03:07.290" style="s2">charity an activity like together just</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.460" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">briefly because I resonate strongly with</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.290" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">that because I also always felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">balancing between the the punk and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:19.380" style="s2">hippie but have you and I know from from</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">the rules has recently written is um I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.380" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually a book and but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:28.730" style="s2">only just saw the article that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:31.560" style="s2">was it mystical anarchism and in it he</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.730" end="00:03:33.780" style="s2">redefined anarchism for me because in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.560" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">since my Punk days I kind of got to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.780" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">point while we need some form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">structure and it made the same mistake</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.500" end="00:03:44.100" style="s2">of defining anarchism as if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">rule at all and no order at all but he</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.100" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">defines it much more in the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:49.739" style="s2">subsidiarity based system where people</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.930" style="s2">in place make the decision that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.739" end="00:03:54.810" style="s2">matter to them which is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.930" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">reader regionalization localization and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.810" end="00:04:04.020" style="s2">regeneration agenda you know I always</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">and then I mean we&#39;re gonna jump forth</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.020" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">and back anyway I don&#39;t think they I</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">think it isn&#39;t gonna be a very lucky</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.010" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">because I think for me as well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.510" end="00:04:17.790" style="s2">when that&#39;s why I went into sociology</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">and understanding governance because for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.790" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">me that&#39;s making sense of anarchism is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">like we actually need the tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">processes to be able to self-govern</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:29.610" style="s2">and and I feel a little bit sad that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">like a small state has become so</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.610" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">attached to the right-wing or liberal</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:40.319" style="s2">economics that a made the left want a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.050" end="00:04:42.360" style="s2">strong state instead of the left also</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.319" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">saying actually no we need we need power</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.360" end="00:04:46.349" style="s2">devolved to the people and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">Brazil had some really great experiments</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.349" end="00:04:50.910" style="s2">about this when I was growing up so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:53.669" style="s2">think that that was also an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.910" end="00:04:55.949" style="s2">political influence but I I feel I feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.669" end="00:04:59.940" style="s2">sad when I see the left so you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.949" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">wanting a big a big welfare state and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.940" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">the people that are actually asking for</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:08.970" style="s2">or a small state are all the the free</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">market capitalist and neoliberal so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.970" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">I think we need to like reframe how can</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">we how can we also aim for no states but</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:18.840" style="s2">in a way that actually looks after</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.909" style="s2">people better that&#39;s people are looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.840" end="00:05:25.370" style="s2">after themselves I&#39;m increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.909" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">getting to understand how central the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.370" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">reorganization along the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.870" end="00:05:32.550" style="s2">subsidiarity actually is to the redesign</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:37.139" style="s2">of the human impact on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.550" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">because that&#39;s how life feels exactly we</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.139" end="00:05:41.849" style="s2">will never be able to adjourn our</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:44.570" style="s2">presence with the presence like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.849" end="00:05:46.860" style="s2">dynamics of ecosystems and this nested</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.570" end="00:05:49.229" style="s2">wholeness that isn&#39;t separate we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.860" end="00:05:51.030" style="s2">local regional and global like yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.229" end="00:05:54.169" style="s2">another boundary in our mind that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.030" end="00:05:56.759" style="s2">created and but but it to enable</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.169" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">appropriate participation in this nested</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.759" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">complexity you have to give the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:04.710" style="s2">in the place to that this right to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.710" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">the decisions and to meet their needs</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.710" end="00:06:09.810" style="s2">but of course in a saver type attitude</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">of being in service to life creating</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.810" end="00:06:14.159" style="s2">conditions conducive to life and if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:17.580" style="s2">all agree to that and we build a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.159" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">political system that enables it then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.580" end="00:06:22.020" style="s2">enable diversity which is how life</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.599" style="s2">thrives and is creative and continues to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.020" end="00:06:29.639" style="s2">and if anything else just won&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.599" end="00:06:32.610" style="s2">yeah I think that it is central there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.639" end="00:06:36.110" style="s2">this restructuring of the political</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.610" end="00:06:38.629" style="s2">process to and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.110" end="00:06:41.930" style="s2">to keep that like for me book ching is</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.629" end="00:06:44.090" style="s2">like my you know my gaiden and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.930" end="00:06:46.819" style="s2">of social ecology and while he says that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.090" end="00:06:50.060" style="s2">i really love it&#39;s like you have what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.819" end="00:06:51.949" style="s2">what he calls first nature which is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:54.500" style="s2">wild you know life creates conditions</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.949" end="00:06:56.659" style="s2">conducive to life it&#39;s how healthy</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.500" end="00:06:58.580" style="s2">ecosystems work is how our body works is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.659" end="00:07:01.340" style="s2">like the patterning of living systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.580" end="00:07:03.650" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve created a second nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.340" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">which is the human nature we created our</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.650" end="00:07:09.650" style="s2">institutions our economy our educational</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.940" style="s2">our health systems that don&#39;t follow</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.650" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">with the don&#39;t follow the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.940" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">principles so how can we integrate you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:18.860" style="s2">know first and second nature to create</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">your belief system is like you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:20.810" style="s2">that&#39;s so central that if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.199" end="00:08:25.250" style="s2">continue and this is what what&#39;s paining</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.810" end="00:08:29.719" style="s2">me so much in being in touch like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.250" end="00:08:34.039" style="s2">are as well with a wide spectrum of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.039" end="00:08:40.039" style="s2">world just give it some kind of framing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.329" end="00:08:41.959" style="s2">because there are people in industry</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.039" end="00:08:43.699" style="s2">they&#39;re people working in the UN that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.959" end="00:08:45.500" style="s2">really are passionate they get up every</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.699" end="00:08:47.390" style="s2">morning with passion and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.500" end="00:08:50.600" style="s2">their life trying to do a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.390" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">at the same time in all the the activist</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.600" end="00:08:54.290" style="s2">movements and the people were saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:57.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong kind of green we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.290" end="00:09:00.430" style="s2">need these these kind of corporate green</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.800" end="00:09:03.110" style="s2">deals that ultimately won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.430" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">they are also passionate good people but</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.110" end="00:09:10.070" style="s2">what I find frustrating is that we keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:11.570" style="s2">em standing still telling each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.070" end="00:09:12.589" style="s2">where we&#39;re just a little bit wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.570" end="00:09:16.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite got it yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.589" end="00:09:18.250" style="s2">um or our strategy is mistaken or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.279" end="00:09:21.529" style="s2">still believing in that how can you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.250" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">instead of understanding that the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.529" end="00:09:27.560" style="s2">intention to be in service to life to to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:29.630" style="s2">do things differently in a sane away is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.560" end="00:09:31.820" style="s2">something that we all share and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.630" end="00:09:33.230" style="s2">that if we and that&#39;s why I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.820" end="00:09:34.760" style="s2">obsessed with this starting with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.230" end="00:09:36.829" style="s2">questions rather than answers and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.760" end="00:09:39.019" style="s2">solutions because the minute you hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.829" end="00:09:40.730" style="s2">answers and solutions really lightly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.019" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">understand they&#39;re never final and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.730" end="00:09:45.800" style="s2">they&#39;re never fully correct and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:48.589" style="s2">never perfect you can allow everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.800" end="00:09:50.690" style="s2">opinion and you can still move forward</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2">together because as we walk</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.690" end="00:09:54.649" style="s2">shoulder-to-shoulder into the future we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">can have the conversation about where we</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.649" end="00:10:00.260" style="s2">might be mistaken we can improve our</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:05.000" style="s2">questions but if we just argue with each</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.260" end="00:10:06.860" style="s2">other we don&#39;t get ya I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.000" end="00:10:11.269" style="s2">a lot about this as well so for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.860" end="00:10:13.610" style="s2">like the first I think because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.269" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">a moment that is really existential and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.610" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">wet and you know it&#39;s really about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:24.680" style="s2">existence of humanity on the planet like</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.370" end="00:10:27.620" style="s2">I go as into a like the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.680" end="00:10:29.959" style="s2">really wha what&#39;s on the table here in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.620" end="00:10:33.140" style="s2">terms of like global problems and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.959" end="00:10:35.540" style="s2">the the and the issue is existential so</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.140" end="00:10:39.170" style="s2">I think we need to approach it with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:39.890" style="s2">kind of intention that this is I I keep</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.170" end="00:10:42.709" style="s2">saying that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.890" end="00:10:44.540" style="s2">because it&#39;s so existential this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.709" end="00:10:46.670" style="s2">about humanity</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.540" end="00:10:50.660" style="s2">owning our role on the planet this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.670" end="00:10:53.420" style="s2">about you know this the awakening for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.660" end="00:10:56.149" style="s2">is the awakening of us owning really</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.420" end="00:10:58.699" style="s2">what it is to be a human and an active</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.149" end="00:10:59.970" style="s2">participate er in this community of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.699" end="00:11:03.239" style="s2">on the planet right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.970" end="00:11:05.399" style="s2">but how we get there I keep saying that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.239" end="00:11:07.799" style="s2">you know we have the Revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.399" end="00:11:09.059" style="s2">approaches and the revolutionaries which</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.799" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2">is let&#39;s create a new financial system</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.059" end="00:11:13.649" style="s2">let&#39;s create a new money system a new</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.339" end="00:11:15.539" style="s2">educational system and we have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.649" end="00:11:18.029" style="s2">reformist approach which is oh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.539" end="00:11:20.789" style="s2">let&#39;s make an impact investment</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.029" end="00:11:23.999" style="s2">portfolio so you know even philanthropic</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.789" end="00:11:26.069" style="s2">capital is not being used in to support</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.999" end="00:11:29.819" style="s2">fossil fuel companies or porn and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.069" end="00:11:31.679" style="s2">know like it is now um or you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.819" end="00:11:33.899" style="s2">change education a little bit like I</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.679" end="00:11:36.929" style="s2">think we need both at the moment as long</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.899" end="00:11:39.629" style="s2">as we have the revolutionaries and as</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.929" end="00:11:41.999" style="s2">long as we&#39;re resourcing them and as</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.629" end="00:11:44.549" style="s2">long as they are you know focused on</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.999" end="00:11:46.319" style="s2">that task and create space so there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.549" end="00:11:48.779" style="s2">people that are fully focused on</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.319" end="00:11:50.909" style="s2">developing the new stuff I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.779" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">of people can just reform where they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.909" end="00:11:55.409" style="s2">and and what you know Joanna Macy says</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:56.999" style="s2">as well like the the hand actions you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.409" end="00:11:59.309" style="s2">know that our buying airs a bit a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.999" end="00:12:01.829" style="s2">time because we&#39;re not gonna get the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.309" end="00:12:06.119" style="s2">revolution done in 10 years and for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.829" end="00:12:08.069" style="s2">10 years is what we have so uh yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.119" end="00:12:10.619" style="s2">feel like we need everyone and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.069" end="00:12:13.619" style="s2">just to go back to yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.619" end="00:12:17.999" style="s2">again it&#39;s this like I&#39;ve heard myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.619" end="00:12:22.259" style="s2">say right and and spread the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.999" end="00:12:23.669" style="s2">we we don&#39;t need incremental change that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.259" end="00:12:28.519" style="s2">it&#39;s just not going to do it we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.669" end="00:12:35.189" style="s2">transformative change for many years but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.519" end="00:12:39.869" style="s2">the both/and of that is to say can we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.189" end="00:12:42.149" style="s2">not see for example right now if if some</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.869" end="00:12:46.409" style="s2">european governments are committed to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.149" end="00:12:50.039" style="s2">kind of green new deal response to post</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.409" end="00:12:51.329" style="s2">pandemic reanimation of an economy that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.039" end="00:12:55.169" style="s2">we actually don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.329" end="00:12:57.119" style="s2">reanimate again but in the process it</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.169" end="00:13:00.479" style="s2">means building green infrastructure and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.119" end="00:13:03.059" style="s2">and finding ways to basically phase out</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.479" end="00:13:04.589" style="s2">entire industries because we realized</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.059" end="00:13:07.679" style="s2">that there&#39;s no point in rescuing them</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.589" end="00:13:09.779" style="s2">now because they&#39;re basically making us</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.679" end="00:13:12.350" style="s2">run against the climate wall</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.779" end="00:13:12.350" style="s2">em</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.070" end="00:13:20.900" style="s2">it might only be incremental change but</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.860" end="00:13:24.300" style="s2">who am I to know or judge how this</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.900" end="00:13:27.150" style="s2">incremental change shifts the overall</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.300" end="00:13:29.250" style="s2">enabling conditions that would then</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.150" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">finally allow the transformative change</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.250" end="00:13:35.340" style="s2">to really learn so that that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:37.740" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to do a both and like I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.340" end="00:13:39.390" style="s2">another way that I&#39;ve sort of tried to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.740" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">play with this lately because you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.390" end="00:13:45.900" style="s2">in our movement lots of people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:50.130" style="s2">saying oh it&#39;s the movement from ego to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.900" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">equal and tribe you loves very much</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.130" end="00:13:56.250" style="s2">it&#39;s these tool that the pyramid and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.200" end="00:14:01.950" style="s2">circle and and I just quickly sure if</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.250" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen this M yeah if you apply the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.950" end="00:14:09.810" style="s2">the the Triad to this and you see ego</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:11.190" style="s2">and equal as an expression of life&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.810" end="00:14:13.170" style="s2">talked about this briefly earlier and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.190" end="00:14:16.650" style="s2">before we started recording that that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.170" end="00:14:19.230" style="s2">are actually all of it that&#39;s all but</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.650" end="00:14:22.650" style="s2">we&#39;re also in our experiential space we</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.230" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">are being for our self yeah so intention</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.650" end="00:14:28.530" style="s2">of all life is between M being for</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.370" end="00:18:19.630" style="s2">interconnection at a much deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.380" end="00:18:22.360" style="s2">than just reading about biology or</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.630" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">ecology or you know I also studied</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.360" end="00:18:26.860" style="s2">physics at the time I went to university</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">to study physics cuz I was really</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.540" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">fascination you know with the universe I</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.150" end="00:18:53.830" style="s2">think just kept growing and then I came</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:55.480" style="s2">to Europe just because I wanted to live</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:23.110" style="s2">environmental activism and then this was</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.590" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">2004 and and I started working for lush</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.110" end="00:19:28.870" style="s2">in the shop as a sales assistant and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:30.100" style="s2">then you know I was a bit bothered by</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.870" end="00:19:32.710" style="s2">some of the things that I considered</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.100" end="00:19:34.270" style="s2">green washing back in 2004 which is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.710" end="00:19:35.980" style="s2">okay if you want to be an s4 business</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.270" end="00:19:37.240" style="s2">why do we have this like why are we</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.980" end="00:19:39.610" style="s2">doing this where it&#39;s like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.240" end="00:19:42.210" style="s2">lighting and like how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.610" end="00:19:44.650" style="s2">recycle the waste from the stores and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.210" end="00:19:46.120" style="s2">then like the owner of lush who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.650" end="00:19:48.460" style="s2">the big boss you know one of the owners</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.120" end="00:19:50.580" style="s2">of lush walked in and then you know I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.460" end="00:19:51.780" style="s2">think it&#39;s someone that that&#39;s used to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.580" end="00:19:55.740" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.780" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">like a lot of attention from people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.740" end="00:20:00.090" style="s2">I just grilled him and then said okay do</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:02.160" style="s2">you want to do it and I said yeah hell</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.090" end="00:20:04.220" style="s2">yeah you know I have this policy of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.160" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">saying yes to life</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.220" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s how study then I became</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:11.460" style="s2">like the Environmental Officer for lush</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:17.460" style="s2">like it was you know it&#39;s an accident</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.460" end="00:20:19.740" style="s2">right and then I think as I became as I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.460" end="00:20:23.670" style="s2">became more aware of management systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.740" end="00:20:28.140" style="s2">and teams and like also the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.670" end="00:20:29.730" style="s2">kind of dark side of power and and not</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.140" end="00:20:32.040" style="s2">even like lush is a pretty cool place to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.730" end="00:20:34.410" style="s2">work but but just already understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.040" end="00:20:38.490" style="s2">a little bit more of how can I uphold my</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.410" end="00:20:41.400" style="s2">anarchist values you know as as I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.490" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">working in a more business sector then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.400" end="00:20:45.990" style="s2">went fully to dragon dreaming so shiok</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a lot for see like and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.990" end="00:20:51.090" style="s2">this idea again how can we align I I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.770" style="s2">went into permaculture and oh because</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.090" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">for me it&#39;s the same pattern it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.770" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">living systems based approaches that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:21:00.170" style="s2">know allow us to organize the human</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:05.160" style="s2">endeavors in a way that&#39;s more aligned</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.170" end="00:21:08.040" style="s2">why did you get into the the link with</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.160" end="00:21:09.900" style="s2">permaculture after you already got the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.040" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">job with Russian so it was part of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:15.180" style="s2">job or were you already connected there</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:20.160" style="s2">and and and then brought that into lush</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.180" end="00:21:21.810" style="s2">uh I think the second I think I became I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.160" end="00:21:23.940" style="s2">think I wa I already know about</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.810" end="00:21:27.180" style="s2">permaculture and eco villages already I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.940" end="00:21:28.980" style="s2">think I think also one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.180" end="00:21:31.530" style="s2">things I wanted to do when I came to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.980" end="00:21:33.390" style="s2">Europe or to do any any D that was also</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.530" end="00:21:36.210" style="s2">one of my things I want to do any D in</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.390" end="00:21:38.790" style="s2">train horn was my Michael ended up doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.210" end="00:21:41.190" style="s2">in Samara which was a whole experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.790" end="00:21:41.820" style="s2">in itself those also really shaped Who I</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.190" end="00:21:46.350" style="s2">am too</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.820" end="00:21:47.490" style="s2">um and yeah and then I and then I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.350" end="00:21:50.250" style="s2">remember I organized the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.490" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">introduction to permaculture at lush I</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.250" end="00:21:57.720" style="s2">think it was 2009 so maybe over ten</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:22:00.540" style="s2">years ago even less um and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.720" end="00:22:02.280" style="s2">and then I think at the same time people</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.540" end="00:22:03.540" style="s2">like famine Constantine who has been</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.280" end="00:22:08.820" style="s2">super important</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.540" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">in the in the building the dream of lush</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.820" end="00:22:12.570" style="s2">to become a regenerative business I</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:14.940" style="s2">think he really fell in love with</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.570" end="00:22:19.710" style="s2">permaculture and then you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.940" end="00:22:21.690" style="s2">thing ended up developing in a more</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.710" end="00:22:23.460" style="s2">structured way like with the buying team</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.690" end="00:22:25.700" style="s2">actively seeking out permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.460" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">projects and actively funding</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.700" end="00:22:31.860" style="s2">regenerative design and agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:36.600" style="s2">permaculture and that&#39;s I think the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.860" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">first time I heard about the link</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.600" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">between lush and the eco village</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:41.670" style="s2">movement and particularly through</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:45.960" style="s2">cautions even Lyndon and Martin Stengel</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.670" end="00:22:48.210" style="s2">and the IDI there and and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.960" end="00:22:51.180" style="s2">it was through Paulo he told her or he</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.210" end="00:22:54.180" style="s2">was on one of those he isn&#39;t and then he</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.180" end="00:22:57.720" style="s2">ended up through the gen network helping</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.180" end="00:22:59.610" style="s2">to build some of these links for where</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.720" end="00:23:02.040" style="s2">small suppliers like growers would</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.610" end="00:23:11.250" style="s2">actually start growing for lush directly</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.040" end="00:23:13.080" style="s2">and that was 2009 yeah I think the so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.250" end="00:23:17.780" style="s2">met Paulo and then we ended up moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.080" end="00:23:21.150" style="s2">together so you know we became partners</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.780" end="00:23:23.400" style="s2">2009 and then I was already working for</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.150" end="00:23:26.390" style="s2">lush so you know we were trying to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.400" end="00:23:30.000" style="s2">bring more influences but I think from</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.390" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">it was actually a really beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.000" end="00:23:35.550" style="s2">that happened we took I took six months</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:37.590" style="s2">off lush and Paul and I were living</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.550" end="00:23:39.150" style="s2">Portugal in a project that he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:41.210" style="s2">helping to build this trouble building</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.150" end="00:23:43.860" style="s2">and you know like living the dream</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.210" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">living in a yurt with an outside kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:48.450" style="s2">and I would find bath and compost toilet</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">solar hot water for my culture gardens</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.450" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">all of that and then we started writing</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:55.260" style="s2">this vision for lush and it was because</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.170" style="s2">we wanted to go back to Brazil and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.260" end="00:24:00.300" style="s2">create this we had this vision that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.170" end="00:24:02.760" style="s2">could create community with what we call</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.300" end="00:24:04.560" style="s2">bio refinery so no longer a factory but</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.760" end="00:24:08.040" style="s2">just like how can we take plant matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.560" end="00:24:10.410" style="s2">in really interconnected circular design</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.040" end="00:24:12.810" style="s2">and you know produce raw materials but</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.410" end="00:24:15.150" style="s2">soap but also essential oils and use the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.810" end="00:24:18.059" style="s2">waste to grow mushrooms like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.150" end="00:24:19.740" style="s2">designed that whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.059" end="00:24:21.780" style="s2">like really connected to permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.740" end="00:24:23.429" style="s2">designs and ring of energy and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.780" end="00:24:26.460" style="s2">community and all that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.429" end="00:24:29.400" style="s2">presented that to much like they you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.460" end="00:24:31.320" style="s2">know they loved the vision so they asked</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.400" end="00:24:34.110" style="s2">they said of course this is totally your</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.320" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">topic but why don&#39;t we start and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.110" end="00:24:38.760" style="s2">they invited Paulo to join and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.299" end="00:24:41.549" style="s2">when Paulo started working Simon and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.760" end="00:24:43.799" style="s2">then using the huge network of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.549" end="00:24:45.690" style="s2">permaculture and and Jen and real global</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.799" end="00:24:47.340" style="s2">eco village network to identify key</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.690" end="00:24:49.530" style="s2">partners that had already the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.340" end="00:24:53.850" style="s2">permaculture framing and I had already</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.530" end="00:24:58.220" style="s2">the right kind of I think the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.850" end="00:25:01.530" style="s2">frame so instead of trying to develop</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.220" end="00:25:03.000" style="s2">like standard farming practices they</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.530" end="00:25:05.700" style="s2">were working with people who already</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.000" end="00:25:07.500" style="s2">understood it and and then allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.700" end="00:25:09.720" style="s2">build their businesses in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.500" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">that could fund lush and of course good</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.720" end="00:25:14.490" style="s2">friend Ansari could send raw materials</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:16.140" style="s2">to lush with lush funding them so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.490" end="00:25:19.020" style="s2">have this idea of financial succession</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.140" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">where you know lush slowly reduces</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.020" end="00:25:25.080" style="s2">investment while the local business with</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:29.280" style="s2">a network of farmers the sort of process</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.080" end="00:25:33.000" style="s2">of active incubation yeah not only</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.280" end="00:25:35.100" style="s2">builds up a responsible and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.000" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">supply line but actually also helps in</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.100" end="00:25:41.669" style="s2">the place a whole community pattern to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:43.740" style="s2">develop it&#39;s wonderful and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.669" end="00:25:45.630" style="s2">returns of development it&#39;s not easy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.740" end="00:25:47.549" style="s2">we made so many mistakes and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.630" end="00:25:50.669" style="s2">projects didn&#39;t go well and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.549" end="00:25:53.669" style="s2">there were trust issues there were</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.669" end="00:25:55.350" style="s2">issues where you know you count on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.669" end="00:25:57.720" style="s2">certain yields you know like there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.350" end="00:25:59.669" style="s2">also business pressures there where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.720" end="00:26:01.799" style="s2">make you know you build it your business</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.669" end="00:26:06.059" style="s2">case and then if the yields are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.799" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">correct because maybe the you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.059" end="00:26:11.370" style="s2">to grow things that should not be grown</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:13.320" style="s2">in that place or that you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.370" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">trying to grow things organically and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.320" end="00:26:17.580" style="s2">may take longer in order to get the use</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.070" style="s2">that you&#39;re used to by the industry</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.580" end="00:26:21.630" style="s2">that&#39;s not operating from the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.070" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">principles and so I think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.630" end="00:26:25.380" style="s2">yeah but but we had some really</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:27.960" style="s2">successful projects as well like with</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.380" end="00:26:30.419" style="s2">with JP I began a permaculture institute</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.960" end="00:26:31.410" style="s2">they&#39;ve been supplying Moringa oil to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.419" end="00:26:33.540" style="s2">lodge for ten</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.410" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">years now but it&#39;s a large network of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.540" end="00:26:37.560" style="s2">farmers that is I mean it what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:39.270" style="s2">just explaining we&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.560" end="00:26:40.590" style="s2">conversations before about the stories</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.270" end="00:26:42.600" style="s2">of where it worked and where it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.590" end="00:26:45.450" style="s2">work in and how it also sits in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.600" end="00:26:48.330" style="s2">larger like as a business like lush</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.450" end="00:26:50.040" style="s2">grows the demand we&#39;re not talking or</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.330" end="00:26:53.640" style="s2">can you send us a hundred liters of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.040" end="00:26:56.550" style="s2">olive oil or fifty like we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.640" end="00:27:00.050" style="s2">talking about production that is so</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.550" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">large that the administrative effort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.050" end="00:27:06.240" style="s2">getting it from 50 small producers</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:10.650" style="s2">rather than one large producers brings</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:14.250" style="s2">up the cost hugely insecurity but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.650" end="00:27:16.350" style="s2">the question is it really because in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.250" end="00:27:20.280" style="s2">way it&#39;s more resilient to have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.350" end="00:27:22.920" style="s2">diverse suppliers and it always makes me</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.280" end="00:27:25.770" style="s2">think of like this recent like a years</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.920" end="00:27:26.850" style="s2">ago when Avant Kanade published</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.770" end="00:27:29.550" style="s2">something where he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.850" end="00:27:31.110" style="s2">lamenting that basically along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.550" end="00:27:32.970" style="s2">of they called me up and they said</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.110" end="00:27:34.050" style="s2">Patagonia is a billion-dollar business</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.970" end="00:27:37.470" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.050" end="00:27:40.950" style="s2">I was I was dreading that moment and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.470" end="00:27:45.030" style="s2">can I do what I&#39;m wanting to do company</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.950" end="00:27:47.070" style="s2">that big I&#39;m too big not to fail and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.030" end="00:27:49.410" style="s2">I find that fascinating because it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.070" end="00:27:52.440" style="s2">even with it with the kind of I know it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.410" end="00:27:56.040" style="s2">like having talked to Simon and I deeply</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.440" end="00:27:59.400" style="s2">believe in the commitment of the impulse</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.040" end="00:28:01.590" style="s2">of lush and like they are basically but</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.400" end="00:28:03.930" style="s2">whatever the real the company name is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.590" end="00:28:06.750" style="s2">cosmetic warriors rather than the lush</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.930" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a bunch of activists it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.750" end="00:28:11.610" style="s2">started a company rather than a company</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:14.100" style="s2">that did some active yeah which which I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.610" end="00:28:16.470" style="s2">really when I&#39;ve learned that I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.100" end="00:28:18.600" style="s2">deeply impressed by that ethos but then</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.470" end="00:28:20.610" style="s2">they&#39;re still stuck between a rock and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.600" end="00:28:22.230" style="s2">hard place it&#39;s the this conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.610" end="00:28:24.780" style="s2">can you build a regenerative company in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.230" end="00:28:28.620" style="s2">a degenerative economy and that kills</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.780" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">that just don&#39;t work and and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.620" end="00:28:33.660" style="s2">that that the the big challenge for all</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:35.400" style="s2">these these leading companies is poor</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.660" end="00:28:39.390" style="s2">like what we&#39;re talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.400" end="00:28:41.280" style="s2">subsidiarity I can we build that into</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.390" end="00:28:43.320" style="s2">company structures how can we build</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.280" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">mobile networks of lots of small</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.320" end="00:28:48.890" style="s2">companies that somehow still create</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:52.679" style="s2">collaborative advantage between them em</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.890" end="00:28:55.530" style="s2">but where the supply chains are just</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.679" end="00:28:59.670" style="s2">smaller where Russia becomes many many</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.530" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">lushes everywhere yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.670" end="00:29:04.200" style="s2">we always like to use the idea we talked</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:06.179" style="s2">a lot about this with Tamara and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.200" end="00:29:08.330" style="s2">blueprints is like human scale you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.179" end="00:29:11.130" style="s2">how can we have human scale developments</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.330" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">and and then I mean at large sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.130" end="00:29:16.169" style="s2">we do feel like wow you know there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:19.169" style="s2">this enormous business now which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.169" end="00:29:21.900" style="s2">super complex and then if you try to if</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.169" end="00:29:23.640" style="s2">you if you have a central brand you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.900" end="00:29:27.210" style="s2">the more the business grows the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.640" end="00:29:28.679" style="s2">complex it is to build coherence right</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.210" end="00:29:34.470" style="s2">and you want to build some coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.679" end="00:29:37.559" style="s2">the system and then and then something</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.470" end="00:29:39.690" style="s2">that but also like I&#39;m a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.559" end="00:29:42.450" style="s2">dreamer and I know I&#39;m like super utopic</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.690" end="00:29:44.850" style="s2">but what I mean what I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.450" end="00:29:46.200" style="s2">talk about more recently is the earlier</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.850" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">conversation we were having as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.200" end="00:29:51.059" style="s2">about like transformative change you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:54.929" style="s2">know an incremental change so how can we</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.059" end="00:29:56.820" style="s2">grow the business while transforming the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.929" end="00:29:58.380" style="s2">system that we&#39;re sitting in and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.820" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">the thing of like you know we have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.380" end="00:30:02.040" style="s2">Train on the track and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:03.990" style="s2">change the track as the Train is running</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.040" end="00:30:05.370" style="s2">on top of the track I don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.990" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">it&#39;s possible but I&#39;d like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.370" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">commitment I keep joking how can we</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:11.700" style="s2">create the post capitalism while being</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:14.250" style="s2">inside capitalism and create a business</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.700" end="00:30:16.110" style="s2">that can actually build a bridge to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.250" end="00:30:17.790" style="s2">post capitalist world I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.110" end="00:30:20.010" style="s2">interesting challenge for brands now</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.790" end="00:30:23.250" style="s2">like we know we know capitalism has</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.010" end="00:30:25.980" style="s2">failed so what is our role in helping to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.250" end="00:30:28.410" style="s2">redesign the post capitalist world and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.980" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">like help redesign this new economy</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.410" end="00:30:33.720" style="s2">system but in order to be alive so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.090" style="s2">can redesign it we also need to survive</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.720" end="00:30:39.000" style="s2">now in the current system I see that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.090" end="00:30:40.380" style="s2">this is the paradigm so and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.000" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">lush has been doing really well is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.380" end="00:30:45.510" style="s2">seeding a lot of things and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:48.600" style="s2">initiatives that can exist outside of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.510" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">lush and I&#39;m I think we could even do</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.600" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">that more where I see lush as an</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:54.250" style="s2">ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.590" style="s2">different business entities and if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.250" end="00:30:59.110" style="s2">can really like in in true regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.590" end="00:31:01.150" style="s2">design think what&#39;s the essence and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.110" end="00:31:05.730" style="s2">potential each one of those entities</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.150" end="00:31:10.120" style="s2">that allows them to honestly develop in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.730" end="00:31:12.460" style="s2">not in a complete dependency to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.120" end="00:31:14.740" style="s2">zeeco system but actually developing its</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.460" end="00:31:16.360" style="s2">own right so we forget to the point</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.740" end="00:31:18.460" style="s2">where we need to you know read</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.360" end="00:31:19.809" style="s2">regionalize everything and supply the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.460" end="00:31:22.330" style="s2">global supply chains are completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.809" end="00:31:25.450" style="s2">broken we can still survive like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.330" end="00:31:27.160" style="s2">know slime molds you know like now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.450" end="00:31:29.080" style="s2">like one organism but how can we</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.160" end="00:31:31.300" style="s2">strengthen all the individual parts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.080" end="00:31:32.740" style="s2">this organism so they fully understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.300" end="00:31:35.470" style="s2">what their potential is and then when</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.740" end="00:31:38.110" style="s2">it&#39;s time you know to feed and to grow</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.470" end="00:31:40.150" style="s2">they can be there on their own entity in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.110" end="00:31:42.610" style="s2">many ways it&#39;s in just the business</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.150" end="00:31:45.100" style="s2">world question it&#39;s the same question</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.610" end="00:31:49.330" style="s2">that I feel like we&#39;re actually having</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.100" end="00:31:52.870" style="s2">to grapple with globally as a species</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.330" end="00:31:56.620" style="s2">like in this this wonderful definition</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.870" end="00:31:59.340" style="s2">that Jon Stewart has of how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.620" end="00:32:02.140" style="s2">works it&#39;s it&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:03.940" style="s2">diversification and then subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.140" end="00:32:06.010" style="s2">reintegration of that diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.940" end="00:32:10.260" style="s2">higher levels of complexity in emerging</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.010" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">and and that this reintegration of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.260" end="00:32:15.160" style="s2">diversity at higher level of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:18.340" style="s2">can only happen through the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.160" end="00:32:20.710" style="s2">new patterns of cooperation and and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.340" end="00:32:25.050" style="s2">and through our life that&#39;s that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.710" end="00:32:28.120" style="s2">it has worked and but that means that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.050" end="00:32:31.330" style="s2">in the push towards this globalization</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.120" end="00:32:32.830" style="s2">thing that that had lots of negative</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.330" end="00:32:36.130" style="s2">impacts but also had some positive</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.830" end="00:32:38.710" style="s2">impacts and and it&#39;s what we&#39;ve now got</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.130" end="00:32:42.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s no point in arguing about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.710" end="00:32:44.650" style="s2">the past day anymore and it&#39;s how do we</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.490" end="00:32:47.770" style="s2">make it healthy is to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.650" end="00:32:50.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve we focused so much on the global</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.770" end="00:32:53.320" style="s2">and the large on the on the economics of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.290" end="00:32:56.710" style="s2">scale on efficiency that that we we</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.320" end="00:32:59.260" style="s2">eroded the patterns of redundancy and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.710" end="00:33:03.010" style="s2">duplicating at multiple scales in order</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.260" end="00:33:03.830" style="s2">to create capacity for self regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.010" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.830" end="00:33:11.210" style="s2">of the whole and so so whether it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:15.860" style="s2">our political systems in our companies</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.210" end="00:33:19.299" style="s2">in in the way we live our lives we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.860" end="00:33:21.740" style="s2">not giving up the global it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.299" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">strengthening it by becoming much more</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.740" end="00:33:27.169" style="s2">local and regional again and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:29.899" style="s2">that like if companies move into that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.169" end="00:33:33.230" style="s2">space of like taking for example the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.899" end="00:33:34.700" style="s2">circular economy pretty serious and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.230" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">particularly the insights from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.700" end="00:33:40.100" style="s2">earliest industrial ecologists that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:44.539" style="s2">biggest bang for your buck in circular</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.100" end="00:33:46.610" style="s2">economy is when you shrink the magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.539" end="00:33:48.440" style="s2">of the cycle like when you when you make</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.610" end="00:33:51.919" style="s2">it more local more regional you can get</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.440" end="00:33:54.860" style="s2">much more efficiencies or right practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.919" end="00:33:57.159" style="s2">at that local level but of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.860" end="00:34:01.309" style="s2">current economic system that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.159" end="00:34:03.470" style="s2">it would only work if we go out of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.309" end="00:34:05.330" style="s2">bubble of the three sectors like M</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.470" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">that&#39;s when you have to have a political</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.330" end="00:34:09.560" style="s2">conversation with the people in there in</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:11.899" style="s2">the region and saying we as a company</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.560" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">want to devolve into really becoming</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.899" end="00:34:17.659" style="s2">supportive actors in this region but</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:20.540" style="s2">that means we need conditions that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.659" end="00:34:24.710" style="s2">enable us to do this with you across</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.540" end="00:34:30.760" style="s2">sectors because it&#39;s like wait if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.710" end="00:34:35.500" style="s2">don&#39;t somehow in wrote this business</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.760" end="00:34:39.560" style="s2">public authority civil society</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.500" end="00:34:41.570" style="s2">separation create integrated community</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.560" end="00:34:43.399" style="s2">solutions but then we&#39;re back to honor</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.570" end="00:34:45.830" style="s2">give them right we&#39;re like the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.399" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">workers own the means of production</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.830" end="00:34:52.369" style="s2">right that there is no and again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:54.500" style="s2">gonna say something really really</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.369" end="00:34:56.960" style="s2">revolutionary in which is about private</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.500" end="00:34:58.700" style="s2">property right so he nature there is no</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.960" end="00:35:01.990" style="s2">such thing as private property so for</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.700" end="00:35:04.849" style="s2">you to to go beyond these three sectors</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.990" end="00:35:06.650" style="s2">like also ownership needs to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.849" end="00:35:07.910" style="s2">hands of the people and not in the hands</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.650" end="00:35:10.970" style="s2">of the shareholders that are always</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.910" end="00:35:13.250" style="s2">maximize maximizing shareholder value so</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.970" end="00:35:15.619" style="s2">so and this is why governance and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.250" end="00:35:17.710" style="s2">ownership is a big conversation and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.619" end="00:35:20.920" style="s2">is why</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.710" end="00:35:22.359" style="s2">I are you worried that sometimes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.920" end="00:35:23.859" style="s2">the regenerative movement or the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.359" end="00:35:26.770" style="s2">permaculture movement they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.859" end="00:35:28.030" style="s2">political enough because the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.770" end="00:35:31.420" style="s2">changes that we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.030" end="00:35:33.339" style="s2">can truly only happen if we also own</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.420" end="00:35:35.559" style="s2">that everything is political and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.339" end="00:35:37.540" style="s2">the movement is also political and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.559" end="00:35:39.819" style="s2">know how how are we going to create the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.540" end="00:35:42.099" style="s2">new kinds of regenerative politics and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.819" end="00:35:43.869" style="s2">regenerative governance to support</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.099" end="00:35:45.819" style="s2">regenerative agriculture and to support</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.869" end="00:35:50.470" style="s2">regenerative manufacturing work you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.819" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">um yeah so I think that&#39;s one one thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.470" end="00:35:56.710" style="s2">that I wanted to just park there for now</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:59.140" style="s2">and and be other about a real</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.710" end="00:36:03.069" style="s2">localization it&#39;s at the moment as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.140" end="00:36:04.690" style="s2">like for example what we see a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.069" end="00:36:06.490" style="s2">that because we&#39;ve developed global</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.690" end="00:36:08.349" style="s2">supply chains and we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.490" end="00:36:10.780" style="s2">developing countries that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.349" end="00:36:13.150" style="s2">basically their economies completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.780" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">reliant on commodities like Brazil like</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.150" end="00:36:20.619" style="s2">like Sierra Leone so we wanted some new</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.420" style="s2">cocoa butter because we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.619" end="00:36:24.460" style="s2">launch a new product and are like okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.420" end="00:36:26.980" style="s2">let&#39;s find you know a really super</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.460" end="00:36:30.250" style="s2">beautiful cocoa butter and then because</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.980" end="00:36:34.630" style="s2">we have the ecosystem of lush which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.250" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">global and has scale we can also support</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.630" end="00:36:39.010" style="s2">really incredible projects for bio</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:41.410" style="s2">regional development so so you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.010" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">often i and i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.410" end="00:36:45.579" style="s2">this to Lush i think now it has finally</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:47.260" style="s2">being understood sometimes we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.579" end="00:36:49.510" style="s2">to do anything we just need to be the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.260" end="00:36:50.829" style="s2">private sector partner you know when</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.510" end="00:36:53.230" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about these blended</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.829" end="00:36:55.569" style="s2">finance or blended models that go above</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.230" end="00:36:58.630" style="s2">you know by region or landscape</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.569" end="00:37:01.230" style="s2">integrated management it&#39;s amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.630" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">have the power of a large private sector</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.230" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">actor that can come and say we&#39;ll buy</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">your product get the finance get the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">development get the governance right all</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.930" end="00:37:12.609" style="s2">we can do is buy your product you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:14.920" style="s2">guaranteed market also there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.609" end="00:37:17.980" style="s2">enormous power in that at the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.920" end="00:37:21.339" style="s2">it&#39;s like it really for me this but we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.980" end="00:37:23.140" style="s2">need to have the transitional roadmap I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.339" end="00:37:24.540" style="s2">also don&#39;t my calling in a row map we</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.140" end="00:37:28.470" style="s2">need we need to have the right</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.540" end="00:37:31.420" style="s2">presupposing place that can guide the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.470" end="00:37:33.880" style="s2">evolution of the system into</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.420" end="00:37:36.520" style="s2">into this new integrated levels you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.880" end="00:37:39.460" style="s2">of complexity and order which for me now</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.520" end="00:37:41.740" style="s2">at least in the human in human nature is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.460" end="00:37:44.950" style="s2">the post capitalist world right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.740" end="00:37:47.560" style="s2">diversify lots of multiple parallel</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.950" end="00:37:49.960" style="s2">experiments like happening nature so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.560" end="00:37:54.130" style="s2">can integrate at the higher level harder</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.960" end="00:37:57.010" style="s2">and you know the free nature where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.130" end="00:37:58.630" style="s2">integrated but yeah I don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.010" end="00:38:02.440" style="s2">there yet I think we&#39;re done folding</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.630" end="00:38:06.490" style="s2">yeah I mean that&#39;s why like Joanna</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.440" end="00:38:09.070" style="s2">Macy&#39;s image of the hospice in midwifing</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.490" end="00:38:12.310" style="s2">and the dyeing system and the birthing</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.070" end="00:38:14.200" style="s2">system is it&#39;s it&#39;s a long journey and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.310" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s been going on for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.200" end="00:38:17.830" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of accelerating to some</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:21.190" style="s2">extent that we&#39;re now seeing that this</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.830" end="00:38:25.570" style="s2">system is clearly dying but but up what</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.190" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">I recently really connected with deeper</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.570" end="00:38:33.010" style="s2">in this metaphor is that if you call it</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:37.420" style="s2">Hospice in mmm Hospice my father I</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.010" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">realized that all the anger and all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.420" end="00:38:42.810" style="s2">boy that wasn&#39;t right that you did back</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:45.550" style="s2">then and all that it disappeared the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.810" end="00:38:48.930" style="s2">judgment was gone and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.550" end="00:38:52.840" style="s2">celebration and a forgiving of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.930" end="00:38:55.000" style="s2">understanding that he himself was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.840" end="00:39:00.190" style="s2">traumatized and wounded being and tried</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.000" end="00:39:01.780" style="s2">his best in his way and and so I could</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.190" end="00:39:04.390" style="s2">be with him in a different way and in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.780" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">similar way I find that we&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.390" end="00:39:11.140" style="s2">the hospice in right if we yell at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:13.630" style="s2">perpetrators of the dying system and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.140" end="00:39:29.910" style="s2">very few of them were like some of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.630" end="00:39:33.370" style="s2">are real perpetrators like yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.910" end="00:39:35.470" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that most it</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.370" end="00:39:37.000" style="s2">brings us back to like for example I</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.470" end="00:39:39.330" style="s2">have a little bit of connection to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.000" end="00:39:41.380" style="s2">whole impulse of future stewards and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.330" end="00:39:43.180" style="s2">Nigel&#39;s hopping in with that we mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.380" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">business alliance and and how they</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.180" end="00:39:48.100" style="s2">really work with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:49.660" style="s2">process now to to move forward the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.100" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">role of large industries in in</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.660" end="00:39:54.370" style="s2">decarbonization and all that and I know</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:56.590" style="s2">how many activist friends of mine would</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.370" end="00:39:58.780" style="s2">feel that were world highly suspicious</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.590" end="00:40:00.040" style="s2">and so on the same with like that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:07.210" style="s2">wonderful work that Christiana Figueres</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.040" end="00:40:10.330" style="s2">and and Connick have done with the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.210" end="00:40:13.030" style="s2">we create and they in that process</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.330" end="00:40:15.820" style="s2">they&#39;re still dealing with that system</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.030" end="00:40:18.670" style="s2">and and but I know that they have deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.820" end="00:40:21.010" style="s2">integrity and really can really really</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.670" end="00:40:24.310" style="s2">want to be of service and and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.010" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like I want to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.310" end="00:40:31.540" style="s2">that is the private property on on one</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:33.430" style="s2">level I like I can consents in me</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.540" end="00:40:40.900" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of two responses to that on</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.430" end="00:40:43.840" style="s2">one level um I&#39;ve also in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.900" end="00:40:45.880" style="s2">weeks like actually in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.840" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">with John Fullerton it sort of landed in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.880" end="00:40:55.000" style="s2">me completely that that one one way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">summing it all up and did is rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.000" end="00:41:00.790" style="s2">all indigenous knowledge from all</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:03.940" style="s2">corners of the world is that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.790" end="00:41:06.700" style="s2">literally is a fundamental mistake to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.940" end="00:41:09.570" style="s2">believe that the land can belong to us</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.700" end="00:41:12.520" style="s2">rather than understand that we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.570" end="00:41:16.510" style="s2">expressions of the land we belong to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.520" end="00:41:19.150" style="s2">land and in the only way we can live in</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.510" end="00:41:22.840" style="s2">serving our enlightened self-interest is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.150" end="00:41:25.420" style="s2">to heal and contribute to the abundance</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.840" end="00:41:27.450" style="s2">of the land that we are an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.420" end="00:41:34.090" style="s2">that we are means of generating</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.450" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">abundance for through ass and em and on</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.090" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">that level I completely agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:43.540" style="s2">that on the other hand I uh I also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:45.070" style="s2">the it&#39;s the whole participation how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.540" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">we like we need to transform education</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.070" end="00:41:52.230" style="s2">we need to bring everybody into</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:56.500" style="s2">responsible appropriate participation</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:58.790" style="s2">but but with getting ownership and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.500" end="00:42:01.280" style="s2">getting rights comes the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.790" end="00:42:04.130" style="s2">of also being a steward and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:05.960" style="s2">currently worried about is that if a I</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.130" end="00:42:08.180" style="s2">know that there&#39;s huge amount of wasted</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.960" end="00:42:09.650" style="s2">interest of people who own something and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.180" end="00:42:11.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like when we say we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.650" end="00:42:14.660" style="s2">private ownership like we often think of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.810" end="00:42:16.850" style="s2">these the Jeff Bezos is and and and Elon</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.660" end="00:42:19.220" style="s2">Musk&#39;s where it becomes obscene the kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.850" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">of it&#39;s even unthinkable what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.220" end="00:42:25.010" style="s2">sums and amount of resources they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:27.860" style="s2">amassed in the ownership of one person</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.010" end="00:42:30.680" style="s2">but then all these wonderful projects</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.860" end="00:42:34.190" style="s2">that owned their land in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.680" end="00:42:36.080" style="s2">their healing of that land to have some</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.190" end="00:42:38.590" style="s2">sort of radical revolution that takes</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.080" end="00:42:41.690" style="s2">all of that away and we all get our</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.590" end="00:42:45.350" style="s2">whatever our footprint percentage</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.690" end="00:42:48.140" style="s2">hectare rich is M oh and then the only</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.350" end="00:42:49.970" style="s2">way to manage it some well-meaning techy</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.140" end="00:42:51.230" style="s2">guy comes in and says don&#39;t worry as</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.970" end="00:42:53.360" style="s2">long as you have a mobile phone and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.230" end="00:42:55.460" style="s2">everything you do gets tracked then we</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.360" end="00:42:57.290" style="s2">know exactly how many resources you used</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.460" end="00:42:59.270" style="s2">and what you owe and what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.290" end="00:43:01.580" style="s2">and and all your social relationships</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.270" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">when you and help that lady across the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.580" end="00:43:05.180" style="s2">street you get a bonus point and social</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:06.910" style="s2">and when you when you do that when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.180" end="00:43:09.950" style="s2">plant a tree you get a bonus point then</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.910" end="00:43:13.550" style="s2">that&#39;s crazy that&#39;s Big Brother watching</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.950" end="00:43:16.760" style="s2">you that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a technology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.550" end="00:43:19.400" style="s2">us saying we give ourselves over to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.760" end="00:43:21.770" style="s2">AI and to these these technologies as</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.400" end="00:43:24.080" style="s2">much as they&#39;re well-meaning and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.770" end="00:43:27.650" style="s2">and I&#39;m it they&#39;re concerned about how</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.080" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">we actually without it I I think then</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.650" end="00:43:33.290" style="s2">again it&#39;s to go back to utopia right</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:36.650" style="s2">this is like the utopia so in India</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.290" end="00:43:40.430" style="s2">Autopia where where we fully align human</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.650" end="00:43:42.680" style="s2">systems to living systems I think we go</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.430" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">back to the Commons and we are common</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.680" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">stewards of the Commonwealth right this</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:50.690" style="s2">is the common earth like the commoners</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">have items you know I love that name and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.690" end="00:43:55.340" style="s2">there&#39;s so much work being done around</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:43:56.990" style="s2">the comments and and again because this</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.340" end="00:43:58.340" style="s2">is a transition it doesn&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.990" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">suddenly we&#39;re not gonna have any</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.340" end="00:44:02.090" style="s2">private property and we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:03.740" style="s2">like give everything up and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.090" end="00:44:05.060" style="s2">like we need to create the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.740" end="00:44:06.170" style="s2">relationship for we need the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.060" end="00:44:07.670" style="s2">consciousness we need the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.170" end="00:44:09.230" style="s2">relationship we do need the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.670" end="00:44:10.540" style="s2">governance because we also don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.230" end="00:44:13.810" style="s2">state government that owns our</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.540" end="00:44:17.620" style="s2">before you know we also see we have also</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.810" end="00:44:19.060" style="s2">seen how that how that pans out and now</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.620" end="00:44:20.890" style="s2">we&#39;re in a state where everything has</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.060" end="00:44:23.710" style="s2">commodity that has been commodified so</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.890" end="00:44:25.300" style="s2">we own everything and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.710" end="00:44:27.400" style="s2">carbon markets and the whole climate</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.300" end="00:44:29.290" style="s2">change the response to climate change</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.400" end="00:44:31.360" style="s2">was how can we commodify even the air</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.290" end="00:44:34.270" style="s2">how can we commodify forests you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.360" end="00:44:37.470" style="s2">like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve commodified everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.270" end="00:44:40.360" style="s2">so I can own people I can own</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.470" end="00:44:42.940" style="s2">intellectual property which I find crazy</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.360" end="00:44:47.260" style="s2">like we can own culture I can own a song</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.940" end="00:44:51.160" style="s2">I can own poetry I can own you know life</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.260" end="00:44:54.610" style="s2">we can OG genome we can own DNA we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.160" end="00:44:56.680" style="s2">own the genome like you know like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.610" end="00:44:58.870" style="s2">crazy so so it&#39;s like this pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.680" end="00:45:02.140" style="s2">swinging to like full ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.870" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">everything and I think in this world</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.140" end="00:45:06.730" style="s2">where we go back to the Commons I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s also a transition and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.730" end="00:45:11.500" style="s2">first thing is to protect what is still</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:13.600" style="s2">the Commons and then these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.500" end="00:45:17.260" style="s2">rewilding you know and then rewilding</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.600" end="00:45:19.990" style="s2">land so there are some ownership</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.260" end="00:45:22.120" style="s2">structures where we can buy land and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.990" end="00:45:24.490" style="s2">making sure that&#39;s not owned by people</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.120" end="00:45:26.710" style="s2">it may be owned by an organization and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.490" end="00:45:29.710" style="s2">held in perpetuity or protected in</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.710" end="00:45:32.380" style="s2">perpetuity I think there are some what</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.710" end="00:45:36.070" style="s2">even less for example lush has given</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.380" end="00:45:38.620" style="s2">lucious part employee-owned you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.070" end="00:45:40.810" style="s2">so we we are and the idea is to continue</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.620" end="00:45:43.240" style="s2">growing the shares that are owned by</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.810" end="00:45:45.160" style="s2">employees I think we&#39;re seeing so many</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.240" end="00:45:47.710" style="s2">employee owned enterprises like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.160" end="00:45:51.580" style="s2">beautiful movement and I think yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.710" end="00:45:55.840" style="s2">can how can we also again to to go back</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.580" end="00:45:58.390" style="s2">to that to them metaphor where we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.840" end="00:46:00.790" style="s2">to survive in the current system while</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.390" end="00:46:03.370" style="s2">trying to change the fabric of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.790" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">current system at the same time and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.370" end="00:46:06.790" style="s2">anything we&#39;re just gonna be in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:08.860" style="s2">dance until either we move towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.790" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">extinction if we&#39;re not successful or we</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.860" end="00:46:13.870" style="s2">move towards you know emergence of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:17.650" style="s2">new crazy properties of life that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.870" end="00:46:20.230" style="s2">wonder thee I think they I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.650" end="00:46:23.690" style="s2">all happening like sometimes I I need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.230" end="00:46:26.180" style="s2">try to relax back into the trust that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.690" end="00:46:28.940" style="s2">we spoke about earlier before I started</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.180" end="00:46:33.020" style="s2">recording that that we are actually in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.940" end="00:46:36.650" style="s2">everything we do we do exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.020" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">do as that larger flow like we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.650" end="00:46:42.950" style="s2">but like that in a more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:48.260" style="s2">academically terms like I recently found</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.950" end="00:46:50.329" style="s2">myself quoting Mitch Lee professor for</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.260" end="00:46:52.760" style="s2">system science at University of Hull who</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.329" end="00:46:55.000" style="s2">I know through the IFF almost in every</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.760" end="00:46:58.280" style="s2">conversation with the sentence</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.000" end="00:46:59.780" style="s2">everything is an intervention yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.280" end="00:47:02.780" style="s2">mean if you really sit with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.780" end="00:47:04.369" style="s2">sentence pushing for a bit or up on top</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.780" end="00:47:06.920" style="s2">of a mountain and just repeat everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.369" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">is an intervention and really let that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:12.260" style="s2">sink in oh it&#39;s a pretty powerful</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">statement that connects to exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.260" end="00:47:17.329" style="s2">same place that did my actually it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:19.700" style="s2">even just an intervention because then</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.329" end="00:47:21.109" style="s2">it feels so much like you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.700" end="00:47:23.089" style="s2">something to the system but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.109" end="00:47:30.020" style="s2">actually doing something as this as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.089" end="00:47:35.470" style="s2">flow and and for me that is trusting</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.020" end="00:47:39.650" style="s2">that that will never get there like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.470" end="00:47:44.980" style="s2">need to imagine these utopias we need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.650" end="00:47:44.980" style="s2">I think we desperately need a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.039" end="00:47:51.079" style="s2">Lighthouse or North Star that says as</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.960" end="00:47:54.170" style="s2">humanity in all our diversity with all</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.079" end="00:47:56.180" style="s2">our disagreements celebrating our</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.170" end="00:47:58.819" style="s2">different points of view as part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.180" end="00:48:01.880" style="s2">life&#39;s diversity and the source of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.819" end="00:48:03.829" style="s2">creativity we can still find a common</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.880" end="00:48:05.750" style="s2">ground to move forward which is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.829" end="00:48:09.049" style="s2">common ground that all our indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.750" end="00:48:12.650" style="s2">ancestors have given us which is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.049" end="00:48:16.819" style="s2">not in service to life that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.650" end="00:48:18.859" style="s2">appropriate and so yeah evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.819" end="00:48:20.809" style="s2">one direction right even if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.859" end="00:48:22.250" style="s2">believe mysticism even if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.809" end="00:48:25.099" style="s2">really want to believe the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.250" end="00:48:29.140" style="s2">its technologies like whatever again</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.099" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">even if you believe pure Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.140" end="00:48:32.779" style="s2">evolution is one direction and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:35.059" style="s2">direction is towards more</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.779" end="00:48:36.410" style="s2">differentiation or diversity towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.059" end="00:48:39.800" style="s2">more ardour and towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.410" end="00:48:43.310" style="s2">complexity and we are you know also life</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.800" end="00:48:46.580" style="s2">unfolding itself so for me that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.310" end="00:48:48.260" style="s2">the very basis it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.580" end="00:48:49.970" style="s2">a core principle of our of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.260" end="00:48:52.520" style="s2">decision-making is my intervention</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.970" end="00:48:54.950" style="s2">whether is my intervention aligned to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.520" end="00:48:58.850" style="s2">this or not and if not we also know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.950" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">extinction is also a valid process in</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.850" end="00:49:04.130" style="s2">evolution you know extinction is also</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:07.340" style="s2">how life unfolds towards more complexity</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.130" end="00:49:09.470" style="s2">diversity and orders so that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.340" end="00:49:13.870" style="s2">thing that life is basically a sin</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.470" end="00:49:16.520" style="s2">trophic process we that we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.870" end="00:49:18.650" style="s2">negentropy that we&#39;re moving against the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.520" end="00:49:20.510" style="s2">tide of entropy in order to create and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.650" end="00:49:22.970" style="s2">of course and it doesn&#39;t violate the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.510" end="00:49:26.120" style="s2">second law of thermodynamics it just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.970" end="00:49:29.240" style="s2">mistaken thing is that is confusing time</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.120" end="00:49:33.260" style="s2">scales of physics and human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.240" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">and biological evolution and yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.260" end="00:49:40.300" style="s2">create more complexity and and in order</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:42.320" style="s2">in a pocket of the universe for a few</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.300" end="00:49:45.740" style="s2">million years or even hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.320" end="00:49:48.020" style="s2">millions of years and but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.740" end="00:49:51.320" style="s2">mean that in the long run entropy</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.020" end="00:49:54.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold and there is a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.320" end="00:49:57.110" style="s2">brilliant theory I think it&#39;s from 2014</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.920" end="00:49:59.510" style="s2">I&#39;m really bad with names so forgive me</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.110" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">I I&#39;m not gonna remember I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.510" end="00:50:03.560" style="s2">to reference later but there was this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">theoretical physicist in the UK that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.560" end="00:50:11.480" style="s2">postulated that actually life created</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:14.990" style="s2">life light like so the move from</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.480" end="00:50:17.780" style="s2">inorganic to organic life was a way for</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.990" end="00:50:21.110" style="s2">the atoms and the molecules to dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.780" end="00:50:23.510" style="s2">energy more quickly so by organizing</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.110" end="00:50:25.210" style="s2">into a living entity you dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.510" end="00:50:28.370" style="s2">energy more quickly so you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.210" end="00:50:30.110" style="s2">like life is because of the second</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.370" end="00:50:33.110" style="s2">theory of thermodynamics you know like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.110" end="00:50:34.790" style="s2">it he brought everything together and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.110" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">then for me was such an insight because</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.790" end="00:50:40.100" style="s2">it also then I can also connect that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:42.290" style="s2">even to a very highly spiritual level</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.100" end="00:50:45.310" style="s2">you know like like it for me just align</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.290" end="00:50:47.900" style="s2">align everything analyzed ISM folding of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.310" end="00:50:50.120" style="s2">complexity towards you know entropy but</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.900" end="00:50:52.040" style="s2">also towards consciousness one</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.120" end="00:50:53.510" style="s2">to expand and wanting to know itself so</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.040" end="00:50:56.120" style="s2">we can evolve higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.510" end="00:50:58.670" style="s2">consciousness like look I hold those two</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.120" end="00:51:01.160" style="s2">things like I am a you know I also</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.670" end="00:51:04.310" style="s2">really love science but really love</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.160" end="00:51:06.860" style="s2">mysticism and and yeah and I I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.310" end="00:51:09.740" style="s2">that I can hold all of those trains um</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.860" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">and then just I wanted to go back to one</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.740" end="00:51:15.650" style="s2">thing about evolution in life and ah yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:17.600" style="s2">to also honor something that I I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.650" end="00:51:19.070" style="s2">for me is becoming clearer and clearer</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.600" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">and maybe part of the work that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.070" end="00:51:23.360" style="s2">doing now is to address that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:26.330" style="s2">it&#39;s how wonderful that you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.360" end="00:51:28.220" style="s2">the privilege of being able to have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.330" end="00:51:30.380" style="s2">conversation yeah because our basic and</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.220" end="00:51:32.870" style="s2">human needs are met because we have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.380" end="00:51:35.420" style="s2">privilege of doing lockdown in in you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.870" end="00:51:38.510" style="s2">know under shelter we&#39;re now suffering</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.420" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2">the worst you know storm like they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.510" end="00:51:42.500" style="s2">in Bangladesh</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:46.100" style="s2">you know like worse to start floods</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.500" end="00:51:49.130" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re safe and I think from</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.100" end="00:51:52.280" style="s2">safety safety allows us to have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.130" end="00:51:54.860" style="s2">deeper thinking but we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.280" end="00:51:57.260" style="s2">everyone with us and and and the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.860" end="00:51:59.660" style="s2">who zips technologies and whose cultures</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.260" end="00:52:01.670" style="s2">are already so close to being</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.660" end="00:52:04.580" style="s2">regenerative cultures are being</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.670" end="00:52:06.950" style="s2">decimated at the moment so how can the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.580" end="00:52:09.290" style="s2">work that we do really be in service of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.950" end="00:52:11.840" style="s2">like support because that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.290" end="00:52:13.910" style="s2">richness like they are the people that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.840" end="00:52:15.620" style="s2">are outside the system they&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.910" end="00:52:17.780" style="s2">capable of thinking outside the system</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.620" end="00:52:19.250" style="s2">they already our outside capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.780" end="00:52:21.290" style="s2">they&#39;ve only already fallen through the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.250" end="00:52:22.790" style="s2">fringes they have now lost their sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.290" end="00:52:26.810" style="s2">of the comments they have no lost their</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.790" end="00:52:29.330" style="s2">sense of community so how how do we how</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.810" end="00:52:30.920" style="s2">do we support them and resource them in</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.330" end="00:52:32.390" style="s2">a way where they can be here having</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.920" end="00:52:35.270" style="s2">these conversations with us where they</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.390" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">also have time to influence us and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.270" end="00:52:41.840" style="s2">supporters and I and I just kept naming</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:43.190" style="s2">that because I also sense that this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.840" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">going to be the source you know as</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.190" end="00:52:46.850" style="s2">you&#39;re mentioning indigenous communities</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:48.770" style="s2">this is also going to be a source of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.850" end="00:52:50.840" style="s2">knowing that&#39;s important for us to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.770" end="00:52:53.120" style="s2">connect to but not only to connect to to</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.840" end="00:52:55.220" style="s2">create space so we can thrive and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.120" end="00:53:00.590" style="s2">develop and at the moment is just being</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.220" end="00:53:01.870" style="s2">you know yeah no wait I been touching on</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.590" end="00:53:07.650" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.870" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">in in my reflections big like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.650" end="00:53:14.730" style="s2">like for example yesterday it was it</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:17.800" style="s2">yesterday no on Wednesday I talked with</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.730" end="00:53:21.660" style="s2">Alex prior from from Guayaquil and with</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.800" end="00:53:23.740" style="s2">Martin from him and from Amazonas and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.660" end="00:53:27.640" style="s2">they&#39;re doing a really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.740" end="00:53:29.230" style="s2">partnership why a key is helping guy</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.640" end="00:53:32.320" style="s2">Amazonas in their work with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.230" end="00:53:36.250" style="s2">indigenous people in in Colombia in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.320" end="00:53:38.910" style="s2">Amazonia and sure you know that guy</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.250" end="00:53:42.040" style="s2">Amazonas in Havana has helped to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.910" end="00:53:44.740" style="s2">basically they&#39;ve helped to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.040" end="00:53:50.440" style="s2">the process that led to the turning over</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.740" end="00:53:52.900" style="s2">16 million hectares of Amazonia to 35</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.440" end="00:53:55.810" style="s2">different tribal units in nations</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.900" end="00:53:58.330" style="s2">peoples that that now have legally the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.810" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">ownership of that land there&#39;s issues</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.330" end="00:54:02.020" style="s2">with of course they had the ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:05.020" style="s2">the land but the subsoil according to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.020" end="00:54:07.510" style="s2">Colombian lawyers name everywhere same</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.020" end="00:54:09.100" style="s2">everywhere land right land right an</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.510" end="00:54:11.410" style="s2">important very important part of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.100" end="00:54:14.020" style="s2">conversation but what I found really</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.410" end="00:54:16.750" style="s2">interesting in listening to Dhamma Dean</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.020" end="00:54:20.170" style="s2">about his process with with the people</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.750" end="00:54:22.360" style="s2">is is that it really addressed that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.170" end="00:54:26.920" style="s2">paradox that we&#39;re running into with</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.360" end="00:54:28.900" style="s2">with this because the minute you engage</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.920" end="00:54:32.170" style="s2">everything is an intervention so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.900" end="00:54:34.570" style="s2">also intervene in their cultures and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.170" end="00:54:37.780" style="s2">bring a connection and a different type</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.570" end="00:54:39.670" style="s2">of so again it it can be positive and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.780" end="00:54:41.470" style="s2">negative like everything like very much</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.670" end="00:54:44.320" style="s2">linked to technology the story that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.470" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">Martin was telling is that the elders</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.320" end="00:54:49.930" style="s2">approached him and said something is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">going on like we on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.930" end="00:54:59.020" style="s2">wonderful we still have our larger</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:55:01.030" style="s2">frameworks of meaning that give us clear</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.020" end="00:55:03.100" style="s2">patterns of how to pursuit to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.030" end="00:55:06.520" style="s2">participate in this forest and nurture</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.100" end="00:55:08.500" style="s2">it that in our language you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.520" end="00:55:10.050" style="s2">with in this type of year you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.500" end="00:55:12.820" style="s2">there because of the spirits</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.050" end="00:55:14.470" style="s2">but also like the biologists would say</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.820" end="00:55:15.490" style="s2">at that time of year in that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.470" end="00:55:18.130" style="s2">forest somehow</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.490" end="00:55:21.330" style="s2">reproductive processes happening for</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.130" end="00:55:23.770" style="s2">keys he sees so there&#39;s always a reason</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.330" end="00:55:28.870" style="s2">depending on how the storytelling frames</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.770" end="00:55:31.330" style="s2">it and in all oral tradition cultural</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.870" end="00:55:33.970" style="s2">tradition that is going on on all levels</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.330" end="00:55:36.910" style="s2">from the shaman&#39;s to the storytelling to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.970" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">the songs to everything is informing</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.910" end="00:55:41.980" style="s2">people is the lifelong learning process</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:44.290" style="s2">by which that culture has transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.980" end="00:55:48.220" style="s2">that deep knowledge of how to be in</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.290" end="00:55:51.820" style="s2">place over time but then because of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.220" end="00:55:54.070" style="s2">contact with other ways of living the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.820" end="00:55:55.870" style="s2">youngsters after if they put on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.070" end="00:55:57.580" style="s2">three-day ceremony the youngsters say</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.870" end="00:55:59.230" style="s2">after a day and how much longer is this</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.580" end="00:56:01.540" style="s2">ceremony gonna go on and can we can we</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.230" end="00:56:04.420" style="s2">now get out of this poison and get back</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.540" end="00:56:08.350" style="s2">to our recharging station to look at our</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.420" end="00:56:10.330" style="s2">mobile phones or something and and what</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.350" end="00:56:13.660" style="s2">they have to do and what they seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.330" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">did successfully is to turn into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.660" end="00:56:20.380" style="s2">skid and say okay well video our</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:23.470" style="s2">ceremonies make documentaries about this</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.380" end="00:56:25.990" style="s2">knowledge it for you age group</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.470" end="00:56:28.360" style="s2">yeah and suddenly it became more</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.990" end="00:56:33.100" style="s2">engaging again and and and invited</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.360" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">process it&#39;s still questionable whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.100" end="00:56:37.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the way forward but but in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:40.690" style="s2">particular incident it seemed it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.720" end="00:56:48.490" style="s2">to help but for me what I in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.690" end="00:56:50.380" style="s2">context I&#39;ve I&#39;m concerned that some of</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.280" end="00:57:43.260" style="s2">access the world of zoom calls and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.500" end="00:57:45.660" style="s2">mobile phones and technology and</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.660" end="00:57:54.530" style="s2">and is it inevitable like is that where</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.090" end="00:58:00.420" style="s2">we&#39;re going like for me if we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.530" end="00:58:02.580" style="s2">preserve diversity do people not have</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.420" end="00:58:04.260" style="s2">the right to be Luddites if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.580" end="00:58:06.240" style="s2">be Luddites or do they not have the</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.240" end="00:58:11.190" style="s2">don&#39;t want it or if they choose to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.700" end="00:58:13.890" style="s2">how a double edged of a sword technology</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.190" end="00:58:16.860" style="s2">is to to only use it in a very limited</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.890" end="00:58:18.990" style="s2">way and not be cut out of all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.860" end="00:58:21.540" style="s2">the human agreement that we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.990" end="00:58:23.400" style="s2">building if they don&#39;t have a mobile</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.540" end="00:58:25.530" style="s2">phone or they don&#39;t have an implanted</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.400" end="00:58:31.140" style="s2">chip or they don&#39;t have whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.530" end="00:58:32.460" style="s2">coming at us yeah I I think two things</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.140" end="00:58:34.860" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s because that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.460" end="00:58:36.540" style="s2">was super careful with how how I said</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.860" end="00:58:39.960" style="s2">what I said because I think for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.540" end="00:58:42.390" style="s2">like resourcing resourcing the what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.960" end="00:58:44.340" style="s2">generally we talk a lot about those</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.390" end="00:58:46.860" style="s2">doing the planet&#39;s most critical tasks</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.340" end="00:58:49.950" style="s2">and then sometimes it&#39;s resourcing them</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.860" end="00:58:52.490" style="s2">with money with time sometimes with you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.950" end="00:58:55.620" style="s2">know opportunity for peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.490" end="00:58:57.960" style="s2">learning and exchange but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.620" end="00:59:02.100" style="s2">trusting that they are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.960" end="00:59:04.620" style="s2">like I think I I would also like to</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.100" end="00:59:06.330" style="s2">trust that the people that are still</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.620" end="00:59:09.150" style="s2">connected to a different sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.330" end="00:59:11.220" style="s2">knowing would have the discernment to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.150" end="00:59:13.140" style="s2">choose whether to engage or not with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.220" end="00:59:16.080" style="s2">technology and then to do it in an</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.140" end="00:59:18.710" style="s2">appropriate way and I know it&#39;s I know</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.080" end="00:59:23.190" style="s2">that&#39;s also a bit naive of me but um</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.710" end="00:59:26.340" style="s2">like we I mean I decide I&#39;m connected to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.190" end="00:59:28.410" style="s2">like little networks and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.340" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">most beautiful things that we catalyzed</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.410" end="00:59:31.620" style="s2">also through lush and through my work</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:34.020" style="s2">collage and the work of others you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.620" end="00:59:36.240" style="s2">like Simon and and the work of spring</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.020" end="00:59:39.810" style="s2">prize that you are also involved he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.240" end="00:59:40.440" style="s2">really is so read or a lion read - Eliza</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.810" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.440" end="00:59:45.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s the idea of working in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:47.250" style="s2">nexus between humanitarian and</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.120" end="00:59:49.620" style="s2">development but creating you know a</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.250" end="00:59:51.960" style="s2">group of practitioners that can mutually</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.620" end="00:59:54.300" style="s2">support each other it&#39;s networking or</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.960" end="00:59:55.230" style="s2">the blueprint yeah yeah exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.300" end="00:59:56.610" style="s2">came out a blueprint</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.230" end="00:59:58.290" style="s2">yeah and that came out of spring prize</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.610" end="01:00:01.110" style="s2">because we met in spring prize and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.290" end="01:00:03.810" style="s2">decided to tack to add a meeting after</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.110" end="01:00:07.190" style="s2">spring prize calling a lot of actors and</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.810" end="01:00:09.570" style="s2">I luckily also some catalytic Mundi um</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.190" end="01:00:11.670" style="s2">we&#39;re fundraising now for the second</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.570" end="01:00:13.830" style="s2">year but it was you know paramount to</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.670" end="01:00:15.870" style="s2">get that funding from lush and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.830" end="01:00:18.060" style="s2">having this really beautiful calls where</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.870" end="01:00:22.500" style="s2">you have people that are you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.060" end="01:00:24.840" style="s2">working in Carthage and people they are</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.500" end="01:00:27.300" style="s2">in Bangladesh working in the refugee</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.840" end="01:00:28.860" style="s2">camps there and then we have Morag you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.300" end="01:00:31.800" style="s2">know amazing permaculture teacher from</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.860" end="01:00:33.840" style="s2">Australia and then you have you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.800" end="01:00:37.140" style="s2">collab and all the amazing people in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.840" end="01:00:39.810" style="s2">Kenya that are really doing incredible</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.140" end="01:00:42.720" style="s2">response to kovat 19 their communities</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.810" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">by like trading food for perennial plant</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.720" end="01:00:48.450" style="s2">so though give food is people commit to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:51.810" style="s2">planting perennial food crops you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.450" end="01:00:54.000" style="s2">like and and and that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.810" end="01:00:56.100" style="s2">space that we need to create where where</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.000" end="01:00:58.410" style="s2">where we&#39;re really honoring that knowing</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.100" end="01:00:59.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re really allowing and and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.410" end="01:01:02.790" style="s2">reason why I said that is because they</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.880" end="01:01:05.880" style="s2">decided to together develop a radio</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.790" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">training program so it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.880" end="01:01:09.590" style="s2">accessible and it doesn&#39;t have to rely</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:12.150" style="s2">on technology on smartphone or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.590" end="01:01:14.460" style="s2">how can we teach regeneration and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.150" end="01:01:17.130" style="s2">permaculture godbye you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.460" end="01:01:19.110" style="s2">peer-to-peer but but also with amazing</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.130" end="01:01:22.470" style="s2">support from Morag an amazing support</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.110" end="01:01:25.590" style="s2">from a hana apricot and um yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.470" end="01:01:28.860" style="s2">a really cool I love this idea or or for</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.590" end="01:01:31.050" style="s2">example like um Boniface in Bangladesh</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.860" end="01:01:32.940" style="s2">you know he was struggling to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.050" end="01:01:34.680" style="s2">come up with a coffee 19 response that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.940" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">was more regenerative because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.680" end="01:01:39.660" style="s2">in the thick of it you know and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:41.820" style="s2">about food and cash and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.660" end="01:01:44.790" style="s2">they vote they self-organized the design</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.820" end="01:01:46.350" style="s2">support group for Boniface to bringing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.790" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">different perspectives and then again</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.350" end="01:01:50.910" style="s2">it&#39;s people from the global north and</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:53.190" style="s2">the global south and then the results of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.910" end="01:01:56.339" style="s2">that is beautiful you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.190" end="01:02:00.630" style="s2">then we have only fans I know through</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.339" end="01:02:03.539" style="s2">education as a number of projects with</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.630" end="01:02:06.809" style="s2">him yes is that still the same project</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.539" end="01:02:08.430" style="s2">as it a parallel project it evolved now</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.809" end="01:02:10.770" style="s2">he&#39;s working a lot in the refugee camps</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.430" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">within rural India in Bangladesh you</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.770" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">know the enormous meeting people refugee</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:18.260" style="s2">camps Lodge has been funding him I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:23.160" style="s2">for the past two or three years and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.260" end="01:02:25.589" style="s2">yeah and then I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.160" end="01:02:27.480" style="s2">really interesting too to be working</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.589" end="01:02:29.880" style="s2">with someone that is riding the thick of</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.480" end="01:02:32.039" style="s2">it like we also have also part of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:34.230" style="s2">team of these Alliance our people in</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.039" end="01:02:36.539" style="s2">Uganda that are you know working</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.230" end="01:02:38.520" style="s2">directly with refugees and home gardens</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.539" end="01:02:42.780" style="s2">you know in the land that refugees</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.520" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">receive when they started in Uganda any</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.780" end="01:02:47.599" style="s2">anything interesting to bring the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:50.460" style="s2">immediacy of the work to the table</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.599" end="01:02:53.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what I loved about like learning</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.460" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">through you about blueprint and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:02:59.720" style="s2">really that is so clearly and actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:02.760" style="s2">building the skills of the intervention</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.720" end="01:03:05.700" style="s2">teams as well like all those people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.760" end="01:03:07.500" style="s2">learning a lot by helping and yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.700" end="01:03:09.210" style="s2">learning process of how to help more</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.500" end="01:03:12.029" style="s2">effectively and how to really build</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.210" end="01:03:16.020" style="s2">capacity locally quickly and work with</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.029" end="01:03:18.450" style="s2">local local actors and together um but</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.020" end="01:03:20.099" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s it&#39;s immediately</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.450" end="01:03:23.180" style="s2">helping the people that most needed and</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.099" end="01:03:25.650" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.180" end="01:03:28.710" style="s2">anything trusting because for example in</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.650" end="01:03:30.660" style="s2">some cases is like really what they</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.710" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">really need our mosquito nets you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.660" end="01:03:34.589" style="s2">and we know mosquito nets are plastic</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna create plastic waste and but</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.589" end="01:03:38.910" style="s2">they have like a dengue outbreak so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:41.910" style="s2">they need are must get on it so how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.910" end="01:03:45.599" style="s2">you bring like in the sense of immediacy</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.910" end="01:03:47.910" style="s2">how do you then keep upholding this</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.599" end="01:03:49.319" style="s2">bigger vision of regenerative the design</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.910" end="01:03:51.390" style="s2">and development and building local</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.319" end="01:03:53.579" style="s2">capabilities and strengthening the local</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.390" end="01:03:55.380" style="s2">resilience that goes beyond mosquito</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.579" end="01:03:57.510" style="s2">nets but you don&#39;t turn down the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.380" end="01:04:00.480" style="s2">mosquito net because it&#39;s plastic you</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.510" end="01:04:02.730" style="s2">know like how can we how can we be</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.480" end="01:04:04.980" style="s2">constantly holding that space of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.730" end="01:04:06.960" style="s2">emergency and the emergence you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.980" end="01:04:08.430" style="s2">like and I think I think we</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.960" end="01:04:09.870" style="s2">have other partners like Sarah Kay</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.430" end="01:04:12.600" style="s2">blessing as well in the Philippines</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.870" end="01:04:14.760" style="s2">doing this work really well and and this</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.600" end="01:04:18.600" style="s2">is where I think like the more we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.760" end="01:04:21.420" style="s2">make these responses and and and mix the</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.430" end="01:05:25.350" style="s2">how can we really hold this principle</p>

<p begin="01:05:51.570" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">like we famiry generosity really grew</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.210" end="01:06:04.020" style="s2">out of the frustration of the the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.960" end="01:06:05.880" style="s2">last spring price judges like after</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.020" end="01:06:07.860" style="s2">sitting with the judges for three years</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.880" end="01:06:10.110" style="s2">of saying this is wonderful these</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.860" end="01:06:11.970" style="s2">projects are all worth like they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.110" end="01:06:14.990" style="s2">ones that came through to us of the 50</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.970" end="01:06:16.980" style="s2">52 53 that we got to read the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.990" end="01:06:19.500" style="s2">applications for the last spring presser</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.980" end="01:06:20.740" style="s2">I always felt there were one or two</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.500" end="01:06:22.480" style="s2">maybe three</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.740" end="01:06:23.920" style="s2">that I had some question marks where I</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.480" end="01:06:26.230" style="s2">was like sure how did that get through</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.920" end="01:06:27.849" style="s2">the due diligence process they sound</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.230" end="01:06:29.230" style="s2">like they&#39;re talking really all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.849" end="01:06:31.390" style="s2">right language but I don&#39;t see them</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.230" end="01:06:33.849" style="s2">actually doing it or being able to do it</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.390" end="01:06:40.420" style="s2">but apart from these little red flags</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.849" end="01:06:43.690" style="s2">that that slipped through 97% of them</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.420" end="01:06:45.070" style="s2">were just like I don&#39;t want to just give</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.690" end="01:06:46.690" style="s2">them that much money I want to give them</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.070" end="01:06:51.940" style="s2">more money and I&#39;m gonna give it every</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.690" end="01:06:53.859" style="s2">year and and all of them and um and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.940" end="01:06:59.140" style="s2">we we just started this conversation of</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.859" end="01:07:01.330" style="s2">looking more into the whole how much by</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.140" end="01:07:03.339" style="s2">making it participatory and celebratory</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.330" end="01:07:05.650" style="s2">and bringing people together and doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.339" end="01:07:07.390" style="s2">all the social weaving which is what</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.650" end="01:07:09.339" style="s2">lush does so beautifully around the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.390" end="01:07:11.650" style="s2">spring press it also makes it expensive</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.339" end="01:07:14.290" style="s2">because lots of people can immerse in</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.650" end="01:07:16.390" style="s2">college and and all that and but it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.290" end="01:07:19.060" style="s2">actually so much part of the price it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.390" end="01:07:20.050" style="s2">it I think the gift that these activists</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.060" end="01:07:21.700" style="s2">from all over the world and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.050" end="01:07:25.420" style="s2">practitioners from all of the world get</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.700" end="01:07:27.790" style="s2">by being in a communion from a community</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.420" end="01:07:30.130" style="s2">from all over the world seeing their</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.790" end="01:07:33.400" style="s2">significance and feeling celebrated by</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.130" end="01:07:36.280" style="s2">each other is super powerful and worth</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.400" end="01:07:38.109" style="s2">the money spent but but when I realized</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.280" end="01:07:40.030" style="s2">that the back end of the price was</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.109" end="01:07:42.910" style="s2">almost as expensive or equally maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.030" end="01:07:46.330" style="s2">more than than what was being given away</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.910" end="01:07:48.130" style="s2">I was saying that this pattern must</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.330" end="01:07:49.480" style="s2">happen in all these other prizes too and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.130" end="01:07:50.920" style="s2">then and then we started have this</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.480" end="01:07:53.140" style="s2">conversation and I mentioned that</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.920" end="01:07:55.630" style="s2">how about Buckminster Fuller Institute</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.140" end="01:07:58.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re in the same situation and</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.630" end="01:08:00.820" style="s2">then I asked David Mocambo is a true is</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.960" end="01:08:02.170" style="s2">the back end more expensive than the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.820" end="01:08:06.300" style="s2">front end yeah it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.170" end="01:08:11.140" style="s2">in that case there was much more and um</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.300" end="01:08:12.940" style="s2">and so I&#39;m so glad that this has evolved</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.140" end="01:08:15.910" style="s2">now and that it&#39;s actually moved over to</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.940" end="01:08:20.770" style="s2">be helped by BF I am in terms of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.910" end="01:08:23.469" style="s2">the C 501 status and all that but I have</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.770" end="01:08:25.660" style="s2">Hanna lost a little bit contact with it</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.469" end="01:08:27.700" style="s2">because of my own life and and all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.660" end="01:08:30.609" style="s2">diversity of things we&#39;re holding so</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.700" end="01:08:34.089" style="s2">this way where is it now like em how&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.609" end="01:08:37.089" style="s2">it involved so we</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.089" end="01:08:39.250" style="s2">we have an offer on the table so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.089" end="01:08:41.469" style="s2">let me backtrack a little bit I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.250" end="01:08:44.199" style="s2">with region rasa tea I think at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.469" end="01:08:46.150" style="s2">heart of it like we know that only 2% of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.199" end="01:08:49.179" style="s2">philanthropic money around the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.150" end="01:08:51.670" style="s2">goes to environmental causes and we all</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.179" end="01:08:54.159" style="s2">know you know the speed and the level of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.670" end="01:08:58.449" style="s2">regenerative work that needs to be done</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.159" end="01:09:01.239" style="s2">now so so again I think our main goal is</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.449" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">to create space for mutual learning so</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.239" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">you know the kind of funders and donors</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.480" end="01:09:07.960" style="s2">can also learn from the projects and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:10.239" style="s2">projects can learn from each other and</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.960" end="01:09:14.170" style="s2">then we create this kind of thriving</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.239" end="01:09:15.909" style="s2">fast learning space where where there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.170" end="01:09:18.279" style="s2">a better understanding of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.909" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">actually needed you know really at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.279" end="01:09:21.699" style="s2">grassroots level because I think there</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:26.199" style="s2">is a lot of money that ends up in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.699" end="01:09:28.330" style="s2">hands of the big the big NGOs doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.199" end="01:09:30.279" style="s2">environmental work but very little gets</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.330" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">into the hands of you know indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.279" end="01:09:35.469" style="s2">communities people of color and you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.319" end="01:09:37.630" style="s2">small holder farmers and and and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.469" end="01:09:41.739" style="s2">people that are really actually getting</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.630" end="01:09:45.250" style="s2">their hands into the earth um so we are</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.739" end="01:09:48.190" style="s2">about to launch our launch event which</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.250" end="01:09:49.449" style="s2">is going to be already a webinar and we</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.190" end="01:09:51.250" style="s2">also want to talk to you because we want</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.449" end="01:09:53.529" style="s2">to invite you who I&#39;ve been out to bring</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.250" end="01:09:55.389" style="s2">donors and funders but also start we</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.529" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">want to become a platform for the voices</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.389" end="01:09:59.830" style="s2">like the regenerative voices that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:01.090" style="s2">coming from the ground and build this</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.830" end="01:10:02.889" style="s2">relationship that can be more</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.090" end="01:10:05.710" style="s2">longer-lasting in order to of course</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.889" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">allow the financial money to flow and</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.710" end="01:10:10.719" style="s2">then we we got an offer of match funding</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:12.699" style="s2">of half a million euros so if we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.719" end="01:10:15.610" style="s2">raise half a million euros we already</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.699" end="01:10:17.139" style="s2">have a match funded so I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.610" end="01:10:18.820" style="s2">really interesting opportunity and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.139" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">money would go to projects but it would</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.820" end="01:10:24.130" style="s2">also help us build the network um and we</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:28.170" style="s2">created a really beautiful nested whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.130" end="01:10:31.989" style="s2">theory of change where you know we</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.170" end="01:10:34.449" style="s2">understand that change done at one scale</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.989" end="01:10:35.980" style="s2">can also create more health for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.449" end="01:10:38.409" style="s2">other scale and then more health in that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.980" end="01:10:40.360" style="s2">how can we also hold the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.409" end="01:10:44.170" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do in our theory of</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.360" end="01:10:45.940" style="s2">change um yeah so we spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.170" end="01:10:48.700" style="s2">development work in order to write a big</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.940" end="01:10:52.340" style="s2">application application fund</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.700" end="01:10:54.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we are like we we are</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.340" end="01:10:56.900" style="s2">in the space of about to launch more</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.890" end="01:10:59.060" style="s2">publicly this initiative and we are in</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.900" end="01:11:01.130" style="s2">the time of fundraising so we can flow</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.060" end="01:11:03.950" style="s2">capsule and and then just to say that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.130" end="01:11:06.680" style="s2">have a combined list of I think 500</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.950" end="01:11:08.810" style="s2">vetted projects and we&#39;ve been reaching</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.680" end="01:11:11.630" style="s2">out to the projects to update on their</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.810" end="01:11:14.060" style="s2">needs so we&#39;re trying to get a new a new</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.630" end="01:11:16.990" style="s2">sense of what what the projects require</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.060" end="01:11:19.250" style="s2">and then region uraza tree is also in</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.990" end="01:11:20.900" style="s2">conversation with other people doing the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.250" end="01:11:23.510" style="s2">same thing so trying to move more money</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.900" end="01:11:25.700" style="s2">to regeneration so we can always work at</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.510" end="01:11:27.560" style="s2">a meta strategic level and then also</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.700" end="01:11:31.850" style="s2">working with other organizations like</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.560" end="01:11:34.220" style="s2">common areas Alliance and and realize an</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.850" end="01:11:37.040" style="s2">GRC and others that are looking to can</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.220" end="01:11:40.070" style="s2">we create a shared back-end where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.040" end="01:11:41.990" style="s2">sharing information even if you know our</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.070" end="01:11:44.390" style="s2">front-end is talking to different</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.990" end="01:11:47.570" style="s2">stakeholders but I think our main thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.390" end="01:11:48.550" style="s2">is to go into funding to transform</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.570" end="01:11:51.380" style="s2">philanthropy</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.550" end="01:11:52.790" style="s2">for the just transition as well and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.380" end="01:11:54.980" style="s2">know decolonizing wealth and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.790" end="01:11:58.330" style="s2">well I had a little bit of a moment</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.980" end="01:12:01.190" style="s2">where I was felt like okay help in</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.330" end="01:12:04.850" style="s2">birthing the impulse but now it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.190" end="01:12:06.770" style="s2">of moving somewhere where I&#39;m my own gut</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.850" end="01:12:10.400" style="s2">feeling was starting to get a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.770" end="01:12:14.030" style="s2">uncomfortable and but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.400" end="01:12:15.680" style="s2">evolved from from that age was when it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.030" end="01:12:17.960" style="s2">was sort of going a little bit into a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.680" end="01:12:19.910" style="s2">model of M well this is this learning</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.960" end="01:12:23.630" style="s2">community and you buy into it and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.910" end="01:12:26.660" style="s2">like it can bury it and and also a</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.630" end="01:12:29.150" style="s2">mixing philanthropy and impact</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.660" end="01:12:32.540" style="s2">investment and I feel like that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.150" end="01:12:35.780" style="s2">the vultures come come back yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.540" end="01:12:39.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a there is a role to my mind to</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.780" end="01:12:41.870" style="s2">be really clear that and the returns</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.560" end="01:12:43.490" style="s2">over the long term through the health</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.870" end="01:12:46.070" style="s2">and wholeness of the whole system is</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.490" end="01:12:49.670" style="s2">what your return on investment is and</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.070" end="01:12:52.430" style="s2">and and so it&#39;s okay to sink money into</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.670" end="01:12:54.680" style="s2">projects that are truly regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.430" end="01:12:57.230" style="s2">because the returns are multifold</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.680" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">they&#39;re just so systemic that you you</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.230" end="01:13:01.910" style="s2">might as well not waste money in trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:04.370" style="s2">to monitor them in detail because</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.910" end="01:13:06.410" style="s2">you would only catch out of it so I</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.370" end="01:13:08.090" style="s2">think the I think the reason we went</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.410" end="01:13:11.090" style="s2">there and I think we&#39;re still want to go</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.090" end="01:13:13.970" style="s2">there is the bow kiss is flowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.090" end="01:13:17.090" style="s2">philanthropic Alto as gifts to projects</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.970" end="01:13:19.640" style="s2">and then also coming up with better ways</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.090" end="01:13:22.720" style="s2">of monitoring that you know don&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.640" end="01:13:27.970" style="s2">so much more work for the projects</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.720" end="01:13:30.980" style="s2">but there is a really let&#39;s say dark</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.970" end="01:13:32.840" style="s2">aspects of philanthropy which is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.980" end="01:13:36.290" style="s2">foundations receive this big endowment</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.840" end="01:13:39.200" style="s2">they&#39;re only spending 5% a year or you</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.290" end="01:13:42.980" style="s2">create the donor advised funds so all of</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.200" end="01:13:46.040" style="s2">those funds are invested yeah so a</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.980" end="01:13:48.260" style="s2">foundation that is only donating 5% a</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.040" end="01:13:51.830" style="s2">year the rest of the money is invested</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.260" end="01:13:54.290" style="s2">and often the philanthropic capital is</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.830" end="01:13:55.940" style="s2">invested in the same shit that&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.290" end="01:13:58.430" style="s2">all the destruction everywhere right so</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.940" end="01:14:01.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like generate the money that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.430" end="01:14:07.250" style="s2">giving away by activity and then pay a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.820" end="01:14:09.410" style="s2">little bit of the money yeah so we</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.250" end="01:14:11.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to go into into normal</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.410" end="01:14:13.820" style="s2">impact investment we just wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.210" end="01:14:16.310" style="s2">offer an alternative for philanthropic</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.820" end="01:14:18.950" style="s2">capital to be vested in regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.310" end="01:14:21.890" style="s2">enterprise because when you look at our</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.950" end="01:14:23.930" style="s2">whole like 500 plus you know 500 project</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.890" end="01:14:25.910" style="s2">database a lot of those projects are</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.930" end="01:14:28.040" style="s2">regenerative businesses that actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.910" end="01:14:35.390" style="s2">need investment you know and I can</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.040" end="01:14:36.910" style="s2">actually give funding the other the</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.390" end="01:14:39.410" style="s2">other dimension that I feel is so</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.910" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">critical that we in our conversations as</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.410" end="01:14:47.210" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of developing this in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:49.040" style="s2">beginning got to the inside that there</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.210" end="01:14:51.050" style="s2">is a need for I think at the time we</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:52.940" style="s2">called it either pulverization or</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.050" end="01:14:57.850" style="s2">whatever we were like that it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.940" end="01:15:01.070" style="s2">this process of without creating a</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.850" end="01:15:03.770" style="s2">system that that siphons off money like</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.070" end="01:15:07.340" style="s2">that takes too much of a cut for doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.770" end="01:15:10.100" style="s2">this process and to create a process by</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.340" end="01:15:14.060" style="s2">which the large foundations that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.100" end="01:15:15.320" style="s2">basically 500,000 is a small grant that</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.060" end="01:15:17.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.320" end="01:15:20.590" style="s2">of directors it just gets either signed</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.570" end="01:15:23.750" style="s2">or not signed off it&#39;s a decision of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.590" end="01:15:25.790" style="s2">split second and people are putting lots</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.750" end="01:15:27.619" style="s2">of effort in getting there and writing</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.790" end="01:15:31.130" style="s2">large applications and spending huge</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.619" end="01:15:33.770" style="s2">amounts of hours to get into that split</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.130" end="01:15:34.820" style="s2">second opportunity to maybe get the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.770" end="01:15:36.650" style="s2">small grant</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.820" end="01:15:38.420" style="s2">well that small grant for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.650" end="01:15:41.480" style="s2">organizations that are not among those</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.420" end="01:15:43.639" style="s2">500 would be too much money to handle at</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.480" end="01:15:45.800" style="s2">one moment and again blow the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.639" end="01:15:47.630" style="s2">organization apart they would invest in</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.800" end="01:15:50.360" style="s2">the wrong things they would transform in</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.630" end="01:15:52.639" style="s2">in a non regenerative way but the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.360" end="01:15:54.469" style="s2">organizations if they would if that</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.639" end="01:15:56.270" style="s2">somebody instead of saying we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.469" end="01:15:58.489" style="s2">five hundred thousand for you this year</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.270" end="01:15:59.929" style="s2">would say we have a commitment to give</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.489" end="01:16:01.639" style="s2">you 50 thousand for the next ten years</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.929" end="01:16:03.610" style="s2">so you keep doing what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.639" end="01:16:07.280" style="s2">grow organically and slowly and build</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.610" end="01:16:09.980" style="s2">your team they would do amazing work</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.280" end="01:16:13.159" style="s2">with that and and so this this need to</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.980" end="01:16:15.199" style="s2">create the intermediary where the large</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.159" end="01:16:18.110" style="s2">funds that we can&#39;t change at this</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.199" end="01:16:19.520" style="s2">moment can be approached and say give us</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.110" end="01:16:21.710" style="s2">a million or give us a two million which</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:25.880" style="s2">is still small money for you we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.710" end="01:16:29.150" style="s2">do the rest of splitting this to 30 40</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.880" end="01:16:31.909" style="s2">projects instead of one I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.150" end="01:16:35.170" style="s2">Superman but we&#39;ve just done that so we</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.909" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">just spend hours and hours and hours</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.170" end="01:16:40.369" style="s2">hours of our time hours we figured we</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:44.150" style="s2">must have spent maybe forty thousand</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.369" end="01:16:46.760" style="s2">dollars worth of work to jump through</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.150" end="01:16:48.980" style="s2">all the hoops to get a meeting yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.760" end="01:16:50.780" style="s2">then we you know so we have to do that</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.980" end="01:16:53.239" style="s2">work of jumping through the hoops to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.780" end="01:16:54.889" style="s2">a million and it&#39;s so difficult because</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.239" end="01:16:58.940" style="s2">we&#39;re not big enough and you know they</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.889" end="01:17:02.900" style="s2">are then all the hoops and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.940" end="01:17:05.210" style="s2">interesting Scandinavia yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.900" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">only thing is because because then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.210" end="01:17:09.409" style="s2">holding a lot of complexity and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:11.179" style="s2">thinking so systemically then they come</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.409" end="01:17:13.340" style="s2">they came back when they said it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.179" end="01:17:15.409" style="s2">hard we come see you into a box like we</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.340" end="01:17:17.780" style="s2">have these boxes of what we want to fund</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.409" end="01:17:19.070" style="s2">and we come for you into any box because</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.780" end="01:17:20.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not really doing pure climate</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.070" end="01:17:22.639" style="s2">change and we&#39;re also not doing pure</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.840" end="01:17:25.610" style="s2">gender and you&#39;re also not doing pure</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.639" end="01:17:27.619" style="s2">like poverty alleviation but like our</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.610" end="01:17:30.250" style="s2">aim is like co-benefits if you do</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.619" end="01:17:30.250" style="s2">regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.120" end="01:17:37.620" style="s2">put a little bit of us in every box or</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.130" end="01:17:39.540" style="s2">change your boxes exactly but I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.620" end="01:17:41.640" style="s2">to know how this big foundations work so</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.540" end="01:17:45.000" style="s2">now I think we&#39;re changing our strategy</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.640" end="01:17:47.850" style="s2">to go into you know individual donors</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.000" end="01:17:49.500" style="s2">that have already figured out that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.850" end="01:17:51.300" style="s2">don&#39;t even have the time for them to</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.500" end="01:17:53.490" style="s2">spend all the money that they have like</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.300" end="01:17:55.350" style="s2">we just have no you know like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.490" end="01:17:57.030" style="s2">a billionaire at the moment if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.350" end="01:17:59.730" style="s2">not trying to become a millionaire by</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.030" end="01:18:01.320" style="s2">donating your billions like you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.730" end="01:18:03.150" style="s2">wasting everyone&#39;s time because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.320" end="01:18:04.890" style="s2">not gonna spend billions your children</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.150" end="01:18:06.420" style="s2">are not going to inherit that money</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.890" end="01:18:08.700" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not even gonna be</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.570" end="01:19:10.200" style="s2">I learned a lot there because I also saw</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.550" end="01:19:12.150" style="s2">how many of the large foundations in</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.200" end="01:19:14.490" style="s2">California are kind of applying a sort</p>

<p begin="01:19:14.490" end="01:19:20.640" style="s2">company and I know how to manage things</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.640" end="01:19:22.110" style="s2">approach and to then how are we going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.640" end="01:19:23.220" style="s2">show these people to scale up and be</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.110" end="01:19:26.040" style="s2">more efficient with their wonderful</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.040" end="01:19:31.320" style="s2">really like not 100% comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.590" end="01:19:33.090" style="s2">with some of these large monies how they</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.320" end="01:19:35.640" style="s2">use the fact that they have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.090" end="01:19:37.410" style="s2">money to then transform the processes</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.640" end="01:19:39.140" style="s2">that they&#39;re actually supporting rather</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.410" end="01:19:42.690" style="s2">than support them</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.140" end="01:19:44.489" style="s2">but but they were also wonderful other</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.690" end="01:19:47.219" style="s2">projects in in in the room and one of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.489" end="01:19:51.360" style="s2">them is this kind of flagstone project</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.219" end="01:19:52.770" style="s2">of their work is with the Maasai Mara</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.360" end="01:19:54.600" style="s2">Game Reserve and the Nature</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.770" end="01:19:56.880" style="s2">Conservancy&#39;s around the game reserve</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.600" end="01:19:58.080" style="s2">and all that the sort of blended</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.880" end="01:20:00.570" style="s2">business models that they&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.080" end="01:20:06.600" style="s2">still weren&#39;t basically using tourism</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.570" end="01:20:08.100" style="s2">money to pay to local farmers to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.600" end="01:20:12.600" style="s2">regenerative agriculture instead of</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.100" end="01:20:14.400" style="s2">teaching and it worked beautifully and</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.600" end="01:20:15.870" style="s2">it started to grow naturally because</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.400" end="01:20:19.260" style="s2">everybody is saying wow you get some</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.870" end="01:20:22.680" style="s2">money to do the work in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.260" end="01:20:24.570" style="s2">you&#39;d really like to do it and and now</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.680" end="01:20:26.430" style="s2">with co19</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.570" end="01:20:31.620" style="s2">that whole model is in danger of</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.430" end="01:20:34.800" style="s2">collapsing there&#39;s there&#39;s also a need</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.620" end="01:20:38.160" style="s2">of not building these blended ones that</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.800" end="01:20:40.730" style="s2">are too dependent on these Robin</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.160" end="01:20:43.710" style="s2">hood-like repurposing of money from one</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.730" end="01:20:49.020" style="s2">degenerative industry into regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.710" end="01:20:50.699" style="s2">practice but so again it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.020" end="01:20:52.890" style="s2">transition like we needed money now to</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.699" end="01:20:54.750" style="s2">build local resilience and local</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.890" end="01:20:57.090" style="s2">economies like local resilience and</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.750" end="01:20:59.610" style="s2">local regenerative economies you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.090" end="01:21:01.230" style="s2">and to help regenerate ecosystems so</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.610" end="01:21:03.120" style="s2">they can really support local</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.230" end="01:21:05.480" style="s2">populations right this is really about</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.120" end="01:21:06.600" style="s2">increasing the carrying capacity of</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.480" end="01:21:08.640" style="s2">bioregions</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.600" end="01:21:11.400" style="s2">to support populations without having to</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.640" end="01:21:13.290" style="s2">rely you know on imports or or having to</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.400" end="01:21:16.890" style="s2">rely on future like barring from the</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.290" end="01:21:18.989" style="s2">future um and I think if we can if we</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.890" end="01:21:23.460" style="s2">can use that money to build a capacity</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.989" end="01:21:25.680" style="s2">now then ad systems unravel which we</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.460" end="01:21:28.830" style="s2">know you know there will be then then</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.680" end="01:21:31.380" style="s2">we&#39;re just yeah we&#39;re better capable of</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.830" end="01:21:33.090" style="s2">weathering the storm so so that you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.380" end="01:21:35.340" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s exactly we can continue</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.090" end="01:21:37.739" style="s2">evolving right that&#39;s the thing again we</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.340" end="01:21:39.480" style="s2">go back to evolution and life I mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.739" end="01:21:41.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the the huge opportunity that I</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.480" end="01:21:46.290" style="s2">see right now and so many places that</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.460" end="01:21:47.370" style="s2">are hit by a crisis that I when we were</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.290" end="01:21:51.110" style="s2">talking eight months ago</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.370" end="01:21:55.250" style="s2">um pre-pandemic situation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.110" end="01:21:57.770" style="s2">so my good ol time well not really the</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.250" end="01:21:59.390" style="s2">the thing was that the the established</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.770" end="01:22:01.160" style="s2">players whether it was the car industry</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.390" end="01:22:03.260" style="s2">the fossil fuel industry the tourism</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.160" end="01:22:04.610" style="s2">industry we&#39;re making a mint in such a</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.260" end="01:22:07.130" style="s2">way that they will I say what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.610" end="01:22:08.420" style="s2">problem there is no problem you talk I</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.130" end="01:22:12.050" style="s2">think that might happen in the future</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.420" end="01:22:13.910" style="s2">but now all these heavy hitters with all</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.050" end="01:22:15.620" style="s2">their big lobbies and all their power of</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.910" end="01:22:18.230" style="s2">influencing political process are</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.620" end="01:22:22.730" style="s2">queuing up to get government support and</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.230" end="01:22:25.430" style="s2">ultimately the government is for us and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.730" end="01:22:28.430" style="s2">an voice has been strong enough to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.430" end="01:22:30.620" style="s2">we need a different normal not the back</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.430" end="01:22:32.870" style="s2">to the destructive degenerative normal</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.620" end="01:22:36.230" style="s2">that we have before and so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.870" end="01:22:38.690" style="s2">huge opportunity now to say okay if</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.230" end="01:22:41.120" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna put what would is eight</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.690" end="01:22:44.020" style="s2">months ago bill unimaginable sums of</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.120" end="01:22:46.280" style="s2">money in political wielding and</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.020" end="01:22:49.220" style="s2">collaboration between different sectors</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.280" end="01:22:51.410" style="s2">and so on interaction then let&#39;s build</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.220" end="01:22:53.680" style="s2">by a regional resilience and climate</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.410" end="01:22:56.240" style="s2">resilience at the communities say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.680" end="01:22:57.890" style="s2">build the in like if we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.240" end="01:23:00.470" style="s2">pump stuff in let&#39;s build the</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.890" end="01:23:02.180" style="s2">infrastructure that can hold us in in</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.470" end="01:23:05.180" style="s2">the disruptions that are definitely</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.180" end="01:23:07.190" style="s2">coming in the future rather than build</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.180" end="01:23:09.050" style="s2">and even walking out of the fossil fuel</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.190" end="01:23:11.720" style="s2">industry or the aviation industry which</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.050" end="01:23:13.790" style="s2">is insane yeah and I I like I think in</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.720" end="01:23:16.760" style="s2">Europe is much stronger than in the US</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.790" end="01:23:17.990" style="s2">for example I I think I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.760" end="01:23:19.400" style="s2">quite a few you know the German</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.990" end="01:23:21.260" style="s2">government has said something about this</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.400" end="01:23:22.640" style="s2">the Danish government even the British</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.260" end="01:23:25.430" style="s2">government has said something about this</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.640" end="01:23:27.320" style="s2">I think the the idea of restarting the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.430" end="01:23:29.600" style="s2">economy you know with the idea of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.320" end="01:23:33.590" style="s2">green new deal which then literally</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.600" end="01:23:36.020" style="s2">would be a green utila um after the</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.590" end="01:23:37.730" style="s2">recession ah and I think I think at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.020" end="01:23:39.470" style="s2">moment this is why we can join forces</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.730" end="01:23:41.900" style="s2">you know this is where we can get</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.470" end="01:23:43.960" style="s2">everyone of all the movements it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.900" end="01:23:46.280" style="s2">matter if you&#39;re you know taking a</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.960" end="01:23:48.320" style="s2">reformist or a revolutionary approach</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.280" end="01:23:49.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter who you are where you are</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.320" end="01:23:51.710" style="s2">if you&#39;re working on corporate</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.910" end="01:23:54.740" style="s2">sustainability or if your extinction</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.710" end="01:23:56.840" style="s2">rebellion or you know like I think this</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.740" end="01:24:00.050" style="s2">is we can have this collective push I</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.840" end="01:24:03.050" style="s2">think this can be the the unifying voice</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.050" end="01:24:04.949" style="s2">now is like look as we start the economy</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.050" end="01:24:07.860" style="s2">let&#39;s restart a better</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.949" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">and then the diversity is the approaches</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.860" end="01:24:10.890" style="s2">right of course there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">corporate approach and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.890" end="01:24:15.000" style="s2">going to be a you know you level</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:16.199" style="s2">approach but then really also need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.000" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">make sure that the community based</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.199" end="01:24:21.630" style="s2">approaches are included and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:23.460" style="s2">developing that to not have to go yeah</p>
