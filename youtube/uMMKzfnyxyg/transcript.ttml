<p begin="00:02:13.099" end="00:02:19.970" style="s2">meta modernism I&#39;m I realized people</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.980" end="00:02:23.689" style="s2">have very different levels of background</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.970" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">knowledge and an engagement with this so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.689" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">let&#39;s start with a very very very brief</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:31.819" style="s2">intro here</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:35.080" style="s2">so this might be redundant to some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.819" end="00:02:39.080" style="s2">you and essential to others I suppose so</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.080" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">the meta modernism is one take out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.080" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">many on what comes next in society so so</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:53.209" style="s2">there&#39;s a general sense that in across</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.209" end="00:03:02.209" style="s2">that societies can be studied</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.370" end="00:03:05.390" style="s2">indiscernible stages or at least the</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:21.110" style="s2">takes on another shape another color</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.140" end="00:03:49.190" style="s2">philosophy has changed and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:52.910" style="s2">this has been called post modern and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.190" end="00:03:54.709" style="s2">postmodern and post modernity then has</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.910" end="00:03:56.060" style="s2">been twisted and turned and turned it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.709" end="00:03:58.549" style="s2">for many many different in many</p>

<p begin="00:04:16.669" end="00:04:24.470" style="s2">or period and one such element has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.289" end="00:04:27.820" style="s2">with the relativism another has to do</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.820" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">with cynicism and then over the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.849" end="00:04:38.930" style="s2">five or ten years or so people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">started to argue may you were entering</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.930" end="00:04:43.810" style="s2">another</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.810" end="00:04:49.629" style="s2">face of our of society maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.949" end="00:04:52.659" style="s2">things are shifting subtly but</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.629" end="00:04:56.199" style="s2">profoundly and and the arts are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.659" end="00:04:58.870" style="s2">different and popular media are</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.199" end="00:05:00.819" style="s2">different or changed particularly by the</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.819" end="00:05:05.979" style="s2">changes so many things it changes our</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.860" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">minds it changes how we relate to Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.979" end="00:05:14.050" style="s2">how we weave the stories it changes our</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">religions even and and the expression of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.050" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">spiritual and religious life and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">changes our psychologies and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:25.690" style="s2">personalities in different ways so if</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:28.810" style="s2">you if you study this in detail you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.690" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">see there&#39;s a larger pattern that comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.810" end="00:05:35.889" style="s2">after post-modernism and then many</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:39.009" style="s2">people have suggested different takes on</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.889" end="00:05:41.830" style="s2">this so so what is post post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.009" end="00:05:44.740" style="s2">okay that the words are getting uglier</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.830" end="00:05:47.500" style="s2">right so post postmoderns what is after</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.740" end="00:05:49.389" style="s2">post-modernism and bottom up modernism</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.500" end="00:05:51.009" style="s2">and modernity just means the new and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.389" end="00:05:56.229" style="s2">then we have cooler than you then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.009" end="00:05:59.979" style="s2">have after after than you but some which</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.229" end="00:06:02.770" style="s2">after all necessarily such a misnomer</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.979" end="00:06:05.169" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at modernity is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.770" end="00:06:07.810" style="s2">impetus or drive when society start to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.169" end="00:06:10.270" style="s2">change dramatically and take on a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.810" end="00:06:12.039" style="s2">of direction we feel again it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.270" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2">somewhere technological development is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.039" end="00:06:15.819" style="s2">going somewhere scientific development</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:17.650" style="s2">is going somewhere political development</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.819" end="00:06:20.110" style="s2">is going somewhere it has direction we</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.650" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">try to try to figure out what this</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.110" end="00:06:28.270" style="s2">direction is is it progress is it decay</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:34.620" style="s2">is it higher truth is it emancipation</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.270" end="00:06:38.380" style="s2">what what is it and in the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.620" end="00:06:41.430" style="s2">the postmodern sentiments they would put</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.380" end="00:06:44.710" style="s2">a little question for examples on those</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.430" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">narratives of progress of Ananda</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.710" end="00:06:52.300" style="s2">and emancipation and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:55.750" style="s2">discovery and so on it&#39;s actually who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.300" end="00:06:58.360" style="s2">to say that modern society is more</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.750" end="00:07:03.300" style="s2">progress than say medieval society or</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.360" end="00:07:05.380" style="s2">even tribal societies they oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.300" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">anthropologists come back from from</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.380" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">their experience in a tribal society and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:14.200" style="s2">they&#39;re thrilled and they&#39;re saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:16.090" style="s2">these people are right and wherever I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.200" end="00:07:23.950" style="s2">came from from the University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.090" end="00:07:26.500" style="s2">or whatever doesn&#39;t happen so so in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.950" end="00:07:29.710" style="s2">postmodern space you kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.500" end="00:07:31.330" style="s2">switch switch around different</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.710" end="00:07:33.730" style="s2">perspectives and you challenge them</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.330" end="00:07:36.570" style="s2">against one another and so on where is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.730" end="00:07:40.480" style="s2">the meta modernist perspective then says</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.570" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">wait a minute we okay okay postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.480" end="00:07:47.830" style="s2">mind we actually don&#39;t know which worlds</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:50.170" style="s2">are the best ones we actually don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.830" end="00:07:58.360" style="s2">if we&#39;re going backwards or forwards or</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.170" end="00:08:01.180" style="s2">sideways or obliquely but let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.360" end="00:08:04.660" style="s2">at least figure out some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.180" end="00:08:08.350" style="s2">direction so that we have we have an</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.660" end="00:08:12.880" style="s2">idea about where we want to go otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:15.370" style="s2">but what what would we use or all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.880" end="00:08:18.070" style="s2">critique for and what would we use all</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.700" end="00:10:39.130" style="s2">making shared maps which can which can</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.890" end="00:10:42.100" style="s2">help us build a society that goes beyond</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.100" end="00:10:47.980" style="s2">it&#39;s also postmodern it in it invites</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.310" end="00:10:50.740" style="s2">and accepts that critique and has it</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.980" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">within itself but it&#39;s also pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:11:02.400" style="s2">it has the wisdom of the Stoics for</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:11:02.400" style="s2">instance it has the the sincere piety of</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:14.120" style="s2">the visceral engagement of the pre axial</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:18.870" style="s2">aah religions you know Bronze Age stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.120" end="00:11:21.450" style="s2">to be really alive to be at war with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.870" end="00:11:24.260" style="s2">cabal some with nature and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.450" end="00:11:27.780" style="s2">part of life and to express myself fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.260" end="00:11:30.930" style="s2">through that and and before that do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.780" end="00:11:35.280" style="s2">know yeah all the tribal engagements and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.930" end="00:11:38.850" style="s2">you know getting new rhythms dances and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.280" end="00:11:42.420" style="s2">prances where play and ritual are like</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.850" end="00:11:44.780" style="s2">in the Yoruba communities I just read</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.420" end="00:11:49.070" style="s2">calling wrote about this the other day</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.780" end="00:11:54.870" style="s2">the Yoruba communities in West Africa</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.070" end="00:11:58.740" style="s2">they don&#39;t they don&#39;t differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.870" end="00:12:00.590" style="s2">between play and ritual and then feast</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.740" end="00:12:02.730" style="s2">so all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.590" end="00:12:05.280" style="s2">non-differentiated which creates a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.730" end="00:12:09.390" style="s2">interesting space so it&#39;s like going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.280" end="00:12:14.730" style="s2">church getting married playing a game</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.390" end="00:12:17.700" style="s2">and having a party is the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.730" end="00:12:20.430" style="s2">so so we need an element of that to all</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.700" end="00:12:22.620" style="s2">of these all of this rich tapestry needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.430" end="00:12:24.630" style="s2">to be non arbitrarily traveled on</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.620" end="00:12:28.830" style="s2">momentum then you can have you have more</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.630" end="00:12:31.590" style="s2">dimensions like that you add dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.830" end="00:12:33.030" style="s2">of ok complexity management you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.590" end="00:12:36.570" style="s2">to need for black city theory and again</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.030" end="00:12:39.480" style="s2">meet Brooke theory you&#39;re gonna see that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.570" end="00:12:41.430" style="s2">some some perspectives are more complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.480" end="00:12:43.650" style="s2">than others you need developmental</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.430" end="00:12:46.890" style="s2">theory you&#39;re gonna gonna have to rank</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.650" end="00:12:49.290" style="s2">them non-judgmentally of course and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.890" end="00:12:52.260" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to see the pitfalls</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.290" end="00:12:56.490" style="s2">and pathologies so you don&#39;t end up in</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.260" end="00:12:59.070" style="s2">in flatland it&#39;s like okay so well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.490" end="00:13:02.550" style="s2">gonna bridge all perspectives so okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.070" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">mister Nazi please please elaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.550" end="00:13:08.220" style="s2">your view and I think I&#39;m sure we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:09.630" style="s2">reach 2 we can reach compromise no no</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.220" end="00:13:14.070" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna compromise with the</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.850" end="00:13:29.100" style="s2">it&#39;s we need to actually understand the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:32.309" style="s2">modern perspective and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.100" end="00:13:36.350" style="s2">when we&#39;re in the tribal space open up</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.309" end="00:13:40.319" style="s2">for magic reach entman in a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.350" end="00:13:45.379" style="s2">postmodern hell meta modern sense so</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.319" end="00:13:48.809" style="s2">meta modern there is something happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.379" end="00:13:51.479" style="s2">above and beyond modernity not just in</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.809" end="00:13:54.779" style="s2">its cracks not just in its exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.479" end="00:13:57.899" style="s2">we&#39;re like climbing out of the container</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.779" end="00:14:01.229" style="s2">that we have lived in that is modern</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.899" end="00:14:03.359" style="s2">life and we&#39;re beginning to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.229" end="00:14:07.259" style="s2">see that container we see oh it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.359" end="00:14:10.109" style="s2">out of many containers and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.259" end="00:14:15.660" style="s2">creative opportunity here to recreate a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.109" end="00:14:18.809" style="s2">fillable Society at all levels not not</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.660" end="00:14:22.049" style="s2">with like one crazy master plan but with</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.809" end="00:14:24.869" style="s2">a certain DNA or sense or perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.049" end="00:14:27.749" style="s2">sensitivity or sensibility which helps</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.869" end="00:14:30.389" style="s2">us to travel around and organize and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.749" end="00:14:34.199" style="s2">create patterns of patterns patterns</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.389" end="00:14:35.999" style="s2">which connect other patterns and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.199" end="00:14:39.479" style="s2">that&#39;s why the world needs meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.999" end="00:14:41.489" style="s2">modernists needs people who I mean not</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.479" end="00:14:43.319" style="s2">nominal meta monitor disarray don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.319" end="00:14:49.589" style="s2">particular term and but but the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.369" end="00:14:55.949" style="s2">needs what I would call meta modernists</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.589" end="00:14:59.879" style="s2">so people who who want to partake in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.949" end="00:15:02.369" style="s2">that and that exploration of many</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.879" end="00:15:05.459" style="s2">perspectives and they&#39;re bridging so</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.369" end="00:15:10.199" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of where where meta</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.589" end="00:16:39.730" style="s2">of become now early Internet age it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.570" end="00:16:43.029" style="s2">like if somebody turn on the light we</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.680" end="00:16:56.470" style="s2">then we can have a construct where we</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.470" end="00:17:02.140" style="s2">of reconstruction like we see modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.100" end="00:17:04.360" style="s2">society we deconstruct it with</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.899" end="00:23:26.609" style="s2">you and then can it go on like that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.239" end="00:23:29.159" style="s2">yeah but and in larger systems and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.609" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">tougher times having confused times when</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.159" end="00:23:35.639" style="s2">there are no there is no scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:37.619" style="s2">structure development is messy so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.639" end="00:23:44.419" style="s2">what is going on now with that with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.619" end="00:23:47.190" style="s2">corona crisis and you have a response of</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.269" end="00:26:06.959" style="s2">borders so I mean the most politically</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.609" end="00:26:09.799" style="s2">correct government we&#39;ve ever had they</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.959" end="00:26:13.499" style="s2">suddenly turned to the most restrictive</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.799" end="00:26:17.159" style="s2">immigration policy we have ever had okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.499" end="00:26:22.279" style="s2">reality just hit home and then at that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.159" end="00:26:22.279" style="s2">point the the entire the entire</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.740" end="00:26:29.880" style="s2">looking at my own country Sweden at</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.419" end="00:26:32.850" style="s2">least the entire discourse shifted and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.880" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">became much much more conservative much</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.850" end="00:26:39.299" style="s2">more aggressive and much more you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:42.270" style="s2">back to basics kind of and and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.299" end="00:26:43.740" style="s2">know Jordan Peterson happened a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.270" end="00:26:46.860" style="s2">people picked up on that and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.740" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">it was interesting and he had his points</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.860" end="00:26:56.010" style="s2">but most of all there was you know an</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:59.970" style="s2">angry angry reaction against all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.010" end="00:27:02.279" style="s2">postmodern sentiment and especially in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.970" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">young man and a young white man</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.279" end="00:27:10.830" style="s2">particularly and you know feel satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.600" style="s2">with this antithesis which is after all</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.830" end="00:27:14.490" style="s2">what the post-modernism West about</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.600" end="00:27:16.110" style="s2">deconstruction and like these then</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.490" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">here&#39;s the deconstruction and antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.110" end="00:27:23.190" style="s2">of post-modernism in a they say well ok</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:25.950" style="s2">I&#39;m gender theorists will ok political</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.190" end="00:27:29.070" style="s2">correctness will okay open borders</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.950" end="00:27:32.610" style="s2">policies and now the corona crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.070" end="00:27:37.470" style="s2">this is gonna be a have the same effect</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.610" end="00:27:39.299" style="s2">on the larger population so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.470" end="00:27:41.190" style="s2">the meta modern movement it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.299" end="00:27:43.710" style="s2">moment of beautiful rebirth and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.190" end="00:27:48.299" style="s2">revolution and there&#39;s not that silver</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.710" end="00:27:53.029" style="s2">lining in this historical moment in my</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.299" end="00:27:56.549" style="s2">in my view or my guess so</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.029" end="00:28:02.370" style="s2">instead there is a silver lining but</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.549" end="00:28:03.899" style="s2">it&#39;s more subtle and it is okay there</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.370" end="00:28:05.159" style="s2">are some questions one moment I&#39;ll I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.899" end="00:28:08.760" style="s2">finish in then I&#39;ll pick up the on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.159" end="00:28:10.049" style="s2">questions so Dale so um when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.760" end="00:28:11.970" style="s2">finished let me know I&#39;ll ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.049" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2">question then I&#39;ll feel okay everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.970" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">to you yeah yeah so there is is a silver</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:22.649" style="s2">lining and it is that okay at least the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:27.539" style="s2">corona crisis shakes people up and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.649" end="00:28:31.980" style="s2">makes us more open to I mean to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.539" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">that our reality is relatively thin and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.980" end="00:28:35.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:39.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s fragile and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.870" end="00:28:42.980" style="s2">everyday life can disappear at every</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.350" end="00:28:46.610" style="s2">moment so just those gaping empty</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.980" end="00:28:49.820" style="s2">shelves and where the toilet paper used</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.610" end="00:28:53.480" style="s2">to be you know how that felt like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.820" end="00:28:55.730" style="s2">were in a movie and that opens us up</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.480" end="00:28:57.950" style="s2">like who don&#39;t things can be really</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.730" end="00:29:02.629" style="s2">really really different for better or</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.950" end="00:29:06.919" style="s2">worse right and the very fact that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.629" end="00:29:08.899" style="s2">everybody is talking about the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.919" end="00:29:14.360" style="s2">thing it kind of connects us into like</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.899" end="00:29:19.190" style="s2">one kind of field of what Lee knows us</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.360" end="00:29:22.279" style="s2">so our words reverberate much more much</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.190" end="00:29:24.350" style="s2">more in the same global discussion I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.279" end="00:29:26.360" style="s2">mean the Donald Trump had a bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.350" end="00:29:28.970" style="s2">side effect you know ever suddenly all</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.360" end="00:29:31.940" style="s2">the world was talking about Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.970" end="00:29:33.860" style="s2">now everybody really really everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.940" end="00:29:36.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s more of a swollen eye on Trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.860" end="00:29:39.019" style="s2">and the HP engages people more so so</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.919" end="00:29:42.259" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing and the third thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.019" end="00:29:46.700" style="s2">is that for minorities of the population</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.259" end="00:29:48.860" style="s2">who are already meta modern ish they</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.700" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">start connecting much more you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.860" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">everybody&#39;s stuck at home and meta</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:57.139" style="s2">modernism is the social logic of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:59.629" style="s2">Internet Society or the you know social</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.139" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">philosophy and cultural expression of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.629" end="00:30:04.340" style="s2">Internet Society well guess what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:06.019" style="s2">meta modern is going to do they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.340" end="00:30:09.110" style="s2">to connect I&#39;m going to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.019" end="00:30:13.549" style="s2">world situation so in that and about and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.110" end="00:30:15.080" style="s2">start getting strategic this moment in</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.549" end="00:30:17.690" style="s2">history can be used which is by the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.080" end="00:30:24.440" style="s2">why probably why you Peter suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.690" end="00:30:27.500" style="s2">this issue to me right so and so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.440" end="00:30:30.710" style="s2">there is that there&#39;s this seed but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.500" end="00:30:32.809" style="s2">gonna take a while no I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.710" end="00:30:35.539" style="s2">optimist for the next years or the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.809" end="00:30:38.840" style="s2">even 20 years we&#39;re going in for some</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.539" end="00:30:42.110" style="s2">dark and tough times because people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.840" end="00:30:44.600" style="s2">gonna try the easier stuff before they</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.110" end="00:30:46.400" style="s2">try the more difficult stuff now for</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.600" end="00:30:49.220" style="s2">those lucky few who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.400" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">happened to have as their interest or</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.220" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">their or you know Providence or chance</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.730" style="s2">that got us into these complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:58.700" style="s2">perspectives we kinda already start the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.730" end="00:31:01.880" style="s2">reconstructive work and for us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.700" end="00:31:03.920" style="s2">eager to get there but the rest and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.880" end="00:31:07.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to listen to that boring crap</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.920" end="00:31:11.140" style="s2">so so they&#39;re gonna first try the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.960" end="00:31:14.660" style="s2">something more you know easy and fun and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.140" end="00:31:18.380" style="s2">first they&#39;re going to try to resist the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.660" end="00:31:21.140" style="s2">complexity of society and and we also</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.380" end="00:31:22.940" style="s2">have it and decrease in general</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.140" end="00:31:26.180" style="s2">intelligence because of the future shock</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.940" end="00:31:28.400" style="s2">of Technology right now and so so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.180" end="00:31:30.830" style="s2">young generation that are here now they</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.400" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">actually have lower intelligence IQ bias</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.830" end="00:31:36.890" style="s2">at least than the previous generation</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:40.400" style="s2">and we mmm because you know attention</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.890" end="00:31:42.710" style="s2">spans get cut so much and so on so what</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.400" end="00:31:46.220" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have right now is actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.710" end="00:31:49.880" style="s2">some kind of reactionary resurgence and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.220" end="00:31:52.310" style="s2">and the the major and the major</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.880" end="00:31:54.980" style="s2">implication of the corona crisis I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.310" end="00:31:58.120" style="s2">hey you see the cute stuff now like okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.980" end="00:32:01.280" style="s2">people helped our neighbors and so on</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.120" end="00:32:04.400" style="s2">but people are gonna like globalization</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.280" end="00:32:06.590" style="s2">less and they&#39;re gonna like nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.400" end="00:32:09.050" style="s2">more and they&#39;re gonna like strong</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.590" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">leaders who do tough and irrational</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.050" end="00:32:14.300" style="s2">decisions more and they&#39;re gonna like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:18.470" style="s2">strangers less and they&#39;re gonna like</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.300" end="00:32:21.260" style="s2">new perspectives I mean many modernism</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.470" end="00:32:23.240" style="s2">often is described as the virus he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.260" end="00:32:27.170" style="s2">described and that tries to spread it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.240" end="00:32:29.630" style="s2">itself into different context yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.170" end="00:32:33.860" style="s2">people aren&#39;t gonna want a bunch of new</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:34.190" style="s2">viruses right and so so so that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.860" end="00:32:37.550" style="s2">we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.190" end="00:32:45.700" style="s2">I mean quantitatively we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.550" end="00:32:48.350" style="s2">into darker days we need some stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.700" end="00:32:52.100" style="s2">qualitatively in small groups small</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.350" end="00:32:55.310" style="s2">settings seeds and DNA DNA&#39;s are we you</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.100" end="00:32:58.310" style="s2">know put into place new crate I met a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.310" end="00:32:59.909" style="s2">modern movement and a moment later on in</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.310" end="00:33:06.750" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.909" end="00:33:06.750" style="s2">so so patience guys and playfulness</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.020" end="00:33:11.940" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s not storm the Bastille yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.900" end="00:33:17.020" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.940" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">so I ask you a question Daniel there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.020" end="00:33:20.020" style="s2">part of me that just wants to be so</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">selfish and just have a chat with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.020" end="00:33:25.780" style="s2">myself the whole time but ask you just</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">one question and anyone who has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.780" end="00:33:28.659" style="s2">question for Daniel just write in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.929" style="s2">chat box and I&#39;ll read it for me to read</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.659" end="00:33:33.250" style="s2">in your pack just indicate that so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.929" end="00:33:35.380" style="s2">what&#39;s coming alive for me right now is</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.250" end="00:33:37.900" style="s2">sort of the skill set the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.380" end="00:33:39.429" style="s2">skillset of meta modernism and how we</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.900" end="00:33:41.950" style="s2">got on each other&#39;s radar was when I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.429" end="00:33:44.380" style="s2">released that culture war 2.0 piece and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.950" end="00:33:46.299" style="s2">mimetic tribes and at a time I had no</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.380" end="00:33:47.590" style="s2">idea what meta modernism was I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.299" end="00:33:51.700" style="s2">heard it from maybe that country singer</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.590" end="00:33:53.230" style="s2">guy Sir Jill Simpson and but I viewed</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.700" end="00:33:54.490" style="s2">that kind of the essence of that piece</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.230" end="00:33:56.590" style="s2">was like a healthy poem Oh like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.490" end="00:34:00.760" style="s2">healthy post-modernism where you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.590" end="00:34:02.470" style="s2">the capacity to not just speak past the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.760" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">ideological Turing test of someone</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.580" end="00:34:13.540" style="s2">about what they believe to be true you</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.929" end="00:34:17.320" style="s2">feel what they feel when they believe to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.540" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">what they believe to be true and some</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.320" end="00:34:19.780" style="s2">people know this on the channel but</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was actually my</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.780" end="00:34:25.389" style="s2">therapist for two years in Canada before</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:25.960" style="s2">he went famous and Mike can recruit</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.389" end="00:34:28.030" style="s2">eeeek</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.960" end="00:34:31.500" style="s2">and like anyone from multiple angles and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.030" end="00:34:34.300" style="s2">what I&#39;m called to critique Peterson was</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.500" end="00:34:36.220" style="s2">essentially this is my essence was that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.300" end="00:34:39.849" style="s2">he was not talking with people he was</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.220" end="00:34:44.470" style="s2">talking about people he wasn&#39;t sinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.849" end="00:34:45.849" style="s2">in to their maybe emotional reality and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.470" end="00:34:48.700" style="s2">something of that piece I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.849" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">about mimetic mediation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.700" end="00:34:52.149" style="s2">something like how do we mediate which</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:53.649" style="s2">is a very Minamata skill set how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.149" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">mediate amongst all these different</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.649" end="00:34:59.560" style="s2">tribes and and you mentioned something</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.690" end="00:35:01.030" style="s2">about like Nazis UFOs New Age people we</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.560" end="00:35:03.339" style="s2">should not agree with them and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.030" end="00:35:06.940" style="s2">totally on board with that but a part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.339" end="00:35:09.310" style="s2">me wants to be able to not only speak to</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.940" end="00:35:11.710" style="s2">them propositional II as if like I&#39;m one</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.310" end="00:35:12.580" style="s2">of them but also feel what they feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.710" end="00:35:15.550" style="s2">like when they</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.580" end="00:35:17.470" style="s2">or not see when they are UFO because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.550" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">think if I can&#39;t be able to do that then</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.470" end="00:35:24.550" style="s2">I can&#39;t really talk to them so yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:26.500" style="s2">guess the question is um do you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.550" end="00:35:30.570" style="s2">this is true and if so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.500" end="00:35:33.580" style="s2">collectively cultivate disability okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.570" end="00:35:35.890" style="s2">so I actually had a long interview with</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.580" end="00:35:37.510" style="s2">genre Baker yesterday we have this topic</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.890" end="00:35:43.570" style="s2">particularly up and nowhere to talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.510" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">about the future of Education and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.570" end="00:35:50.110" style="s2">verba keys view is about reducing</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:52.030" style="s2">foolishness and so we all have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.110" end="00:35:55.660" style="s2">propensity to bullshit ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.030" end="00:35:57.820" style="s2">there there are actually epistemic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.660" end="00:36:00.490" style="s2">existential and emotional and social</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.820" end="00:36:03.480" style="s2">technologies which we could do to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.490" end="00:36:08.680" style="s2">deceive ourselves less and to act less</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.480" end="00:36:11.410" style="s2">self-destructively and I mean mmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.680" end="00:36:17.410" style="s2">rationalist have like these little these</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.410" end="00:36:19.210" style="s2">little books where where you go through</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.410" end="00:36:21.880" style="s2">all the fallacies you can practice those</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.210" end="00:36:23.770" style="s2">I suppose hasn&#39;t been shown to to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.880" end="00:36:25.600" style="s2">super effective but at least knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.770" end="00:36:28.120" style="s2">about them and calling each other out in</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.600" end="00:36:31.480" style="s2">discourses and but other than that of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.120" end="00:36:33.940" style="s2">course integrating negative emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.480" end="00:36:38.760" style="s2">so on and then creating the space for</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.940" end="00:36:42.790" style="s2">that and then observing ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.760" end="00:36:45.640" style="s2">generally speaking this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.790" end="00:36:48.730" style="s2">and it just came to me anecdotally by</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.640" end="00:36:51.700" style="s2">people around me and some people have</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.730" end="00:36:56.260" style="s2">like extra layers on their thoughts so</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.700" end="00:36:59.470" style="s2">some people have just like one one train</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.260" end="00:37:01.420" style="s2">going but others have like one</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.470" end="00:37:03.970" style="s2">commenting on the train and others have</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.420" end="00:37:08.230" style="s2">like one copy on the commentator on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.970" end="00:37:10.210" style="s2">come like a and and that&#39;s what meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.230" end="00:37:11.710" style="s2">cognition can look like and we can but</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.210" end="00:37:16.060" style="s2">can actually change those inner</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.710" end="00:37:18.290" style="s2">landscapes and make us more apt at at</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.060" end="00:37:23.990" style="s2">seeing those</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.290" end="00:37:27.650" style="s2">those those connections and it&#39;s subtle</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.990" end="00:37:29.630" style="s2">but it&#39;s real so just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.650" end="00:37:32.510" style="s2">subtle and difficult to describe and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.630" end="00:37:35.540" style="s2">difficult to ping down and difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.510" end="00:37:37.790" style="s2">catch it&#39;s it&#39;s still real so so what</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.540" end="00:37:41.480" style="s2">Reiki suggests is that we should have</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.790" end="00:37:46.359" style="s2">like a a multi-dimensional practice like</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.480" end="00:37:50.330" style="s2">like what the religions used to do and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.359" end="00:37:54.060" style="s2">and really reinvented based actually on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.330" end="00:37:56.740" style="s2">on cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.060" end="00:37:59.930" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.740" end="00:38:03.380" style="s2">multi-dimensional transdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.930" end="00:38:07.880" style="s2">cognitive science so that I mean mystic</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.380" end="00:38:12.530" style="s2">side and all the pitfalls of linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.880" end="00:38:15.830" style="s2">exchange and the emotional side and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.530" end="00:38:18.109" style="s2">psychological side of the self and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.830" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">logical side and and and of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.109" end="00:38:28.010" style="s2">reasoning and complexity and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:29.690" style="s2">stuff so so that might be we need some</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.010" end="00:38:31.609" style="s2">kind of project and that might be I</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.690" end="00:38:34.609" style="s2">suppose the II met a modern project to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.609" end="00:38:36.830" style="s2">create generative conditions for this</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.609" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">kind of new discipline like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.830" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">religion of tomorrow or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:43.430" style="s2">want to call it so that really creates</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:46.940" style="s2">these meaning structures for us and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.430" end="00:38:50.090" style="s2">supports us to be like less mutilated I</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.940" end="00:38:50.980" style="s2">suppose alive but also you know grow</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.090" end="00:38:55.910" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.980" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">so yeah just just to answer what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.910" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">said about about you know not I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:07.790" style="s2">three rules no Nazis no UFOs no magic</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">and I mean I realize it gets over the no</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.790" end="00:39:11.090" style="s2">Nazis thing because people think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:14.660" style="s2">oh you&#39;re gonna be like the anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.090" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">you put up those stickers but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.660" end="00:39:19.490" style="s2">not the point the point is Nazis are</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:24.350" style="s2">actually showing up today you know like</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.490" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">real Nazis and so there&#39;s even a meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.350" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">modern Nazi who claims to work at meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:32.060" style="s2">moderna</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:35.160" style="s2">on this Facebook profile and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.060" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">people don&#39;t believe me when I say this</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.160" end="00:39:42.330" style="s2">but yes there&#39;s transcendental evil you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:45.780" style="s2">Julius evil up based Nazi Asma showing</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.330" end="00:39:48.360" style="s2">up and they want a piece of metal</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.780" end="00:39:51.090" style="s2">modernist for instance and UFO people</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.360" end="00:39:52.890" style="s2">show up they call me up and they say hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.090" end="00:39:55.320" style="s2">Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.890" end="00:39:57.300" style="s2">awesome stuff when did they contact you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.320" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">because they think I heard it from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.300" end="00:40:01.410" style="s2">aliens you know because they had the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:04.470" style="s2">similar ideas and but they heard it from</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.410" end="00:40:07.430" style="s2">the aliens in 6 1969 you know and of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.470" end="00:40:11.220" style="s2">course people really believe in magic so</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.430" end="00:40:13.710" style="s2">hey on the one hand we need to live to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.220" end="00:40:16.440" style="s2">be very very clear that there are limits</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.710" end="00:40:18.900" style="s2">to our epistemic openness on the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.440" end="00:40:22.530" style="s2">hand once you are clear about those</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.900" end="00:40:25.320" style="s2">boundaries then I mean the sky&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.530" end="00:40:28.190" style="s2">limit in terms of openness of course if</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.320" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">we can look in the eyes of Satan himself</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.190" end="00:40:34.260" style="s2">and understand him well we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:36.990" style="s2">much smarter for it and that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.260" end="00:40:39.300" style="s2">capacity but just for it for more so</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.990" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">sewers so what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.300" end="00:40:44.850" style="s2">the deeper level I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:47.430" style="s2">the more superficial level where I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.850" end="00:40:51.060" style="s2">I have to communicate people around me</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.430" end="00:40:54.900" style="s2">who am i what do I believe in so okay I</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.060" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">don&#39;t cast spells I&#39;m a level zero mage</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.900" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">sorry and I am NOT a Nazi and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:05.340" style="s2">think UFOs are here like and that just</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:08.820" style="s2">needs to be stated because when we</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.340" end="00:41:10.620" style="s2">opened up things this much and things</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.820" end="00:41:12.360" style="s2">get really crazy and and you know these</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.620" end="00:41:14.550" style="s2">are crazy times and things are going</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.360" end="00:41:18.150" style="s2">wheel to really crazy out there also on</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.550" end="00:41:23.910" style="s2">the web yeah I think I guess we should</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.150" end="00:41:26.010" style="s2">get go on with that&#39;s really good I will</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.910" end="00:41:28.200" style="s2">ask another question in the from some in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.010" end="00:41:30.510" style="s2">the chat box but what came to mind there</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.200" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">was uh going back to the Nazi thing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.510" end="00:41:33.570" style="s2">then there&#39;s like different degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:34.950" style="s2">it obviously there&#39;s all right neo-nazi</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.570" end="00:41:37.410" style="s2">but just go to like kind of a more</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.950" end="00:41:39.060" style="s2">darker layers there&#39;s like if you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.410" end="00:41:40.170" style="s2">feel into that there&#39;s this intense</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.060" end="00:41:42.130" style="s2">fucking</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.170" end="00:41:44.290" style="s2">hatred for the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.130" end="00:41:47.800" style="s2">you know it&#39;s almost like an evil hatred</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.290" end="00:41:49.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s in all of us and building a</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.800" end="00:41:50.920" style="s2">relationship with that state like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.480" end="00:41:54.430" style="s2">healthy relationship for that state is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.920" end="00:41:56.080" style="s2">really really tough I think to do so</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.430" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">that came to mind I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.080" end="00:42:01.770" style="s2">build a relationship with that state so</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:04.270" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t get pathological and spread</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.770" end="00:42:07.180" style="s2">so yeah that and something else just</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.270" end="00:42:08.620" style="s2">came because that Peter did you see did</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.180" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">you did you read a second</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.620" end="00:42:13.870" style="s2">Mountain book like Norfolk I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">read the second one so in the end there</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.870" end="00:42:19.660" style="s2">is like a chapter called here the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:21.880" style="s2">partial glory of fascism and actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.660" end="00:42:24.490" style="s2">makes this disappoint the truth you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.880" end="00:42:25.990" style="s2">making here that meta modern is when it</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.490" end="00:42:28.170" style="s2">goes political because here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.990" end="00:42:31.780" style="s2">talking about the politics and changing</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.170" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">right when meta modernist is political</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.780" end="00:42:38.290" style="s2">then it shares this demonic quality</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">actually with fascism like okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.290" end="00:42:42.940" style="s2">gonna try and be a hero I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.440" style="s2">and like do something awesome and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.940" end="00:42:44.860" style="s2">glorious and you know take over the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.440" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.860" end="00:42:55.600" style="s2">I mean okay but I&#39;m gonna fail I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:43:01.480" style="s2">need my friends and I&#39;m still a fucking</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.600" end="00:43:03.550" style="s2">joke and you know so so there is like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.480" end="00:43:07.690" style="s2">kernel of truth in all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.550" end="00:43:11.260" style="s2">and and of course it&#39;s okay you know to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.690" end="00:43:14.140" style="s2">you know upset at injustice and that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.260" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">just have to make sure well you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.140" end="00:43:18.520" style="s2">with all the emotional integration and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:21.970" style="s2">all of that stuff that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.520" end="00:43:23.800" style="s2">anger stuffed inside of us that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.970" end="00:43:25.900" style="s2">get out and occur in the right way and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.800" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">then we just left it in there and Iran</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.900" end="00:43:30.700" style="s2">it for 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:35.250" style="s2">and then I mean who knows I mean hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.700" end="00:43:38.860" style="s2">this goes for all of us like you say and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.250" end="00:43:41.950" style="s2">so I will ask questions but something</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.860" end="00:43:43.150" style="s2">goes alive and I want to say it so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.950" end="00:43:45.100" style="s2">gonna junked researcher at Jon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.150" end="00:43:46.540" style="s2">consciousness and wisdom studies lab and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.100" end="00:43:48.040" style="s2">I&#39;m good friends with John and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.540" end="00:43:50.080" style="s2">studying these these authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.040" end="00:43:53.730" style="s2">practices and the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.080" end="00:43:55.230" style="s2">that might emerge from it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.730" end="00:43:57.369" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.230" end="00:43:59.740" style="s2">jumper Bay yeah so something about</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.369" end="00:44:01.420" style="s2">stoicism it&#39;s like I was like a secret</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.740" end="00:44:03.069" style="s2">closet stored for a long time I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.420" end="00:44:04.569" style="s2">talk about it publicly but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.069" end="00:44:06.760" style="s2">coming online and I feel really called</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.569" end="00:44:08.020" style="s2">to talk about it and just thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.760" end="00:44:10.869" style="s2">it I probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.020" end="00:44:13.059" style="s2">write that white paper without my</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.869" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">stoicism his stoicism has this ability</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.059" end="00:44:17.050" style="s2">to kind of like diffuse yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.520" style="s2">your emotions so you don&#39;t get a mesh</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.050" end="00:44:20.230" style="s2">with them and then you can kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.520" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">back if you choose and build a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.230" end="00:44:25.630" style="s2">relationship with each emotional reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:27.550" style="s2">so that I&#39;m just flaking that because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.630" end="00:44:29.140" style="s2">was never really comfortable with using</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.550" end="00:44:31.089" style="s2">the meta modern term I&#39;m definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.140" end="00:44:33.790" style="s2">a modernist stoic from water stoic so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.089" end="00:44:35.800" style="s2">might be a meta modern stoic so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.790" end="00:44:39.670" style="s2">threat I might want to tug on and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.800" end="00:44:42.550" style="s2">something interesting also came up as</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.670" end="00:44:44.500" style="s2">you mentioned that like and like an</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.550" end="00:44:45.730" style="s2">invitation and one thing I&#39;m also doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.500" end="00:44:47.890" style="s2">with this project</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.730" end="00:44:49.660" style="s2">the stoah I had this like post-punk</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.890" end="00:44:50.950" style="s2">minimalist ethics and having all these</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.660" end="00:44:52.780" style="s2">sexy events like existential</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.950" end="00:44:54.309" style="s2">speed-dating or existential of dance</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.780" end="00:44:56.380" style="s2">parties there&#39;s not critics need dating</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.309" end="00:45:00.220" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a it has like a playful vibe</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.380" end="00:45:02.049" style="s2">to it and I imagine a wisdom gym might</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.220" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">emerge from all these different colleges</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.049" end="00:45:10.059" style="s2">that I&#39;m on with Jim yes yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:11.380" style="s2">have a proclivity for jazzy coinage but</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.059" end="00:45:13.510" style="s2">even I just wanted to all that came</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.380" end="00:45:14.980" style="s2">alive and it&#39;s felt right to say so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.510" end="00:45:18.730" style="s2">wanted to say it and thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.980" end="00:45:21.369" style="s2">engendering that my friend so let&#39;s turn</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.730" end="00:45:22.510" style="s2">to if you had me a fairly thought scheme</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.369" end="00:45:32.260" style="s2">a live wait there let me know but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.510" end="00:45:33.609" style="s2">turn to some questions if not veldt if</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.260" end="00:45:37.569" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t unmute yourself and ask</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.609" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">Daniel no question yes hey Daniel thanks</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.569" end="00:45:43.540" style="s2">I do see kind of your argument about</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:45.910" style="s2">meta modernism naturally evolving</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.540" end="00:45:48.520" style="s2">through our time and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.910" end="00:45:50.290" style="s2">inevitable but I also think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.520" end="00:45:53.650" style="s2">possible like that&#39;s not gonna happen a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.290" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">viable timeline and so I personally am</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.650" end="00:45:59.170" style="s2">very hesitant to just accept that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.220" end="00:46:01.180" style="s2">is going to naturally evolve and we not</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.170" end="00:46:04.530" style="s2">really we can&#39;t really do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.180" end="00:46:08.420" style="s2">that so do you see any possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.530" end="00:46:11.290" style="s2">strategies towards kind of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.420" end="00:46:16.790" style="s2">this kind of nonlinear phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.290" end="00:46:21.620" style="s2">what&#39;s that right so so I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.790" end="00:46:24.860" style="s2">looking for nonlinear revolutionaries so</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.620" end="00:46:29.050" style="s2">meaning that when being a meta modernist</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.860" end="00:46:35.170" style="s2">actor so first of all it&#39;s much less</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.050" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">staged teleological then then then these</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.170" end="00:46:41.600" style="s2">then these stage theories or the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:44.840" style="s2">language that they invite us to would</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.600" end="00:46:46.820" style="s2">suggest rather I mean rather you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.840" end="00:46:48.920" style="s2">different waves like this and like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.820" end="00:46:52.520" style="s2">when one wave is at the top and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.920" end="00:46:54.230" style="s2">other is beginning and and then when the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.520" end="00:46:56.330" style="s2">other is ending and the other is at its</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.230" end="00:46:58.700" style="s2">top and then you have the top then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.330" end="00:47:00.650" style="s2">have the beginning of the next one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.700" end="00:47:03.590" style="s2">and if you want to like draw out the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.650" end="00:47:07.250" style="s2">qualitative stuff of what is like meta</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.590" end="00:47:09.590" style="s2">modernism well it starts now and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.250" end="00:47:11.570" style="s2">you know it has a long future a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.590" end="00:47:13.310" style="s2">bit but it&#39;ll s long for you of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.570" end="00:47:14.780" style="s2">that modernity because they go shorter</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.310" end="00:47:18.260" style="s2">and shorter because of the acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.780" end="00:47:22.820" style="s2">of history and of course there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.260" end="00:47:27.320" style="s2">risk of collapse so I mean when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.820" end="00:47:29.840" style="s2">say this stuff I mean it sounds weird</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.320" end="00:47:33.050" style="s2">but I mean I mean it in a religious</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.840" end="00:47:36.440" style="s2">manner you know I don&#39;t mean it like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.050" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">yeah so on Tuesday or we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.440" end="00:47:41.630" style="s2">implement these meta modern policies and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:44.660" style="s2">you know and on Friday we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.630" end="00:47:47.240" style="s2">like many modern council rule the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.660" end="00:47:50.840" style="s2">with their meta modern f with our meta</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.240" end="00:47:53.540" style="s2">modern information architecture which</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.840" end="00:47:56.710" style="s2">meta modern business leaders will have</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.540" end="00:47:58.820" style="s2">invented and then we will dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.710" end="00:48:01.490" style="s2">capitalism and create something fair and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.820" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">sustainable and you know like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.490" end="00:48:07.490" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">okay there is a developmental direction</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.490" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">and if you know the direction and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:14.930" style="s2">many people know the direction and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:18.220" style="s2">have resonance with one another then</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.930" end="00:48:21.490" style="s2">when they are in a million complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.220" end="00:48:26.619" style="s2">interrelated situations that they choose</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.490" end="00:48:29.110" style="s2">you know it&#39;ll be a your B then the they</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.619" end="00:48:30.790" style="s2">climb in there lay labyrinths</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.700" end="00:48:54.460" style="s2">but there there&#39;s a deep structure there</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.190" end="00:48:56.260" style="s2">is a pattern here you know and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.460" end="00:48:59.050" style="s2">saying we have it down the pattern of</p>

<p begin="00:48:59.050" end="00:49:05.530" style="s2">are some contour or so that pattern if</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.740" end="00:49:08.170" style="s2">people see roughly the same pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.530" end="00:49:12.610" style="s2">then then they can jive together on a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.170" end="00:49:15.910" style="s2">subtle level and then the position here</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.610" end="00:49:18.750" style="s2">or no the hypothesis here working</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.910" end="00:49:23.230" style="s2">hypothesis is that seeing this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.750" end="00:49:26.500" style="s2">makes you competitive in the games of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.230" end="00:49:30.490" style="s2">the logic of the previous pattern so</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.500" end="00:49:33.670" style="s2">like being more meta modernist tends to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.490" end="00:49:36.190" style="s2">put you in a better position in just</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.670" end="00:49:39.640" style="s2">just normal modernist both friends does</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.190" end="00:49:41.980" style="s2">profit-seeking for instance healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.640" end="00:49:46.680" style="s2">implementation policies for instance</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.980" end="00:49:49.750" style="s2">being on the beat with arts and media</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.680" end="00:49:52.990" style="s2">for instance building relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.750" end="00:49:55.240" style="s2">networks because it has competitive</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.990" end="00:49:58.510" style="s2">advantage because it follows from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.240" end="00:50:00.790" style="s2">logic of the previous that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.510" end="00:50:04.330" style="s2">know creates an impetus that is complex</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.790" end="00:50:06.550" style="s2">and then people come up with different</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.330" end="00:50:07.570" style="s2">projects so a thousand different people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.550" end="00:50:11.140" style="s2">come up with a thousand different</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.570" end="00:50:14.230" style="s2">projects of these maybe just to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.140" end="00:50:16.330" style="s2">nevertheless the world depends on those</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.230" end="00:50:19.780" style="s2">two projects succeeding and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.330" end="00:50:21.609" style="s2">have those 1,000 projects and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.780" end="00:50:28.750" style="s2">learning processes that come from all</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.609" end="00:50:31.600" style="s2">those failures then were cooked so so so</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.750" end="00:50:34.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the like nonlinear revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.600" end="00:50:37.700" style="s2">thing that&#39;s why it requires of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.570" end="00:50:40.310" style="s2">okay I&#39;m gonna do this because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.700" end="00:50:42.890" style="s2">structures point in this direction and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.310" end="00:50:45.050" style="s2">realize I&#39;m gonna be a fucking joke and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.890" end="00:50:46.460" style="s2">I might even ruin my life in the process</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.050" end="00:50:48.560" style="s2">and I could have been a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.460" end="00:50:50.630" style="s2">middle-class person but I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.560" end="00:50:51.620" style="s2">putting all that on the line for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.630" end="00:50:54.100" style="s2">higher purpose</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.620" end="00:50:58.280" style="s2">which my family doesn&#39;t understand I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.100" end="00:51:01.070" style="s2">mean this is a bit crazy but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.280" end="00:51:06.080" style="s2">right thing to do if you&#39;re if you see</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.070" end="00:51:08.030" style="s2">the pattern strong enough so so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.080" end="00:51:10.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.030" end="00:51:12.110" style="s2">revolutionaries we want I mean not not</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.520" end="00:51:14.060" style="s2">people who want to risk their lives by</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.110" end="00:51:17.210" style="s2">robbing a train and then chopping the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.060" end="00:51:21.320" style="s2">head of someone but revolutionaries who</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.210" end="00:51:23.170" style="s2">can gamble with their life livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.320" end="00:51:26.600" style="s2">and good reputation especially</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.170" end="00:51:29.720" style="s2">reputation you know like people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.600" end="00:51:31.130" style="s2">slaves to all these social games as</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.720" end="00:51:32.840" style="s2">status tough and so on</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.130" end="00:51:37.480" style="s2">so whoever can make a fool out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.840" end="00:51:37.480" style="s2">themselves is like the meta modern hero</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.020" end="00:51:43.940" style="s2">and and and and that&#39;s and that pushes</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.300" end="00:51:46.250" style="s2">the game you know that pushes it has</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.940" end="00:51:48.260" style="s2">good and bad effects but I&#39;m a ver egde</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.250" end="00:51:53.980" style="s2">if we write about the general direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.260" end="00:51:53.980" style="s2">I mean the world depends on it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.700" end="00:52:02.840" style="s2">Wayne you have a question sorry so I saw</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.740" end="00:52:06.020" style="s2">a few people over at both books of box</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.840" end="00:52:09.410" style="s2">ago I really loved the critique of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.020" end="00:52:13.900" style="s2">Marshalls question had to do with when</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.410" end="00:52:17.830" style="s2">you discuss participatory democracy in</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.900" end="00:52:23.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no mention of at all comment</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.830" end="00:52:25.790" style="s2">which is the process of making you feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.360" end="00:52:28.820" style="s2">like Michelle no one&#39;s from into Haiti</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.790" end="00:52:30.830" style="s2">for instance so I&#39;m curious why you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.820" end="00:52:33.530" style="s2">I mean maybe people want that internal</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.830" end="00:52:38.330" style="s2">society where I see comics is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.530" end="00:52:46.810" style="s2">deeper and stand for that period food</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.330" end="00:52:48.760" style="s2">here you&#39;re awesome you know so it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.810" end="00:52:50.350" style="s2">simple reason actually no so the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.760" end="00:52:54.190" style="s2">two books are politics and third one is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.350" end="00:52:57.810" style="s2">on history fourth one is on the economy</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.190" end="00:52:59.920" style="s2">so Commons shows up there and including</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.810" end="00:53:03.840" style="s2">including Michelle bounce and all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.920" end="00:53:11.370" style="s2">rest so but just to say something</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.840" end="00:53:14.890" style="s2">mmm I mean the number four on the cold</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.370" end="00:53:16.750" style="s2">list out competing capitalism and we try</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.890" end="00:53:19.750" style="s2">to write them timelessly so people can</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.750" end="00:53:22.180" style="s2">enter the series through whichever</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.750" end="00:53:24.700" style="s2">pathway that you want so we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.180" end="00:53:27.430" style="s2">write I&#39;m gonna write this in a future</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.700" end="00:53:29.140" style="s2">book we write like as if the books were</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.430" end="00:53:37.260" style="s2">already existent but it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.140" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">years to finish it so I mean the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.260" end="00:53:49.690" style="s2">theories and they have a very important</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:52.570" style="s2">element and yet I when I mean I might</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.690" end="00:53:55.360" style="s2">know too little about this to give a</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.570" end="00:53:58.780" style="s2">full response but and but what I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.360" end="00:54:05.860" style="s2">seen and heard thus far is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.780" end="00:54:08.680" style="s2">see a viable pathway for the effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.860" end="00:54:11.590" style="s2">of competition of the capitalist system</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.680" end="00:54:14.590" style="s2">as coordinator of human agency for</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.590" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">across millions of you know literal</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.590" end="00:54:22.330" style="s2">billions of people on the same market so</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.190" end="00:54:25.060" style="s2">what what I would like instead you said</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:28.510" style="s2">you like that our Marxist critique well</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.060" end="00:54:31.030" style="s2">I would still actually like some for</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.510" end="00:54:33.100" style="s2">comments Tyrion and all of the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.030" end="00:54:36.100" style="s2">actual heterodox economics and more</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.100" end="00:54:39.390" style="s2">progressive theories of both governance</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.100" end="00:54:41.380" style="s2">and and production distribution and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.390" end="00:54:47.770" style="s2">coordination of human agency I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.380" end="00:54:51.370" style="s2">like to for all of them to find their</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.770" end="00:54:54.970" style="s2">Marxist you know so like like it marks</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.370" end="00:54:57.610" style="s2">it in the 19th century he was like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.970" end="00:54:59.410" style="s2">bad boy of socialism like because the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.610" end="00:55:03.849" style="s2">other socialists were like</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.410" end="00:55:06.809" style="s2">the beauty and dignity of man and he was</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.849" end="00:55:10.119" style="s2">like no no no we&#39;re gonna kill him and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.809" end="00:55:12.460" style="s2">and we&#39;re not looking for somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.119" end="00:55:14.410" style="s2">says we&#39;re gonna kill this or that but</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.460" end="00:55:18.549" style="s2">we have to look at okay how are we</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.410" end="00:55:21.220" style="s2">seriously out-compete this machine you</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.549" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">know which is normally powerful at</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.220" end="00:55:31.150" style="s2">controlling human agency you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:34.660" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t see a really serious</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.150" end="00:55:37.089" style="s2">engagement with that question and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.660" end="00:55:39.519" style="s2">comments theories so I can only imagine</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.089" end="00:55:42.609" style="s2">that there would be relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.519" end="00:55:46.049" style="s2">islands so at this point I think come</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.609" end="00:55:49.269" style="s2">become us theory remain an important</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.049" end="00:55:51.549" style="s2">aspect of meta modernism but but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.269" end="00:55:54.839" style="s2">much like the idealist</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.549" end="00:55:57.250" style="s2">what like the Marxist would call prior</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.839" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">socialists they would call them idealist</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.250" end="00:56:01.539" style="s2">philosophers or or utopian philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:07.930" style="s2">and and I kind I&#39;m kind of looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.539" end="00:56:10.329" style="s2">non utopian pathway here okay yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.930" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t as utopian as it may seem first of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.329" end="00:56:15.039" style="s2">all there&#39;s a lot of discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:18.130" style="s2">precisely that whether words so how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.039" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">you do what&#39;s called trans vestment in</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.130" end="00:56:24.670" style="s2">other words you have you have a building</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:27.369" style="s2">Commons the federal economy and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.670" end="00:56:29.490" style="s2">problem is how do we bring capital in</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.369" end="00:56:32.859" style="s2">some sense through a semi-permanent</p>

<p begin="00:59:25.010" end="00:59:31.609" style="s2">or should we wrap it up right now and no</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.109" end="00:59:41.960" style="s2">I have okay so yeah Yoshio if you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.609" end="00:59:44.230" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask your question I</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.960" end="00:59:46.190" style="s2">was just wondering what the role of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.230" end="00:59:50.059" style="s2">Technology as in the metamodel</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.190" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">transition is there a crucial role for</p>

<p begin="01:00:01.369" end="01:00:09.799" style="s2">can upload so if you have anything to</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.589" end="01:00:16.069" style="s2">say about that okay the last part again</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.799" end="01:00:20.150" style="s2">like download faster than up yeah he you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.069" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">know he mentioned that we have a far</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.150" end="01:00:27.349" style="s2">greater capacity to receive information</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:30.559" style="s2">from the internet and and we have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.349" end="01:00:33.770" style="s2">limited capacity to affect or to upload</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.559" end="01:00:36.529" style="s2">our various aspects of recognition to</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.529" end="01:00:42.470" style="s2">bandwidth issue just wondering if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.220" end="01:00:44.299" style="s2">see there if there&#39;s any relation there</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.470" end="01:00:48.500" style="s2">to this madammadam</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.299" end="01:00:53.960" style="s2">transition right so so I mean people</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.500" end="01:01:01.430" style="s2">have the opposite argument as super</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.960" end="01:01:04.940" style="s2">empowers us as as ascenders of content</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.430" end="01:01:09.789" style="s2">and knowledge and it it create it</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.940" end="01:01:15.400" style="s2">creates like a hyper you know a high</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.789" end="01:01:19.099" style="s2">saturated space of content and like</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.400" end="01:01:23.049" style="s2">hyper production of knowledge like as if</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.099" end="01:01:23.049" style="s2">I didn&#39;t already exists enough in</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.460" end="01:01:31.710" style="s2">mmm in academia so I mean well let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.809" end="01:01:34.710" style="s2">we&#39;re at the end of the modern and a</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.710" end="01:01:39.510" style="s2">long period of cycling a long cycle</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.710" end="01:01:44.940" style="s2">where a long sight cycle or period and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.510" end="01:01:48.869" style="s2">and then we what happens here is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.940" end="01:01:51.000" style="s2">knowledge and production of science and</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.869" end="01:01:54.119" style="s2">knowledge is is viewed as very very</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.000" end="01:01:56.849" style="s2">important than you know pivotal and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.119" end="01:02:00.660" style="s2">fundamental to to the modern project at</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.849" end="01:02:03.780" style="s2">the same time of course production is</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.660" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">number one thing in modern history you</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.780" end="01:02:11.849" style="s2">know increase your GNP GDP you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.079" end="01:02:15.150" style="s2">increase production you increase the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.849" end="01:02:18.329" style="s2">speed of distribution and so on so what</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.150" end="01:02:20.700" style="s2">we&#39;re and what we end with when all have</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.329" end="01:02:25.829" style="s2">you know the Omega Point a modern</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.700" end="01:02:29.400" style="s2">society is a humongous deluge of tillage</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.829" end="01:02:32.700" style="s2">of you know new knowledge being produced</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.400" end="01:02:36.599" style="s2">of various quality and you know you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.700" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">add you lower the price for putting</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.599" end="01:02:40.650" style="s2">knowledge out there and grandeur the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:43.890" style="s2">synthesizing and creating new knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.650" end="01:02:48.059" style="s2">so everybody starts we&#39;re like super</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.890" end="01:02:51.210" style="s2">super super super like it so most papers</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.059" end="01:02:53.910" style="s2">never get or only getting read a few</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.210" end="01:02:57.210" style="s2">times by the by that people are paid to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.910" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">to review them you know and most papers</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.210" end="01:03:04.470" style="s2">are never cited and let alone knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:07.319" style="s2">being applied and used and have any sort</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.470" end="01:03:09.720" style="s2">of impact on the world and then of</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.319" end="01:03:12.180" style="s2">course everybody kind of has the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.720" end="01:03:14.069" style="s2">klondike dream that you know my my I</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.180" end="01:03:16.349" style="s2">know maybe I&#39;m making a difference I</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.069" end="01:03:17.970" style="s2">mean this this feels a little good</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.349" end="01:03:22.049" style="s2">might as well publish it rather than</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.970" end="01:03:24.299" style="s2">just journal for myself so because then</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.049" end="01:03:27.809" style="s2">I mean I will make the opposite argument</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.299" end="01:03:32.369" style="s2">like the bottom like is not the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.809" end="01:03:34.809" style="s2">production and the bottleneck is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.369" end="01:03:37.799" style="s2">download the cognitive overload</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.809" end="01:03:43.089" style="s2">and not on the kannada overload but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.799" end="01:03:48.339" style="s2">application of knowledge so and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.089" end="01:03:50.589" style="s2">non-arbitrary sorting and evaluating the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.339" end="01:03:54.039" style="s2">right knowledge at the right time at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.589" end="01:03:57.009" style="s2">moment this is an unresolved problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.039" end="01:03:59.829" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s tackled a little bit by the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.009" end="01:04:03.429" style="s2">Google IO race and so on but is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.829" end="01:04:05.169" style="s2">unresolved problem of the informational</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.429" end="01:04:11.859" style="s2">system and coordination system that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.169" end="01:04:15.819" style="s2">have that people people are stuck in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.859" end="01:04:18.099" style="s2">system which feeds us know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.819" end="01:04:19.900" style="s2">opt-in doesn&#39;t effectively optimize that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.099" end="01:04:25.479" style="s2">the right person is the right Knology at</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.900" end="01:04:27.459" style="s2">the right time right so we&#39;re all to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.479" end="01:04:34.259" style="s2">even to the detriment of our mental</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.459" end="01:04:38.349" style="s2">health we are we are over information</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.259" end="01:04:41.469" style="s2">alized and there&#39;s too much content and</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.349" end="01:04:42.849" style="s2">there&#39;s too much and and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.469" end="01:04:44.469" style="s2">download that much and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.849" end="01:04:47.890" style="s2">synthesize that much and we can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.469" end="01:04:50.109" style="s2">that deeply about so much so the major</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.890" end="01:04:53.319" style="s2">challenge then is the complexity</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.109" end="01:04:56.589" style="s2">management of that knowledge creation so</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.319" end="01:04:59.559" style="s2">and so which requires epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.589" end="01:05:03.609" style="s2">communities like I like like we just</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.559" end="01:05:06.219" style="s2">talked about earlier it requires like we</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.609" end="01:05:08.650" style="s2">together like bounding out like an</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.219" end="01:05:10.630" style="s2">alliance and oh we&#39;re gonna help each</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.650" end="01:05:12.579" style="s2">other out we&#39;re gonna you know try to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.630" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">send only was relevant we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.579" end="01:05:17.319" style="s2">to not waste each other&#39;s time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:20.309" style="s2">going to try to like support one other</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.319" end="01:05:23.249" style="s2">in the understanding that things have</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.309" end="01:05:27.699" style="s2">may take longer to reply to and so on</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.249" end="01:05:29.229" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna try to find</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.699" end="01:05:32.109" style="s2">different strengths and weaknesses of</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.229" end="01:05:34.349" style="s2">one another and and leverage those so</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.109" end="01:05:37.650" style="s2">part of it is that like internet</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.349" end="01:05:40.419" style="s2">internet you know clubs or tribes</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.650" end="01:05:42.969" style="s2">showing up men and modern tribes and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.419" end="01:05:47.960" style="s2">another part then and this is a Holy</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.969" end="01:05:50.360" style="s2">Grail really you know is another part is</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.960" end="01:05:53.660" style="s2">the informational architecture so</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.360" end="01:05:56.630" style="s2">somebody out there is working on this</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.660" end="01:06:00.530" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you know working on me I was in</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.630" end="01:06:02.600" style="s2">the IT I was an in-house philosopher out</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.530" end="01:06:04.670" style="s2">of 90 company a while ago and and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.600" end="01:06:07.670" style="s2">were in fact at least in the long run</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.670" end="01:06:11.570" style="s2">trying to tackle this problem that okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.670" end="01:06:15.980" style="s2">we need to revamp the information</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.570" end="01:06:18.860" style="s2">architecture so that the the user</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.980" end="01:06:23.210" style="s2">experience the interface of every person</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.860" end="01:06:25.790" style="s2">is really optimized for their health</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.210" end="01:06:31.820" style="s2">while being an empowerment over the long</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.790" end="01:06:34.450" style="s2">run it last one and this just isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.820" end="01:06:37.160" style="s2">resolved yet so we&#39;re looking at like</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.450" end="01:06:40.010" style="s2">we&#39;re in a very early phase of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.160" end="01:06:42.530" style="s2">internet future internet must be like</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.010" end="01:06:45.860" style="s2">much much much more sensitive the</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.530" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">algorithms we much smarter and so on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.860" end="01:06:54.530" style="s2">last part I wanted to say is that so</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:57.350" style="s2">knowledge creation is no longer is no</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.530" end="01:07:01.220" style="s2">longer like the the sheer production of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.350" end="01:07:04.100" style="s2">new knowledge of ground science is no</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.220" end="01:07:07.070" style="s2">longer actually the viscosity the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.100" end="01:07:12.350" style="s2">scarcity is translation and application</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.070" end="01:07:14.750" style="s2">and transdisciplinarity and and and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.350" end="01:07:16.220" style="s2">use of knowledge in the right place at</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.750" end="01:07:18.500" style="s2">the right time if everybody could</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.220" end="01:07:22.790" style="s2">actually just download all the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.500" end="01:07:24.770" style="s2">in the world then we would probably have</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.790" end="01:07:26.660" style="s2">all enough knowledge to resolve all of</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.770" end="01:07:28.310" style="s2">our problems but we can&#39;t the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.660" end="01:07:29.990" style="s2">knowledge is and at the right time isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.310" end="01:07:34.070" style="s2">at the right place at the right time so</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.990" end="01:07:37.250" style="s2">there is a whole class of people this</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.070" end="01:07:39.890" style="s2">big percentage of the population will in</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.250" end="01:07:44.350" style="s2">the new labor market start you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.890" end="01:07:46.070" style="s2">being connectors of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.350" end="01:07:49.070" style="s2">translators of knowledge between</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.070" end="01:07:53.180" style="s2">different fields and this is like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.070" end="01:07:55.340" style="s2">major and it&#39;s and we can be helped by</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.180" end="01:07:57.770" style="s2">algorithm&#39;s to be done by human beings</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.340" end="01:08:00.670" style="s2">probably for a long time to come</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.770" end="01:08:07.220" style="s2">and this application is creativity this</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.670" end="01:08:08.780" style="s2">this yeah so so and and that connects of</p>
