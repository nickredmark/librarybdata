<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">five minutes to answer the question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">then we have an open conversation for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">the remainder of the time so whoever</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">would like to start is welcome I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">wants to jump it all right Erica go and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:33.480" style="s2">then I&#39;d everyone else can just mute</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:35.430" style="s2">themselves I mean assuming nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.480" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">wants to but I&#39;m quite happy to kick</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.430" end="00:00:38.670" style="s2">things off yeah I mean I there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:41.700" style="s2">couple of things that occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.670" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">with this question firstly it really</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.700" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">needs to be seen in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">overall scheme right and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.739" style="s2">potentially misleading doing each of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">these cafes on a different question I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.739" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">mean I get it because it gives us time</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">to explore each question in more depth I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">get that but it also is a bit possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">to forget the fact that it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">larger thing right and they can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">look at any one of them in isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">so you know who are my people I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:11.580" style="s2">for some people that could be quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">triggering what do you mean who my</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.580" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">people that sounds you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">racist bigoted exclusive whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:20.610" style="s2">kind of thing you know that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">exclusionary and it&#39;s not in that spirit</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">at all the who are my people is who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">the kinds of people that I can really</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">get stuck into stuff with you know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">I mean people that I can really explore</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:36.900" style="s2">ideas with people that I can rely on</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">people that I trust people that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.900" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">capable in the areas that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">need each other to be capable that kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">of thing so you know it&#39;s not about I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">like these people but I don&#39;t like these</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">people it&#39;s not about that at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:51.689" style="s2">about who are those special people how</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">do I go about find them those ones who</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.689" end="00:01:57.450" style="s2">are going to enable me to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.130" style="s2">other questions more fully right and so</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">things that I need to fulfill my purpose</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">they by being another pair of eyes</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">looking at me other pair of eyes that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">trust I see myself in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">cannot see myself through the eyes of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:21.090" style="s2">people you&#39;re not I mean and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah those are the two</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.090" end="00:02:24.360" style="s2">things I really wanted to kick off with</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:26.460" style="s2">was number one don&#39;t look at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.360" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">question in isolation it&#39;s absolutely an</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.460" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">integral part of the overall scheme and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">be that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">yeah it should absolutely not be viewed</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:37.950" style="s2">in any kind of negative way as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">phrasing of the question could elicit in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.950" end="00:02:46.940" style="s2">some people right invite you to answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">the question who are your people like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.940" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">specific people in my or do you mean in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:53.160" style="s2">a sort of general sense what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">people do I consider my people anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.160" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">one answer a bit like for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">instead of about the question right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:01.830" style="s2">whether in the past where you have felt</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">you belong present or in the future if</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.830" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">you haven&#39;t experienced that where would</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:07.020" style="s2">you like to find yourself in community</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.990" end="00:03:17.580" style="s2">what that is the point right is and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:19.020" style="s2">find that a really difficult question to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.580" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">answer because it&#39;s a different answer</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.020" end="00:03:25.050" style="s2">in different moments right and so I mean</p>

<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.620" style="s2">ideas for the sake of exploring ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.970" end="00:03:39.990" style="s2">because it&#39;s interesting and it enriches</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.650" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">cuz watching Matt talk like I realized</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.539" end="00:08:15.500" style="s2">that this is the first time I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:19.940" style="s2">Matt but Matt and I have like emailed a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.500" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">few times and then like it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.940" end="00:08:22.729" style="s2">because you&#39;d normally these</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:26.030" style="s2">conversations are kind of just game be</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.729" end="00:08:27.530" style="s2">people and now it&#39;s not right like now I</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.030" end="00:08:29.270" style="s2">don&#39;t think Matt found me through game B</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.530" end="00:08:30.770" style="s2">I think that was just through social</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.270" end="00:08:32.570" style="s2">media right through Twitter and YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.770" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">I don&#39;t think he&#39;s associated with game</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.570" end="00:08:35.659" style="s2">B at least at the moment and Eric I</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:37.099" style="s2">found through game B and Shiloh also you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.659" end="00:08:40.190" style="s2">found me and then put me in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.099" end="00:08:42.260" style="s2">the radish people like it&#39;s I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.190" end="00:08:44.990" style="s2">I&#39;m like the more I put myself myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.260" end="00:08:46.580" style="s2">out there to the world who is my people</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.990" end="00:08:48.380" style="s2">but also then you find people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.580" end="00:08:50.420" style="s2">like really your people I could people</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.380" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">who are the ones who want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.420" end="00:08:57.110" style="s2">same conversations and you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:09:00.620" style="s2">any one group or one person to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.110" end="00:09:02.180" style="s2">everything that you can find like I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.620" end="00:09:03.860" style="s2">talk about geek culture with some people</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.180" end="00:09:05.630" style="s2">and I can talk about you know food and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.860" end="00:09:07.070" style="s2">agriculture with some people this with</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.630" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">other people and then there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.070" end="00:09:11.089" style="s2">are report about the systems and can</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:12.589" style="s2">talk about anything and I&#39;m just and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.089" end="00:09:14.390" style="s2">what I forgot to mention during my five</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.589" end="00:09:16.520" style="s2">minutes where I was like oops who has uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.390" end="00:09:19.850" style="s2">autistic people on my people when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.520" end="00:09:24.110" style="s2">figured that out last spring and then in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.850" end="00:09:26.540" style="s2">those communities I&#39;m like oh I&#39;m along</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.110" end="00:09:28.580" style="s2">here and people letter that are autistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.540" end="00:09:30.020" style="s2">belong with me as well and like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.580" end="00:09:32.510" style="s2">quirks and everything I didn&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.020" end="00:09:34.190" style="s2">about myself my whole life I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.510" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what makes me me and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.190" end="00:09:37.550" style="s2">I&#39;m here to do and so does everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:41.980" style="s2">and a lot of it is like the quirks that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.550" end="00:09:45.260" style="s2">make you less palatable to the masses</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.980" end="00:09:47.750" style="s2">give you your like magic to be your true</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.260" end="00:09:50.060" style="s2">self and offer what your purpose more</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.750" end="00:09:52.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the more not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.060" end="00:09:54.680" style="s2">these questions in isolation the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.670" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">you&#39;re able to find your people or your</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.680" end="00:09:57.860" style="s2">purpose you find your people you find</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">yourself you find what you need and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.860" end="00:10:01.010" style="s2">know what you have to let go of and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">is why we&#39;re doing these five questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.010" end="00:10:05.330" style="s2">but yes I will not talk about them this</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:06.709" style="s2">is a conversation not a you had an 8:30</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.330" end="00:10:10.310" style="s2">in the morning me preaching for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.709" end="00:10:12.589" style="s2">so something that occurred to me while</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.310" end="00:10:14.899" style="s2">Matt was talking is he said at the end</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.589" end="00:10:17.329" style="s2">my people at those who</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.899" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">want to do good or something along those</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.329" end="00:10:22.339" style="s2">lines anyway and I think this is in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.050" style="s2">way what distinguishes your people from</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.339" end="00:10:25.639" style="s2">those who are not your people is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.050" end="00:10:27.619" style="s2">your definition of things which are good</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.639" end="00:10:32.209" style="s2">right you know not everybody thinks the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.619" end="00:10:33.679" style="s2">same things are good so yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.209" end="00:10:34.879" style="s2">know there are people who are not your</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.679" end="00:10:36.259" style="s2">people that doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.879" end="00:10:38.209" style="s2">against them you know what I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.259" end="00:10:40.759" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s any antipathy</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.209" end="00:10:42.499" style="s2">necessary but there&#39;s just you know how</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.759" end="00:10:44.089" style="s2">it is some people you meet them you just</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.499" end="00:10:45.439" style="s2">you just on a wavelength right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.089" end="00:10:47.149" style="s2">need to explain to each other you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.439" end="00:10:49.759" style="s2">just get it you know and and other</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.149" end="00:10:51.319" style="s2">people it&#39;s not like that and and so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.759" end="00:10:55.129" style="s2">know there are people who are more your</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.319" end="00:10:57.949" style="s2">people than other people but and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.129" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">I guess the danger of which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.949" end="00:11:01.879" style="s2">what I alluded to it to start the danger</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.949" style="s2">of who are my people is in-group</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.879" end="00:11:06.559" style="s2">out-group in it right and starting to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.949" end="00:11:08.029" style="s2">assign characteristics to those who you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.559" end="00:11:10.429" style="s2">know unfavorable characteristics to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.029" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">those who are not my people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.429" end="00:11:14.569" style="s2">my people are special because that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:16.730" style="s2">of thing and so I think this is the this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.569" end="00:11:18.949" style="s2">is maybe a trap that people fall into I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.730" end="00:11:25.850" style="s2">think it&#39;s worth highlighting that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.949" end="00:11:27.410" style="s2">danger maybe I have to say for me when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:30.170" style="s2">think of this question is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.410" end="00:11:32.420" style="s2">question it&#39;s kind of a deeper dive not</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.170" end="00:11:35.629" style="s2">necessarily excluding people but really</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.420" end="00:11:38.329" style="s2">like who are the people that I need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.629" end="00:11:40.309" style="s2">help fulfill my purpose and the greater</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.329" end="00:11:43.610" style="s2">world out there is you know still there</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.309" end="00:11:46.309" style="s2">and I&#39;m very inclusive like I say but at</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.610" end="00:11:48.819" style="s2">the same time I do need like a Nicolas</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.309" end="00:11:51.740" style="s2">of people that I can actually be very</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.819" end="00:11:53.990" style="s2">purpose filled or purpose centric I</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.740" end="00:11:57.559" style="s2">guess where I can&#39;t even with my family</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.990" end="00:11:59.299" style="s2">or my other close friends they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.559" end="00:12:01.459" style="s2">sick of me talking about saving the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.299" end="00:12:05.949" style="s2">world looks like I need to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.459" end="00:12:05.949" style="s2">and I cannot waste any more time with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.220" end="00:12:08.870" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.490" end="00:12:12.769" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;re my people to try</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.870" end="00:12:14.540" style="s2">them we need each other so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.769" end="00:12:16.309" style="s2">not like burn our bridges with other</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.540" end="00:12:20.600" style="s2">people that we love that we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.309" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">to stop being around but yeah it can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.600" end="00:12:26.089" style="s2">very wearing on people and that like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:28.610" style="s2">don&#39;t want to part of who are my people</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.089" end="00:12:32.149" style="s2">are also</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.610" end="00:12:34.100" style="s2">who aren&#39;t my people and not in because</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:16.250" style="s2">mutually beneficial relationship we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.360" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">each other&#39;s people on one level it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.250" end="00:14:19.399" style="s2">pretty practical level rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:22.940" style="s2">sort of personal friendship level but</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.399" end="00:14:25.130" style="s2">nevertheless you know we we fulfill a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.940" end="00:14:26.870" style="s2">positive function in each other&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.130" end="00:14:28.940" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s on a lot of levels isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.870" end="00:14:30.820" style="s2">who are my people simultaneously of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.940" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">different people on different levels you</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.370" end="00:14:46.760" style="s2">feel most comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.140" end="00:14:52.030" style="s2">and then sometimes I find that I find my</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.760" end="00:14:55.670" style="s2">people and then that changes and so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.030" end="00:14:59.150" style="s2">feel like my people are the people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.670" end="00:15:01.550" style="s2">I&#39;m with at the time that I&#39;m with does</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.020" end="00:16:13.910" style="s2">preconceived notions that you had</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.830" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">dissolve and they become your people so</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.910" end="00:16:23.450" style="s2">I think what we&#39;re talking about is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:25.010" style="s2">very slippery thing yeah it is it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.450" end="00:16:26.390" style="s2">none of these questions or questions you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.010" end="00:16:28.790" style="s2">can actually answer and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.390" end="00:16:30.200" style="s2">done they&#39;re constantly or like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.790" end="00:16:33.470" style="s2">don&#39;t answer who are my people then it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:33.470" end="00:16:36.980" style="s2">family becomes not your people even if</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.910" end="00:16:38.030" style="s2">they are your people and new people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.980" end="00:16:40.340" style="s2">like what you said about that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.030" end="00:16:43.430" style="s2">changes I have found maybe less so now</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.340" end="00:16:45.710" style="s2">that I&#39;m 40 but for a lot of my 20s and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.430" end="00:16:47.420" style="s2">even teen years I had this pattern where</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.710" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">if I would ask people after they met me</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.420" end="00:16:52.850" style="s2">for a period of time what they thought</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:54.200" style="s2">of me I grate on people&#39;s nerves in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.850" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">beginning and then they really loved me</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.200" end="00:16:57.650" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">like I cuz it&#39;s like once you passed</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.650" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">that point I&#39;m people&#39;s favorite but</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:03.200" style="s2">like you have to get past that point and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:05.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m not gonna be to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.200" end="00:17:06.470" style="s2">different in the beginning means you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.030" end="00:17:08.060" style="s2">don&#39;t get to get to that anyway like</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.060" end="00:17:12.199" style="s2">knowing pre like this would be really</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.620" end="00:17:14.870" style="s2">trying to fit in and really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.199" end="00:17:16.459" style="s2">like be the person in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.870" end="00:17:20.329" style="s2">still I&#39;m like yeah I can annoy you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.459" end="00:17:21.949" style="s2">I am loud and talk a lot and some</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.329" end="00:17:26.390" style="s2">people&#39;s cup of tea and not others and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.949" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">it is that no mean that it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.390" end="00:17:31.460" style="s2">turn people off it&#39;s okay for people not</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.630" style="s2">to be your people and that is hard it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.460" end="00:17:34.190" style="s2">like as a people like when you&#39;re people</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.630" end="00:17:36.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like I want everyone to like me</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.190" end="00:17:38.180" style="s2">well then you have to be vanilla right</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.560" end="00:17:39.740" style="s2">you have to be more palatable to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.180" end="00:17:42.710" style="s2">everyone and really then no one likes</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.740" end="00:17:49.340" style="s2">you it&#39;s just you&#39;re acceptable to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.710" end="00:17:51.110" style="s2">everyone and boring yeah and something</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.340" end="00:17:52.550" style="s2">that matt said where he&#39;s like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.110" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">really be in your mind checking off</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.550" end="00:17:58.760" style="s2">these box moves but I do even like now I</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:02.330" style="s2">find people I meet I&#39;ve met people they</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.760" end="00:18:03.980" style="s2">seem like they&#39;re my people like Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.330" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.980" end="00:18:08.840" style="s2">her and then for three days after that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:11.690" style="s2">I&#39;ll just stressed out that I said all</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.840" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">the wrong stuff I sounded like a fool I</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.690" end="00:18:16.430" style="s2">might have like she&#39;s like oh I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:19.190" style="s2">deal with this person so I&#39;m glad to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.430" end="00:18:20.660" style="s2">hear that you also maybe annoy people in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.190" end="00:18:23.000" style="s2">the beginning I hope you guys can get</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.660" end="00:18:24.680" style="s2">past that but it is a weird thing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:26.090" style="s2">meet new people and I was like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.680" end="00:18:29.330" style="s2">want to screw this up I might have just</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.090" end="00:18:31.220" style="s2">screwed it up didn&#39;t scruff anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.330" end="00:18:33.050" style="s2">literally I don&#39;t think anyone does</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.220" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the point of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.050" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">being my people but when Matt said that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:39.140" style="s2">I actually was like oh I absolutely do</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:40.850" style="s2">that with partners in both ways right</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.140" end="00:18:43.040" style="s2">where I&#39;m like you have to check these</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.850" end="00:18:45.980" style="s2">boxes because you&#39;re the like exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.040" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">person in my life and I need to check</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:51.410" style="s2">that&#39;s broken in a whole other way but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.850" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">don&#39;t feel that way with everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.410" end="00:18:55.490" style="s2">because you don&#39;t need to be everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:57.260" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to be my entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.490" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">and my source of emotional support like</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.260" end="00:19:01.430" style="s2">which one of those things do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">be right and that&#39;s the only the only</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.430" end="00:19:07.040" style="s2">piece and this is part of why I&#39;m single</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like I got the the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.040" end="00:19:10.850" style="s2">when I went I did I</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:12.530" style="s2">two years ago and what I got through it</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.850" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">I got very little through it besides</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.530" end="00:19:16.820" style="s2">knowing that that was my next step of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2">journey was that community is my</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.820" end="00:19:20.179" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s where I it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:21.620" style="s2">people get out of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.179" end="00:19:23.510" style="s2">one-on-one is what I get out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.620" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">community it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s my growth</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.510" end="00:19:27.830" style="s2">it&#39;s my support it&#39;s all of that but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:29.240" style="s2">need it at a community level which means</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.830" end="00:19:31.040" style="s2">there&#39;s then less pressure on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.240" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">individual level anyway if I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.040" end="00:19:35.270" style="s2">relationship but it was like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:37.100" style="s2">what I&#39;m here to do not this this</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.270" end="00:19:40.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t both is scary and doesn&#39;t appeal</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.100" end="00:19:43.190" style="s2">to me in the same way this does so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.540" end="00:19:45.169" style="s2">love that you said that when we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.190" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">community you&#39;re right our other</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.169" end="00:19:50.510" style="s2">individual relationships aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:52.429" style="s2">important so it just makes it lighter</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.510" end="00:19:55.250" style="s2">for everybody to get along the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.429" end="00:19:59.480" style="s2">community I have very little so I could</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.250" end="00:20:02.650" style="s2">really use yeah if I could just moderate</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.480" end="00:20:04.580" style="s2">the phrasing on that slightly because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.650" end="00:20:06.679" style="s2">resonate a lot with what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.580" end="00:20:09.320" style="s2">before Shiloh because I get that myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.679" end="00:20:11.210" style="s2">with people that I look up to right</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.320" end="00:20:14.780" style="s2">people that I put on some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.210" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">pedestal then it&#39;s like do they like me</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.780" end="00:20:18.200" style="s2">did I say the wrong thing oh my god did</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">I sound like an idiot doing that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.200" end="00:20:23.150" style="s2">kind of thing and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a giving</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:26.590" style="s2">your power to the other person right not</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.150" end="00:20:29.630" style="s2">even to the other person but to your</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.590" end="00:20:30.470" style="s2">fantasy creation of the other person</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.630" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">because you don&#39;t even know them that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.470" end="00:20:34.309" style="s2">well yeah right and so actually what</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:35.809" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is giving your power to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.309" end="00:20:39.620" style="s2">fantasy that you&#39;ve created in your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.809" end="00:20:43.040" style="s2">mind and yeah as I say I identify</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.620" end="00:20:44.660" style="s2">because I do it myself I&#39;ve got a cousin</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.040" end="00:20:46.179" style="s2">who lives in Singapore yeah I&#39;ve known</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.190" end="00:21:06.140" style="s2">know I&#39;ve never lost that that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.760" end="00:21:08.840" style="s2">you know what I mean that I had for him</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.140" end="00:21:10.760" style="s2">when I was a kid this this this you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.840" end="00:21:13.820" style="s2">enormous admiration and respect or</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.760" end="00:21:15.350" style="s2">whatever and so yeah I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.820" end="00:21:19.460" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re talking about but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.350" end="00:21:21.799" style="s2">is it is a sacrificing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.460" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">disempowering thing right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.799" end="00:21:34.580" style="s2">I try to tell myself but these people</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">that like your cousin or Jubilee who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.580" end="00:21:37.999" style="s2">important like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:40.909" style="s2">these people that are important to us so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.999" end="00:21:43.369" style="s2">I guess making mistakes with them is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.909" end="00:21:45.619" style="s2">best place to make Ramakant fell in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.369" end="00:21:47.929" style="s2">definitely a learning lesson I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.619" end="00:21:51.980" style="s2">I&#39;m growing every time I just don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.929" end="00:21:53.299" style="s2">to ruin anything to keep growing and if</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.980" end="00:21:54.499" style="s2">they are the kind of person that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.299" end="00:21:56.090" style="s2">think they are like you&#39;ve identified</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.499" end="00:21:57.619" style="s2">with them as your people if they are</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.090" end="00:22:00.109" style="s2">that kind of person then if you do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.619" end="00:22:02.330" style="s2">say something stupid so what we all say</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.109" end="00:22:05.929" style="s2">stupid stuff sometimes right and and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.330" end="00:22:07.580" style="s2">know that&#39;s yeah it&#39;s interesting to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.929" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">describe your cousin right that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.580" end="00:22:11.119" style="s2">like five years older than you looked up</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:12.470" style="s2">to him that is very much my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.119" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">with my sister she&#39;s two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.470" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">years older than me and looked up and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:18.499" style="s2">had a falling out a year and a bit ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:19.999" style="s2">because and which was absolutely needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.499" end="00:22:22.279" style="s2">like I need you not to be on a pedestal</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.999" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">this has to be equal or not at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.279" end="00:22:26.299" style="s2">because it&#39;s costing me something having</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.440" end="00:22:27.859" style="s2">you there and saying the wrong thing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.299" end="00:22:29.989" style="s2">needing to show up in a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.859" end="00:22:32.389" style="s2">feeling like you don&#39;t accept me for who</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.989" end="00:22:34.429" style="s2">I am and how I should like all of it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.389" end="00:22:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.429" end="00:22:39.080" style="s2">needed and partly I had to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.460" end="00:22:41.029" style="s2">let it go a hundred percent like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.080" end="00:22:44.359" style="s2">never in my life again in order and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.029" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">knowing full well that in order to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.359" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">was the only way to have her in my life</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:50.600" style="s2">at any point in the future was to let it</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:52.489" style="s2">go completely what it was so it could</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.600" end="00:22:55.100" style="s2">rebuild what it what it will be in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.489" end="00:22:56.809" style="s2">future and it&#39;s an exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.100" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">relationship I only have one sister</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.809" end="00:23:00.619" style="s2">there is no because that was part of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.210" end="00:23:03.019" style="s2">it&#39;s like when I look up to someone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.619" end="00:23:05.090" style="s2">like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.019" end="00:23:06.769" style="s2">urgency right like no one else could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.090" end="00:23:09.710" style="s2">Jordan Hall so what you know like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.769" end="00:23:11.869" style="s2">kind of but that&#39;s true for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.710" end="00:23:13.940" style="s2">right like no one else can be Shilo no</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.869" end="00:23:16.009" style="s2">one else can be Eric and so I&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.940" end="00:23:17.720" style="s2">that exclusiveness even with like people</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.009" end="00:23:20.149" style="s2">I do look up to and I&#39;m talking to them</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.720" end="00:23:22.220" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m like it&#39;s actually not exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.149" end="00:23:23.629" style="s2">everyone&#39;s intelligent everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.220" end="00:23:25.519" style="s2">something to give and so there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.629" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">than enough out there but there honestly</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.519" end="00:23:30.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t more than enough sisters out there</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:31.580" style="s2">like I don&#39;t we have one but then all</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.200" end="00:23:34.220" style="s2">these other relationships are like</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.580" end="00:23:36.889" style="s2">actually I have amazing relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.220" end="00:23:39.500" style="s2">the do treat me right but do see me for</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.889" end="00:23:41.419" style="s2">me and accept me and therefore once we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.500" end="00:23:43.700" style="s2">get back together I&#39;ll be more willing</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.419" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">to it&#39;s not that relationship piece of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.700" end="00:23:45.830" style="s2">right you have to check off all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">boxes because you&#39;re my one and only</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.830" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">sister and I&#39;m just getting that now</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.289" end="00:23:57.169" style="s2">it&#39;s funny you can&#39;t deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.490" end="00:23:59.059" style="s2">stuff on the propositional level you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.169" end="00:24:01.700" style="s2">know I mean I I know and have known for</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.059" end="00:24:06.649" style="s2">many years that exactly what Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.700" end="00:24:08.659" style="s2">said right you know but you know this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.649" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">this feeling has been with me a long</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.659" end="00:24:12.080" style="s2">time you know I mean you can&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:13.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t just it doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.080" end="00:24:16.279" style="s2">go well I&#39;m not sure you ever really get</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.700" end="00:24:18.610" style="s2">rid of it it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s funny soft</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.610" end="00:24:26.210" style="s2">still drives you in spite of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.710" end="00:24:27.409" style="s2">that you know about it yeah cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.210" end="00:24:28.909" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t just be like well then I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.409" end="00:24:30.139" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t hold them on a pedestal I</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.139" end="00:24:36.049" style="s2">boxes and that is the irony I know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.639" end="00:24:37.220" style="s2">had this conversation that just went</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.049" end="00:24:40.879" style="s2">through the whole story on my Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.220" end="00:24:42.500" style="s2">story but like I asked my sister to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.879" end="00:24:45.049" style="s2">kind to me because she means so much to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.500" end="00:24:47.240" style="s2">me and I can&#39;t handle stress and she did</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.049" end="00:24:49.519" style="s2">the exact opposite and sent me this like</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.240" end="00:24:51.769" style="s2">really what I mean like it&#39;s but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.519" end="00:24:53.299" style="s2">meaning email I was like I need kindness</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.769" end="00:24:54.710" style="s2">and she sent me the opposite and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.299" end="00:24:55.879" style="s2">like it was perfect because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.710" end="00:24:58.429" style="s2">only thing that would knock her down</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.879" end="00:25:00.259" style="s2">from the pedestal of like oh you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.429" end="00:25:01.669" style="s2">see me you&#39;re never gonna see me I need</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.259" end="00:25:03.139" style="s2">you to accept me for me but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.669" end="00:25:05.389" style="s2">accepting you for who you are that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.139" end="00:25:07.759" style="s2">can&#39;t accept me for me and like even</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.389" end="00:25:09.799" style="s2">knowing that I needed whenever the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.759" end="00:25:12.409" style="s2">participatory right I needed a year to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.799" end="00:25:15.259" style="s2">like feel the anger work through the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.409" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2">hatred of whatever level and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.259" end="00:25:18.409" style="s2">more back to neutral and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:20.539" style="s2">certain morning of like I&#39;m never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.409" end="00:25:22.370" style="s2">be back to that place of pedestal and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.539" end="00:25:24.230" style="s2">that relationship and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.370" end="00:25:26.570" style="s2">you won&#39;t that&#39;s never gonna happen but</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.230" end="00:25:35.419" style="s2">like we can maybe create something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.570" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">is more this is not many things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.419" end="00:25:44.200" style="s2">people can do worse than fails to live</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:44.200" style="s2">up to your expectations of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.239" end="00:25:51.119" style="s2">and I think that kind of brings us back</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.619" end="00:25:54.369" style="s2">to your people because in just my like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.119" end="00:25:56.469" style="s2">description of my people being like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.369" end="00:25:58.210" style="s2">nucleolus or whatever I guess finding</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.469" end="00:26:02.229" style="s2">those people helps you fulfill yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.210" end="00:26:04.149" style="s2">more and strengthen your own beliefs or</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.229" end="00:26:05.769" style="s2">whatnot so that when you do go back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.149" end="00:26:07.809" style="s2">those people that you maybe put on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.769" end="00:26:09.999" style="s2">pedestal or whatever you feel more equal</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.809" end="00:26:12.759" style="s2">because you can&#39;t work up your own inner</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.999" end="00:26:14.169" style="s2">self and therefore it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.759" end="00:26:16.539" style="s2">relationship like you&#39;re saying you let</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.169" end="00:26:19.479" style="s2">it go so you can have a new one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.539" end="00:26:30.700" style="s2">cool to realize we are all helping each</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.479" end="00:26:32.409" style="s2">other get better yeah that&#39;s the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.700" end="00:26:35.489" style="s2">right but you&#39;ve got to be brutal if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.409" end="00:26:38.349" style="s2">if there&#39;s people in your life who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.489" end="00:26:39.789" style="s2">you know holding you back like almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.349" end="00:26:41.830" style="s2">deliberately whether they&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.789" end="00:26:43.509" style="s2">eat anybody art but you know of it I</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.830" end="00:26:44.979" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think there are times to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.509" end="00:26:47.320" style="s2">brutal and just cut them out right</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.979" end="00:26:49.869" style="s2">because you know I mean an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.320" end="00:26:51.549" style="s2">example would be say that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.869" end="00:26:52.929" style="s2">you and your girlfriend used to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.549" end="00:26:54.879" style="s2">heroin addicts and you get cleaned</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.929" end="00:26:58.089" style="s2">together and then she falls back into it</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.879" end="00:27:00.429" style="s2">but you watch Jeremy not you you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.089" end="00:27:02.109" style="s2">you love her but that I&#39;d you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.429" end="00:27:04.539" style="s2">I&#39;ve just got out of this you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.109" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">what&#39;s more important my sobriety or my</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.539" end="00:27:08.289" style="s2">love for you and you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:09.849" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard call to make but I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.289" end="00:27:11.799" style="s2">absolutely sympathize with cutting that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.849" end="00:27:18.940" style="s2"> out of your life for your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.799" end="00:27:21.099" style="s2">long-term you know well-being then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.940" end="00:27:24.580" style="s2">find new people probably at an a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.099" end="00:27:26.889" style="s2">or whatever gotta get a new group of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.580" end="00:27:31.389" style="s2">people then so that you can pour your</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.889" end="00:27:35.099" style="s2">sobriety yeah but just also for me part</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.389" end="00:27:36.849" style="s2">of my incentive to create the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.099" end="00:27:39.129" style="s2">infrastructure for people to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.849" end="00:27:40.450" style="s2">easily find their people is that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.129" end="00:27:42.940" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to hold on to their</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.450" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">people as strongly and which means you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.940" end="00:27:46.629" style="s2">also can choose where you&#39;re holding on</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:48.369" style="s2">to your people right like if you know if</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.580" end="00:28:12.760" style="s2">contingent on this and it&#39;s like how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.020" end="00:28:14.650" style="s2">you find that next group so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.760" end="00:28:17.530" style="s2">permit if you&#39;ve just jumping from group</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.050" end="00:28:28.390" style="s2">but the more people are able to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.310" end="00:28:30.160" style="s2">some finds connection and community and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.390" end="00:28:31.450" style="s2">their people the more they&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.160" end="00:28:32.830" style="s2">show up in the communities they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.450" end="00:28:34.990" style="s2">because they know they could leave right</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.830" end="00:28:36.310" style="s2">and you&#39;re I don&#39;t want it to be that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.990" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">you&#39;re more likely to kick people out</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.310" end="00:28:39.970" style="s2">but you&#39;re also more more able to say</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.940" end="00:29:03.250" style="s2">sometimes talk sickness is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:04.690" style="s2">you need to go through either in getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.250" end="00:29:07.060" style="s2">them to really be part of the group and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.690" end="00:29:09.100" style="s2">then your more cohesive or cohesiveness</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.010" end="00:29:15.130" style="s2">able to do more of those things because</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.450" end="00:29:17.500" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not setting them out to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.130" end="00:29:19.630" style="s2">die in the desert you&#39;re saying you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:45.610" style="s2">because otherwise it&#39;s coercive right at</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.170" end="00:29:48.690" style="s2">some level rather it&#39;s coercive if you</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.220" end="00:44:01.360" style="s2">would say following what ever feels</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.070" style="s2">right for you in the moment like</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.730" end="00:45:43.600" style="s2">life and what I had done how do I find</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.700" end="00:46:01.390" style="s2">found the cohousing community because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.950" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">was rather obsessed with that for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.390" end="00:46:06.010" style="s2">or online communities are really easy</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:07.750" style="s2">because you can focus it much more you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.010" end="00:46:09.310" style="s2">know like I have so many health</p>

<p begin="00:46:25.869" end="00:46:31.270" style="s2">but I also really want the tools for</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.460" end="00:46:57.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the conversation that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.109" end="00:47:00.970" style="s2">idea cafe was like oh we can connect</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.820" end="00:47:02.890" style="s2">around a topic and that is still</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.970" end="00:47:06.280" style="s2">something that social media has yet to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.890" end="00:47:08.850" style="s2">kind of focus on is like video chat it</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.280" end="00:47:11.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t weird and awkward that like isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.840" end="00:47:24.520" style="s2">space because most people want to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.160" end="00:47:26.290" style="s2">real conversation yet every conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.520" end="00:47:27.910" style="s2">we have in society isn&#39;t that real right</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.290" end="00:47:29.290" style="s2">it is just like the small talk on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.910" end="00:47:31.810" style="s2">bus but when you&#39;re in it when you</p>

<p begin="00:47:35.770" end="00:47:40.840" style="s2">conversation of someone at a bus stop or</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.210" end="00:47:42.460" style="s2">on the bus and it&#39;s when I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.840" end="00:47:43.930" style="s2">right space when I&#39;m ready to connect</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.230" end="00:47:56.140" style="s2">bring us together like Facebook is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.730" end="00:47:57.730" style="s2">great place to meet people but then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.140" end="00:47:59.320" style="s2">owned by Zuckerberg it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.730" end="00:48:02.590" style="s2">designed to bring you people or it would</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.320" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">be more helpful in finding what groups</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.590" end="00:48:05.800" style="s2">would resonate with you and said you</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.220" end="00:48:25.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot easier to understand than</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.110" end="00:53:13.410" style="s2">six months like you do with dating apps</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:15.180" style="s2">like they can just make more friends</p>

<p begin="00:53:19.380" end="00:53:22.920" style="s2">friendship app or whether it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:28.280" style="s2">something to the side that like sneaks</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.920" end="00:53:28.280" style="s2">in friendship like a conversation up</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.270" end="00:53:37.820" style="s2">sorry Matt you go ahead you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.700" end="00:53:40.440" style="s2">all these you know Silicon Valley</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.080" end="00:53:46.770" style="s2">that and then you hear about you hear</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.670" end="00:53:48.420" style="s2">about some couple that met playing World</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.770" end="00:53:49.980" style="s2">of Warcraft and they&#39;re married for</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.420" end="00:53:52.170" style="s2">thirty years or something you know so</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.980" end="00:53:57.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like did we even meet that you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.170" end="00:53:59.790" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know anyway there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.480" end="00:54:01.020" style="s2">market incentive for dating apps or</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.790" end="00:54:02.310" style="s2">friendship apps or whatever to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.020" end="00:54:04.020" style="s2">successful because if they&#39;re successful</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.310" end="00:54:05.580" style="s2">then you don&#39;t come back and use them</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.020" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">again right and your subscription lasts</p>

<p begin="00:54:09.420" end="00:54:13.410" style="s2">market incentive for them to provide</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.460" end="00:54:15.600" style="s2">shitty services that don&#39;t work so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.410" end="00:54:18.750" style="s2">keep paying for them for the dating apps</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.600" end="00:54:20.550" style="s2">yes absolutely they need enough marriage</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.750" end="00:54:22.440" style="s2">is to put the picture on the site and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.550" end="00:54:23.940" style="s2">then enough and most of them need to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.440" end="00:54:26.250" style="s2">broken so they&#39;re just likely and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.940" end="00:54:28.590" style="s2">through but our dating app our</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.250" end="00:54:30.990" style="s2">friendship at the point of it is purpose</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.590" end="00:54:33.840" style="s2">and not the profit there&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.990" end="00:54:35.700" style="s2">ways but I had like 20 ideas for dating</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.279" end="00:56:08.039" style="s2">about finding where you&#39;re compatible</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.329" end="00:56:10.529" style="s2">right it&#39;s so like maybe you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.039" end="00:56:11.880" style="s2">someone or something they can change but</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.529" end="00:56:13.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not about you getting feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.880" end="00:56:16.020" style="s2">like oh sit up straighter don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.740" end="00:56:18.539" style="s2">about yourself do this it&#39;s about even</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.020" end="00:56:22.549" style="s2">if you slouch and talk about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.539" end="00:56:22.549" style="s2">all the time this person digs that right</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.490" end="00:56:29.880" style="s2">it was a side-to-side track there&#39;s ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.170" end="00:56:31.589" style="s2">that we can create dating apps and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.880" end="00:56:35.549" style="s2">also friendship apps of course that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.589" end="00:56:37.740" style="s2">much more focus on dating and friendship</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.549" end="00:56:39.150" style="s2">apps about finding your people so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.740" end="00:56:41.579" style="s2">not really a side check tool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.150" end="00:56:43.260" style="s2">actually pretty much on topic it is true</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.579" end="00:56:46.789" style="s2">it&#39;s more on topic than Tao stack but</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.260" end="00:56:49.500" style="s2">like everything comes back to technology</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.789" end="00:56:51.539" style="s2">- tech I&#39;ve just been looking at one big</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.500" end="00:56:52.740" style="s2">difference I think I see I don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.539" end="00:56:54.029" style="s2">I haven&#39;t read everything about dowel</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.740" end="00:56:57.270" style="s2">stay but I&#39;ve just been glancing through</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.029" end="00:56:58.770" style="s2">I see no mention of a currency as being</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.270" end="00:57:00.150" style="s2">part of down state whereas holo does</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.770" end="00:57:02.099" style="s2">have a currency as part of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.150" end="00:57:06.140" style="s2">so is that right is there no currency</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.099" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">involved in they&#39;ll stick a dowel stack</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.140" end="00:57:16.829" style="s2">has a token there is a token right okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">okay yeah it&#39;s I think it&#39;s D D and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.829" end="00:57:22.760" style="s2">Genesis is it which is mined or is it a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:25.920" style="s2">token which is gained through being</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.760" end="00:57:28.470" style="s2">participating in the network I well you</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.920" end="00:57:29.850" style="s2">can buy it and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.470" end="00:57:32.670" style="s2">gained by participate</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.850" end="00:57:35.430" style="s2">in the network as well okay so not just</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.670" end="00:57:38.220" style="s2">by anonymous mining ecologist I have</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.430" end="00:57:41.850" style="s2"> running there right okay yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.220" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think yeah I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.850" end="00:57:47.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a minor bull minor bug okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:50.340" style="s2">and and I think I think I&#39;m not to</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.610" end="00:57:53.070" style="s2">permit familiar with hollow chain but</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.340" end="00:57:57.060" style="s2">but I I believe that more like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.070" end="00:58:00.510" style="s2">blockchain itself does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.060" end="00:58:02.190" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a software</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.510" end="00:58:05.730" style="s2">platform as well I mean it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.190" end="00:58:07.890" style="s2">blockchain but it is also a song yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.730" end="00:58:09.570" style="s2">they do seem somewhat analogous I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.890" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know much about and I don&#39;t know a</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.570" end="00:58:12.750" style="s2">great deal about holo and I know less</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:15.330" style="s2">about Dow so I&#39;ve only just come across</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.750" end="00:58:17.250" style="s2">down now so yeah but they do seem at</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.330" end="00:58:24.540" style="s2">first glance they do seem somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.250" end="00:58:26.750" style="s2">analogous if they&#39;re both the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.540" end="00:58:28.830" style="s2">then this seems to be unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.750" end="00:58:31.170" style="s2">competition it seems to me that some way</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.830" end="00:58:34.680" style="s2">of getting them together merging them</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.170" end="00:58:36.420" style="s2">would be a more preceive oddly similar</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.680" end="00:58:38.580" style="s2">you know finding out the differences in</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.420" end="00:58:40.290" style="s2">becoming one thing seems to me to be I</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.580" end="00:58:41.970" style="s2">think they&#39;re different enough that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.290" end="00:58:46.980" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be okay combining like their</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.970" end="00:58:48.810" style="s2">difference enough that there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.980" end="00:58:49.890" style="s2">connection and that&#39;s where so I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.810" end="00:58:51.480" style="s2">thinking and we&#39;re almost at the end</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.890" end="00:58:53.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do closing statements but</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.480" end="00:58:55.770" style="s2">before that far we actually stay on</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.040" end="00:58:57.810" style="s2">topic doing a solution raising on Dow</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.770" end="00:58:59.820" style="s2">stack and hollow chain but like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.810" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">even know what that is right like on</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.820" end="00:59:05.010" style="s2">kind of centrally owned without set like</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:05.970" style="s2">technology like how do we create utilize</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.010" end="00:59:08.490" style="s2">technology together</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.970" end="00:59:09.930" style="s2">there&#39;s Dow stack and there&#39;s holo chain</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.490" end="00:59:11.790" style="s2">and there&#39;s this like other together</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.930" end="00:59:13.230" style="s2">tech option that is like coming together</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.790" end="00:59:14.970" style="s2">and figuring it out and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.230" end="00:59:20.550" style="s2">involved and it&#39;s transparent and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.970" end="00:59:22.230" style="s2">or anything else right so examples which</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.550" end="00:59:24.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve already successfully modeled this</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.230" end="00:59:27.240" style="s2">right hmm Wikipedia being the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.660" end="00:59:29.700" style="s2">obvious yeah but I mean that&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.240" end="00:59:30.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you they don&#39;t but we</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.700" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">don&#39;t collectively own it it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.930" end="00:59:37.500" style="s2">for profit with a PDF we do collectively</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:42.290" style="s2">produce it right we collect liquid and</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.500" end="00:59:42.290" style="s2">maintain and curate it right</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.020" end="00:59:50.260" style="s2">that that&#39;s what Dow stack is for I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.270" end="00:59:55.590" style="s2">believe it&#39;s for collectively producing</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.260" end="01:00:00.130" style="s2">owning contributing to a project</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.590" end="01:00:02.890" style="s2">whatever that might be and I think Dow</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.130" end="01:00:09.640" style="s2">stock really solves the the governance</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.890" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">issue so how do you how do you go here</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.640" end="01:00:16.990" style="s2">on certain things and vote and and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:21.970" style="s2">yeah again I really don&#39;t want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.990" end="01:00:23.230" style="s2">explain it I&#39;m gonna botch it hard to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.970" end="01:00:24.730" style="s2">carry them anywhere past the hour mark</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.230" end="01:00:27.910" style="s2">would anyone like to give closing</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.730" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">statements on who are my people wrap it</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.910" end="01:00:30.940" style="s2">up</p>

<p begin="01:00:45.670" end="01:00:48.310" style="s2">one would see I was like yes run holding</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.930" end="01:00:49.870" style="s2">at same with last week but every time</p>

<p begin="01:00:58.120" end="01:01:01.420" style="s2">to the world that maybe not everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.530" end="01:01:04.630" style="s2">looking for a conversation I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.420" end="01:01:08.110" style="s2">but I will next week&#39;s idea Cafe will be</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.630" end="01:01:10.800" style="s2">doing what it&#39;s my purpose and same time</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.110" end="01:01:10.800" style="s2">same channel</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.730" end="01:01:21.070" style="s2">is it like a one-time it&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.470" end="01:01:22.390" style="s2">your purpose</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.070" end="01:01:24.160" style="s2">like what&#39;s the biggest thing you can do</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.390" end="01:01:26.260" style="s2">today and that doesn&#39;t need to be huge</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.160" end="01:01:26.920" style="s2">what&#39;s like what&#39;s the next step what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.260" end="01:01:29.110" style="s2">the next step</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.920" end="01:01:31.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole stack right because your</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.110" end="01:01:33.580" style="s2">purpose exists all start just like who</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.270" end="01:01:35.800" style="s2">who am i and who are my people exists on</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.580" end="01:01:39.390" style="s2">many levels what my purpose is right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.800" end="01:01:39.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to do the laundry or</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.260" end="01:01:46.540" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly this is why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.680" end="01:01:48.070" style="s2">having we&#39;re just trying we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.540" end="01:01:50.260" style="s2">answer the five questions then we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.070" end="01:01:51.910" style="s2">get deeper into them and maybe make</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.260" end="01:01:53.530" style="s2">groups but it&#39;s like ah I&#39;m doing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.910" end="01:01:54.940" style="s2">idea cafe and the solution racing&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.530" end="01:01:56.120" style="s2">the five questions why not just bring</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.940" end="01:01:58.670" style="s2">them all in together</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.120" end="01:02:01.070" style="s2">all right like that analogy of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.670" end="01:02:03.170" style="s2">question each of the questions being I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.070" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">still like having the burn in the center</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.170" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">as the fifth question but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:10.040" style="s2">whatever you know having the the 4/5</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.150" style="s2">zones around in a cycle right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.040" end="01:02:13.040" style="s2">going round and round around but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.150" end="01:02:15.590" style="s2">not it&#39;s not like a sequential going</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.040" end="01:02:17.180" style="s2">round around so the image of each of</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.590" end="01:02:18.710" style="s2">those chambers being filled with a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.180" end="01:02:20.150" style="s2">different color of paint right and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.710" end="01:02:23.000" style="s2">you run your finger around around around</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.150" end="01:02:25.040" style="s2">the circle and the colors all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.000" end="01:02:26.270" style="s2">swirl together into a sort of random</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.040" end="01:02:28.610" style="s2">mess even though it is still</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.270" end="01:02:30.800" style="s2">predominantly red in that sector but</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.610" end="01:02:32.600" style="s2">there&#39;s also a fair bit of yellow white</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.800" end="01:02:34.880" style="s2">and blue whatever mixed it do you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.600" end="01:02:36.880" style="s2">what I mean and so that&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.880" end="01:02:40.580" style="s2">you are at any given time you already</p>
