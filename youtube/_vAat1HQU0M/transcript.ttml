<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">be extraordinarily useful people and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:10.379" style="s2">return for that they get a percentage of</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.379" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">make their living so it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">job especially now because</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:20.040" style="s2">the market for books is well very</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.200" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">complicated and increasingly restricted</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.040" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">I would say to a few extremely</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">successful authors anyways Sally got</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">ahold of me and I had thought about for</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:33.570" style="s2">a long time about writing a more popular</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">version of my first book called maps of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.570" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">meaning and I actually produced almost a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">complete manuscript that was let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">it a simplified version or I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:49.350" style="s2">simplified exactly more well I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.610" style="s2">make it more accessible but I didn&#39;t was</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.350" end="00:02:53.880" style="s2">never really happy with it I never</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.610" end="00:02:56.340" style="s2">really felt that it that it got its legs</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:57.990" style="s2">underneath it I suppose and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.340" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">because I was duplicating something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.990" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">I had already done I was thinking very</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">hard about what to do about this and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">I might approach it because Sally was</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">interested in I thought it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:14.160" style="s2">good thing to try to write a book for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:17.190" style="s2">more general audience and we talked for</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">a while and we you know discussed a few</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.750" end="00:09:21.150" style="s2">them and then something odd happened so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.540" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">a friend of mine as a novelist Greg</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.150" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">Hurwitz and Greg wrote a book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:29.070" style="s2">become very popular called orphan X and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">one of the characters in that book the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.070" end="00:09:34.820" style="s2">female lead I would say off and on again</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:39.270" style="s2">romance interest for the main character</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.820" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">posted these rules on her fridge and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.270" end="00:09:43.010" style="s2">they were peppered throughout the book</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:47.340" style="s2">so that was kind of an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.010" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">development I thought and then because</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.340" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">they were so popular on Quora I talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.170" end="00:09:52.680" style="s2">to Sally about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:55.830" style="s2">turning them into a book and so my</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:09:59.400" style="s2">original vision was to write 42 short</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.830" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">essays I thought that would be I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.400" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">gonna call the book 42 which I thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:05.280" style="s2">was quite funny because if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.210" end="00:10:08.220" style="s2">the answer to life the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.280" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">everything from Douglas Adams was 42</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.220" end="00:10:12.960" style="s2">a computer calculated that so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:14.970" style="s2">it would be amusing to write a book</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.960" end="00:10:16.980" style="s2">called 42 that you know contained</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.970" end="00:10:19.020" style="s2">answers to life the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.980" end="00:10:22.110" style="s2">everything but when I started writing</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.020" end="00:10:24.570" style="s2">the book it turned out that I had more</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.110" end="00:10:28.890" style="s2">to say about each of the rules than I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.570" end="00:10:31.139" style="s2">had originally envisioned and so I first</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.890" end="00:10:33.389" style="s2">cut it down to 25 and wrote</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.139" end="00:10:36.269" style="s2">Messi&#39;s and then I cut it down to 16 and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.389" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">it was still too long and then I cut it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.269" end="00:10:39.569" style="s2">down to 12 which turned out to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.639" style="s2">thing anyways because if you write a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.569" end="00:10:43.410" style="s2">book you should write way more than</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.639" end="00:10:45.809" style="s2">you&#39;re going to publish and then cut</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.410" end="00:10:51.449" style="s2">because that way you you&#39;re only left</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.809" end="00:10:54.029" style="s2">with what&#39;s best so anyways I wrote for</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.449" end="00:10:55.790" style="s2">about three years well no it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.029" end="00:10:58.249" style="s2">that now I guess it&#39;s almost five years</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.790" end="00:11:01.199" style="s2">because I just finished the book in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.249" end="00:11:02.970" style="s2">September so it took about four or five</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.199" end="00:11:05.910" style="s2">years to write and I was writing pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.970" end="00:11:08.549" style="s2">regularly what I&#39;m going to do is read</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.910" end="00:11:10.549" style="s2">to you a little bit of it I think this</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.549" end="00:11:13.980" style="s2">is the book here</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.980" end="00:11:18.619" style="s2">is a preprint of a book so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.980" end="00:11:21.569" style="s2">get some sense of what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.619" end="00:11:24.389" style="s2">it&#39;s got some nice illustrations in it I</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:27.569" style="s2">itself is very apolitical with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.900" end="00:17:31.929" style="s2">exception of the chapter on</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.569" end="00:17:34.330" style="s2">skateboarding where I go into the battle</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.130" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">about lobsters rule to treat yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.340" end="00:18:04.419" style="s2">like someone you were responsible for</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.370" end="00:18:16.690" style="s2">best for you that&#39;s the chapter I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.289" end="00:18:21.070" style="s2">already read that I read the first part</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:22.750" style="s2">of it and it&#39;s about trying to organize</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.070" end="00:18:25.750" style="s2">your life so that you&#39;re surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.750" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">people who support you when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:33.549" style="s2">important rule 4 compare yourself to who</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:37.000" style="s2">you were yesterday and not to who</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.549" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">someone else is today yeah because if</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.000" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">you&#39;re comparing yourself to someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:43.179" style="s2">else I mean first of all you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">very much about the life of the person</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.179" end="00:18:46.780" style="s2">you&#39;re comparing yourself to you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.780" end="00:18:51.159" style="s2">dimensions and second people are very</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.299" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">different and so comparing yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.159" end="00:18:54.610" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:56.169" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of useful I guess when</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.610" end="00:18:58.090" style="s2">you&#39;re young but as you get older and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.169" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">more singular and more particular it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.090" end="00:19:03.549" style="s2">becomes increasingly less useful better</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.169" style="s2">to compare yourself to a previous</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.549" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">version of yourself and work for</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.799" end="00:19:14.440" style="s2">that makes you dislike them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:16.600" style="s2">probably going to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.440" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">controversial chapter I would say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.600" end="00:19:23.500" style="s2">chapter about</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:27.250" style="s2">discipline and love and respect I guess</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.500" end="00:19:29.080" style="s2">that&#39;s probably right rule 6 set your</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.250" end="00:19:31.510" style="s2">house in perfect order before you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.080" end="00:19:35.470" style="s2">criticize the world yeah well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.510" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">rough chapter man that&#39;s uh I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.470" end="00:19:40.270" style="s2">to explain the mindset behind people</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.720" end="00:19:44.920" style="s2">like the Columbine high school shooters</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.270" end="00:19:47.890" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a harsh chapter rule</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.920" end="00:19:51.070" style="s2">7 pursue what is meaningful and not what</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.890" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">is expedient expedient is what works in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.070" end="00:19:57.610" style="s2">the short term expedience what&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:20:01.900" style="s2">meaningful instead is what sustains you</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.610" end="00:20:05.380" style="s2">through tragedy let&#39;s say rule 8 tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.900" end="00:20:06.910" style="s2">the truth or at least don&#39;t lie yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.380" end="00:20:08.890" style="s2">well it&#39;s not that easy to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.910" end="00:20:11.710" style="s2">truth because who knows about the truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.890" end="00:20:13.720" style="s2">but you can learn not to say things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.710" end="00:20:15.970" style="s2">you know to be false and if you stop</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.720" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">saying things that you know to be false</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.970" end="00:20:20.620" style="s2">then your life will improve a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:23.050" style="s2">simplifies it and it puts you in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.620" end="00:20:24.460" style="s2">alignment with reality and you should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.050" end="00:20:25.810" style="s2">in alignment with reality because</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.460" end="00:20:30.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more of it than there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.810" end="00:20:32.620" style="s2">of you rule 9 assume that the person</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.010" end="00:20:36.010" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to might know something</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.620" end="00:20:37.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t that&#39;s a good one because and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.010" end="00:20:39.390" style="s2">this is even true when you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.240" end="00:20:42.340" style="s2">with people that don&#39;t like you because</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.390" end="00:20:44.980" style="s2">they may offer you criticisms that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.340" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">valid many that aren&#39;t - of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.980" end="00:20:49.150" style="s2">because maybe they&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:51.250" style="s2">take you down a bit but if you get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.150" end="00:20:54.850" style="s2">criticism that&#39;s valid and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.250" end="00:20:56.890" style="s2">fix that error let&#39;s say that&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.850" end="00:20:59.080" style="s2">you from running nose-first into walls</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.890" end="00:21:03.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s generally a handy thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.080" end="00:21:06.460" style="s2">rule 10 be precise in your speech yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.550" end="00:21:08.440" style="s2">well you have to be exacting in the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.460" end="00:21:09.940" style="s2">that you describe things and the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.440" end="00:21:11.680" style="s2">that you think because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.940" end="00:21:14.680" style="s2">live in the fog and you won&#39;t get what</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.680" end="00:21:18.040" style="s2">you should out of life or what you need</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.680" end="00:21:19.630" style="s2">out of life and by need I mean what will</p>
