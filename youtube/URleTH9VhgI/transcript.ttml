<p begin="00:00:54.640" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">reconnect to something i spent quite a</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">researching and i guess reflecting on as</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">i went through the journey of being an</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">entrepreneur i worked with a fellow</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:10.720" style="s2">named</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">dane who had a foundation that taught</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.720" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">entrepreneurial skills</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:18.799" style="s2">and one of the core</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">interventions that we ended up offering</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.799" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">for that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">the opportunity to give people some</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">deep insights into how their own</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">emotional history was limiting</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.159" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">their success as an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">and that turned out to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:39.680" style="s2">of a highlight of the program</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">uh for the time that i was there and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">also did some interesting research</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">on um the personality characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">uh we had about a hundred people who had</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">applied to be part of the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">now peter are you able to admit people</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">or do i need to keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">you&#39;ll do it i&#39;ll do it yeah awesome</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">there&#39;s two people there</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">um and and we did</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">some really interesting research uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">whenever i get involved in data analysis</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">i tend to find</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">uh odd odd and interesting ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">approaching stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">and uh i came up with an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">where we had about a hundred hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">fifty uh i forget the numbers people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">were in the training program who took</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">the hexaco which is the five factor</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">personality scale with about</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">20 subscales and we also managed to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">20 graduates of the program who had</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">actually closer to 30 who had become</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">successes</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">who had made millions of dollars um</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">and so instead of just looking at their</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">profiles and seeing how they compared</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">to ordinary people which we just do by</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">at normative data for the hexagon we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">actually compared</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">their subscale scores with the what</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">with the aspiring entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">and found that there was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">10 of the 30 or whatever sub scales that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">really predicted</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">who would become successful and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">spend a little bit of time on that but</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s interesting about it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">that when we look closely at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">subscales there was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">clearly emotional components to things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">so one of the stuff one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">about when i</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">talk or teach or uh do these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">inter</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">these kinds of programs i really love to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">audience participation because it guides</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">me into</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">speaking in ways that are relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">you guys so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">uh in a way that we can i can see half</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">the screen here</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">uh if i um if everyone who can</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">puts on their um their screens you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">so that i can just see you i&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">full screen for a second</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">um how many of you are actively involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">in being entrepreneurs right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">if you just you know put up your hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">okay quite a bit um in fact almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">everybody that i can see on my screen</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">um and how many of you have come to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna paraphrase this and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">over emphasize it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">that you&#39;re your own worst enemy</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">all right then you are my target</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">audience i i think you&#39;re really going</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">with what i&#39;m talking about um</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">i&#39;m going to pull over to my my rome</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">notes and just glance and make sure i</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">stay</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">on topic here um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">one of the things that i think if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">know my work</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">i&#39;m very much interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">and i work within what i call the four</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">facets of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">which i used to think was a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">um kind of context but now i really see</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">that it&#39;s very much of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">personal growth transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">from this framework there are four</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">distinct dimensions that we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">go through</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">to become really complete and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">well-welded human beings</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">and when i have spent my time</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">as a clinician for the last 20 25 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">and then as a life coach</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve come to appreciate that there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">i would say three</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">archetypal paths of transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">our culture right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">and one of them is the the explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">spiritual path where you go to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">monastery or you commit to a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">practice and you make that a major part</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">of your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">and it will transform you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">the other path that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">really come to appreciate and i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">say has been a large component of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">because unlike what i thought i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">become a priest or a monastic i</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">i ended up getting married which</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">surprised the hell out of me um</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">but that second path is a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">committed relationship whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">marriage or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">where you use the friction of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">and the tension between the two of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">cues for transformation so</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">to me for people who are really</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">interested in deep transformation on all</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:42.319" style="s2">four facets not just the first one</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">but all four facets</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.319" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">a relationship path is probably more</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">intense than a monastic path</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">okay the monastic path is really good</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">for waking up</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">relationship path is really good for</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">cleaning up because all your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">baggage will get activated</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">you know in a long-term relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">it will help you with the growing up</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">which is the third facet</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">and in the process you will disidentify</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">from a lot of these dimensions which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">the waking up path it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">probably the relationship path is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">enough to take you all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">pinnacle of the waking up piece but</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;ll take you a long way</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">in terms of becoming a functional human</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">being and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">the fourth dimension the fourth facet</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">that i work within is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">the um i don&#39;t ken wilber talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">is the showing up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">and i actually see showing up as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">developmental stage</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">i i think the fourth facet is actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">the um looking around or what are you</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">sensitive to so if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re oblivious to interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">body language</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">or emotions and and subtle</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">you know non-verbal cues if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">oblivious to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a difficult time</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">having a healthy relationship with your</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">partner or anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">right and so the fourth facet is really</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">becoming sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">all of the dimensions that we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">capable of perceiving as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">and if you&#39;re into the shamanistic world</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">that includes exploring the subtle</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">realms</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">astral travel lucid dreaming shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">journeying</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">waking up to those other realms okay but</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">it also has a very tangible</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">applied thing of just being sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">the world around you and picking up all</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">the cues that you can to process them in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">your relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">your journey so we&#39;ve got the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the relationship path and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">would say the uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">yeah peter that&#39;s it it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">showing i i would</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">not it&#39;s not the integrating uh it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">um i</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">integrated um i call it perceptual loci</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">or or um you could say showing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">up to all dimensions but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">way of meaning it than ken welder means</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the monastic path we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">the relationship path and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">the third archetypal path that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">used for transformation when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:26.200" style="s2">people like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">tony robbins and evan pagan is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.200" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">entrepreneurial path</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">that if you notice so many of those</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">workshops on entrepreneurial success</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">have deep levels of personal and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">transformational growth exercises in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">and what we&#39;re going to do is look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">why that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">and one of the reasons that i like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">entrepreneurial path</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">is that as you do this work and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">what i evidenced as i worked with people</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">at uh danes foundation</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">people who did their work got past the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">blocks they needed for a particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">of the entrepreneurial path that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">couldn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">through and once they got past the block</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">and they made it past the stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">money started coming in or their</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">networking started increasing and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">translated into fiscal success fairly</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">because a lot of these people had done a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">lot of the stages and were just stuck</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">at one place and once they opened that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">kind of bottleneck</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">the whole pipeline started flowing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">money started coming in so like</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">what an awesome bonus that not only do</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">you get an increased</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">quality of life but you get like</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">you get it reflected in the success of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">your business ventures so</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna pause there and just ask for</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">questions on anything that i&#39;ve said so</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">i get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">how this is resonating and what&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">sense to you guys and then we&#39;ll move on</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">what i pulled up is the five stages of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">an entrepreneurial movement towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">success in starting a business so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">why don&#39;t some of you uh ask some</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">questions or tell me how this is landing</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">on you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">would you like them to unmute themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">or put in the trap off yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">you can unmute yourself we&#39;ll go popcorn</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">style or if you want to raise your hand</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">i can get it in the participants list um</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">and we can go that way but we&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">popcorn style unless it gets to be too</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">hard to keep up with okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">so on john has something that chats it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">seems like he just wants a clarification</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">question so there are three paths and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">four ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">up in that that&#39;s his question</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">yeah yeah uh the three paths that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">the monastic the uh the relational and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">the entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:54.320" style="s2">they seem to be the archetypes right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.320" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">you know for deep transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">where there&#39;s lots of resources being</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">devoted to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">um george yeah if you want to just</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">unmute and speak okay i guess what in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">regards to the showing up to all</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">is that something that you seek out or</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:18.000" style="s2">that is that something that you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">take on as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">uh as you experience uh different</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">uh dimensions uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">my experience has been as as you do like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">you can do that path</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">explicitly um and and i kind of refer to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">that as the shamanistic path</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">uh but it doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">um you know think of an autistic person</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">their inability to process cues because</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">they just don&#39;t see them</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">so to the extent that you&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">cues</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get friction in your</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">attending to them the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">seems to happen is as</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">people do enough cleaning up and growing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">their sensitivity naturally increases</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">and their curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">increases and these other dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">start just emerging naturally</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably the safest way to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">the shamanistic path</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">you know especially if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">be getting into the lucid dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">and uh you know the dream yogas and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">and all the other worlds that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">involved or taking ethniogems and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">you know moving into apparently other</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">uh about like your thoughts on autism</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">like the kind of pathology um</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">that he has that he has gone through i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">to start handling that process and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve watched there&#39;s actually a great</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">program in toronto</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">where people are recovering way higher</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">that they had lost uh as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">this very systematic training program</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">that&#39;s focused on developing new neurons</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">how far you can take that you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">really don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">in terms of autism or what or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">oh okay yeah thank you that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">insightful thanks</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">all right so douglas thanks for doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">this uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">i like hearing these three different</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">ways of doing it and i i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">these days a lot of us are having a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">of challenges around</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">the feedback we get from direct market</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">and that we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">finances as not a great measure of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">what we want to create in the world i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">certainly speaking for myself</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m just wondering if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">insights around how to better be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">social entrepreneur or conscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">capitalist in this to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">integrate all three of these together or</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">to to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">see some other dimensions of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">activity that we do that still provides</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">a livelihood but maybe through more</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">social capital or through other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">that um that we know are supporting our</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">communities and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">inevitably our our world uh our global</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">global uh ecological systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">forth that&#39;s a great question daryl and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">uh and i would</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:40.800" style="s2">you know my first response is that uh we</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">we best see that which we measure so i</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">pulled out</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">money as a measurement because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">measures with money but if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">if your value system is different and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna measure social impact</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">i mean and i&#39;ve done interventions for</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">rehabilitation and the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">have to do is define your outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">and start measuring them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">can get feedback as to whether your</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">interventions or what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">is affecting them so whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">interested in whatever it is you value</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">you should start measuring and finding</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">ways to assess it and use that as</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">as you move towards your goal um</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">i actually have a blog post that i</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">haven&#39;t released yet because i haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">so yeah go ahead well i was just going</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">section but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">you wanted to say something that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">be great agreeing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s these other things are more</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">intangible and i look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">new metrics that are able to better</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">measure our</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">carbon footprint and probably there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">lot better better things to measure</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">and i look forward to your blog when it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">comes out sounds like a great</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">point thanks so what i&#39;m going to do now</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.039" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to come up i i pulled out a uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">a blog that someone had written on um</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">the five critical stages you&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">through as an entrepreneur by stan</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">uh edom and i i picked him only because</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">he was the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">popular one on the search engine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">a lot of different ways to cut the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">stages</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">um i would probably have put them into</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">quadrants and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">but this is probably the most accessible</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:43.039" style="s2">and as we go through the stages i want</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">you to relate to which stage you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.039" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">in which stage you feel like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">completed</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">and which stages maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">stalling at and we&#39;re probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">get a little bit of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">in that context and then i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">have you guys complete</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">an actual um entrepreneurial assessment</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">that i put together</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">where you&#39;ll focus on the place where</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">you&#39;re bottlenecked</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to look for some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">core feelings that emerge</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">and when i refer to core feelings that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">part of my framework where i believe</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">genetically biologically programmed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">ourselves in relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">and in relationship to other people on</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">these nine</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">core dimensions which we experience as</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">feelings so i can</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">feel significant or insignificant</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">to my partner or to the world or to my</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">uh job or you know to you people</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">and how i feel will greatly</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">impact on how i show up to the world or</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">how i show up</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">to the relationship and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">often the so there&#39;s that&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">of insignificant there&#39;s helpless</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">inadequate potent and powerful versus</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">helpless adequate versus inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">um lost versus having a vision and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">depending on the impressions that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">from your childhood or sometimes your</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">you know formative years if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">traumas as an adult</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">you&#39;re going to introject some of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">feelings and you&#39;re going to over</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">generalize them</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">to your situations so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">you know and i maybe i can even ask that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">um how many of you people</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">you know how many of you out there have</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">realized that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">show up to relationships in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">and feel a certain way regardless of who</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">the person is or</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">very often or you feel a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">whenever money comes up</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">you know like that you&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">there are feelings</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">involved and i&#39;ve got some hands</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">okay wonderful and so what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">the bioemotive framework is you get a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">very explicit</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">language for capturing those feeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">energies</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">into very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">categories that you can do something</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">with you can process</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">and start working on more explicitly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">more rationally than just</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">being subject to them it helps you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:33.280" style="s2">disidentify</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">and you can also clean it out from your</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.280" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">system and this will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">clearer to you once you do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">assessment okay so</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna just go through the five</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">critical stages now</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">and i guess to finish once you do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">assessment</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get an email back to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">highlighting one of the challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">you may be having</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">and and it&#39;s almost like an astrological</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">chart but it&#39;s just going to be based on</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">of your feelings not a but and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">going to be a general thing people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">have the burden of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">helplessness will often experience blah</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">when they&#39;re trying to be an</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">entrepreneur people who have the burden</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:18.159" style="s2">worthlessness will often find it</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">challenging to do the following right</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.159" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s what you&#39;ll get back and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">i think doug is threatening us with this</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">playfully interesting i don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">to look at it but i&#39;m glad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:34.799" style="s2">playfully</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">um so what i want you to do is look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.799" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">these stages</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">and i want you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">imagine what&#39;s involved in</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">doing that stage and how often</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">a feeling comes up when you think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:55.039" style="s2">that so the first stage is finding the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">right business idea i&#39;ll overview the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.039" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">stages first</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">developing a business plan raising your</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">seed funding getting paying customers</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">and then becoming a success or a failure</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s some really broad categories</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">now what does it mean to find the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">business idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">you have to be creative insightful</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">have focus you have to have empathy</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">you know what do your potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">customers want even if they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">they want it and you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">a minimal viable product that you could</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">like start</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">testing out for viability</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">so when you think of that stage how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">people are at that stage of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">entrepreneurial business</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">where they&#39;re coming up with an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">for those of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">past it you know what was it like</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">you know like when i say you&#39;ve got to</p>

<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s usually not the stumbling</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">block for most people</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">um does anyone want to share what it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">like to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">think about being creative and</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">challenging and how they</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">got past that particular step</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">uh i&#39;d like to share sure adam sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">um so i&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">a few bursts in the last few years of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">creative energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">and uh they happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">like like 18 months to two years apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">and each time it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">i get really high on the energy and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">i and i get really manic</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">and i&#39;ll do something silly like</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.559" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">buy a plane ticket that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t need or buy a url</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">and start the whole like design process</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">i get really high on the creative</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">to my own destruction and this last</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">time around my wife really helped me</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">calm down and realize it and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:50.840" style="s2">starting to approach everything from a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">less manic</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.840" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">state now that&#39;s beautiful and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">shows the potential drawback of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">creative process</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.159" end="00:27:01.679" style="s2">when it can get overwhelming and take</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.679" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">and you basically lose perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">luckily your wife helped you keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">perspective and i would say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">first facet disidentification you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">recognize that energy and not get</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">carried away with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">the way you did in the past and so now</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">you can start</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">using it and channeling it the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">thing that i hear going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">is that you&#39;re not in control of when</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">those creative bursts</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">happen and and that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">about an</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">entrepreneurial world is that many of us</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">are we we wait for the creativity</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">and we don&#39;t realize that creativity</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">like many other dimensions of being can</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">be cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">and nurtured and made a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">conscious and explicit that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">have to be subject to the random</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">fluctuations of your creativity but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">can learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">to cultivate and nurture it like find</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">your muse</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">so to speak so that&#39;s a great example of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">you know the pros and cons of you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">the first step</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have the creativity</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s often easy to just drop out of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">right there and why would you drop out</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">because you&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">feel something like hopelessness</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">right so i&#39;m gonna just look at andrew</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">he had mentioned that he had trouble</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">with the creativity</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">is that a feeling that came up for you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">on the entrepreneurial journey</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">oh yeah like with the hope</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">hopelessness like i i didn&#39;t want to be</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">right right and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed and to feel</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">especially if you don&#39;t have an explicit</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed in those</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">first steps</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">if you realize that you can hire a guide</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">and help you through those steps because</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone through it</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">but to do that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">interpersonal skills and sense of</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">assessment</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re going to start</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">playing with that as variables to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">well where are the thresholds by which i</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">need to you know charge so</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">when i talk about doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">analysis for developing</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">a business plan how many people get</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">excited and how many people find</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">falling away from this</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">part of their journey how many people</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">i&#39;m noticing nathan is laughing do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.679" style="s2">want to share a little bit here</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">nathan on what what this means to you it</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.679" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">incites like a deep panic in me a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">democratic</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just like so overwhelming the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">figuring out this really complicated uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">mathematical like charting out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">possible what&#39;s going to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">taking all these factors into account</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">and i just like</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">just like i just want to make stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">assessment</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">and yet if you don&#39;t do this right</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">you&#39;re screwed because i&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">people bring products</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">to the marketplace only to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">charge enough to make it worth their</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">they didn&#39;t do the cost estimates you</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">know and they put a lot of time and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">energy into it</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve i&#39;ve invested in a company</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">called three guys greens</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">and we did spreadsheets and i actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">love statistics and mathematics and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">spreadsheets and</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">programming so i wrote you know variable</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">functions and looking at thresholds and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">finding optimal things</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">and we bought the equipment based on</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:54.080" style="s2">and then found out that they messed up</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">on their estimates of the production of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.080" end="00:32:58.240" style="s2">the equipment we bought</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">and it completely blew our business plan</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.240" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">right so we had to scramble and actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">build our equipment</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">you know uh by scratch almost from</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">in an ad hoc way not the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">quality as they they delivered to us but</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">we saved a lot because we understood the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">process at that time</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">and we&#39;ve now brought our production</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">levels back up to what they should have</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">but like it almost destroyed our</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">business because those estimates weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">accurate but</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t our fault right and and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">just ignore that piece and hope it goes</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">away or hope they&#39;re successful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">i&#39;ll build a good enough product that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">right it&#39;ll just bring in the money and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">have to worry about you know my my</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">margins like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">that&#39;s usually not true how many people</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">have got that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">sense that it doesn&#39;t matter i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">going to build a good enough product</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">that i don&#39;t have to worry about margins</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">per se</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">it could be true it could be true but</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">often you have to be very aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">because as soon as you start getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">you have to hire people to do things to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">keep up with the volumes and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">got to make sure that you can afford to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">do that and still keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">you know price points competitive uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">michael you wanted to share something</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">uh yeah um there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">so i i have a very mathematical mind i</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">used to do this kind of work for</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">a company that i built with some other</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">people in california so i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">familiar with this dimension</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">um but a trouble that i run into is at</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">least in my mind and in my my</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">sort of energetic emotional experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">that kind of thinking is antithetical to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">the creative process</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">i can sort of get momentum on one or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">but there&#39;s a clear trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:52.000" style="s2">them on the time scale</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">of days and weeks so i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.000" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">like if you&#39;ve encountered this and if</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">so do you have a way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">navigate that so you&#39;re saying that when</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;re in a creative mode you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">access the mathematical capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">uh it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s it&#39;s more like uh i</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">i can look look at the spreadsheets and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">the planning and i can see how the math</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">works and i can see ah and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">this can appeal to this market and here</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">and very very analytic</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">thinking about how the whole thing works</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">and then if the energy the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">emotional tone that i use for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">is still in me when i turn towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">how i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">interact with people or what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">products i&#39;m going to put together</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">there&#39;s almost it&#39;s almost like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">a functional exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">way of operating that dominates the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">that&#39;s antithetical to the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">but if i get into sort of the the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">open relational dimension of oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">what i want to make this is what i want</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">to cause in the world this is what i</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">really care about</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">i find that it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s like the spreadsheets feel like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">they&#39;re adding blades to my gut</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just not it doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s what&#39;s beautiful is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">depicting in one person what i hear in</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">often in separate people</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">you know that they&#39;ve got one modality</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">or the other and they can&#39;t switch back</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:23.040" style="s2">and forth and you&#39;re lucky you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">switch</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.040" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">but they are different parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">neural substrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">and and um they do seem sometimes to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">be inhibitory i know when i&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">lot of statistical work</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a really hard for me to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">and write a report on a client</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">and i&#39;ve learned that i have to take</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">some time to prime myself</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">to slowly nurture my brain into that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">so i&#39;ve consciously kind of created some</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">programs or instructions for myself that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">prime my brain into thinking a certain</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">right for me i can easily move between</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">the creative</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.200" style="s2">and the mathematical statistical because</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">i find statistical mathematical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.200" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">extremely creative so they&#39;re very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">in the same world</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">but as soon as i have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">writing about interpersonal dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">and i&#39;m in that brain it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">work i have to what i find is i sit down</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">and i&#39;ll just read a report that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">written already</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">in the past and that starts those</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">neurons firing</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">and then i can certainly move into that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">world and start writing</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a disidentification process first</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">facet</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">that i can name the thing instead of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">just getting caught in it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">and moving into a depression or a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">hopelessness because my mind isn&#39;t there</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">i hope that&#39;s helpful you know i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">i&#39;m weaving in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">other things besides the emotional stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to raising your seed</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">funding and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">often challenging um how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">just trying to do it with their own</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">money and time and how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">actually needing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">ask for money you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">how many people are asking for money</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">because if you ask for money you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">to go to relatives or investors</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see anybody raising their</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">hand for</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">asking for money does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">everybody&#39;s fairly independently wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">and just have their the finances to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">to pay for everything you need here</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">i have a conflict on that point uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">by trying to do something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">a like a tech startup and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">raise funds in the traditional way i</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">convinced myself that it would be better</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">to develop in open source and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">trust the community to provide based on</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">the value they see</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">in the product and this is a core</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if i retreated into that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">because i&#39;m too afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">asking for money</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a wonderful question to have and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:18.320" style="s2">i think a really important one because</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re going to the social</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">commons and the social good</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">and assuming it will turn into</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">fiscal you know reimbursement</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">i think peter actually went through that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">stage peter you you had uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">a quote that you passed on to us a while</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">ago do you remember what it was</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">and on the third or the fourth time they</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">feeling that you had yeah the feelings</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">there was doubt you know who am i to</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">so inadequacy i guess and also feeling</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">stuck you know hopeless like i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">really trying the past months it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">going anywhere but then came detour the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">thought of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">i did not do all these steps that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">planned because of this hopelessness and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">then i got</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">new energy like yeah i will just try</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">okay so what your your outlining is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:25.200" style="s2">i&#39;m going to turn your mute you because</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">you&#39;re there&#39;s a bounce back</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.200" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">he he just did a great sharing of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">hopeless and feeling inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">and the fact that he could name them</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">gives you some distance from them and</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">he&#39;s in my nadura group so i know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">gone through this</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">and and he&#39;s felt this you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">your emotions and feelings as seriously</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">when you can name them it takes a while</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">but you&#39;ll start having them as</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">feelings as opposed to being who you are</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">and then what he did is we went back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">his original</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:03.640" style="s2">vision and re-stimulated his purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">so that it could kind of override and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.640" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">re-enthusiast</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">re recreate the enthusiasm he had for</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">why he was doing it it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">to lose track of your vision which gives</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">you the energy and the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:17.839" style="s2">when you get caught in these other</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">emotions of hopelessness and inadequacy</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">and who am</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">and process it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">so that we can work with the feelings</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">now processing feelings can be upsetting</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re not used to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">don&#39;t do this if you&#39;re feeling fragile</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">okay i don&#39;t think this is the case for</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">you guys</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">you can also just distance yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">stop if you get too deeply triggered</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">everything here is confidential it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:39.040" style="s2">going to be collected for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to continue doing data</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.040" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">analysis on it but um</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">it will never be shared with your names</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">on it in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">that gets stripped off from the data</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">that i do analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">so if you put your email address in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">there that&#39;s the only mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s that i can send you the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">results put in your name or an alias</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:02.160" style="s2">and then just get a sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">when you see</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.160" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">you know how much do you see your fears</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">and psychological issues as barriers to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">your success</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">right now and just get a sense like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">talking about how important is it but</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">how real</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">is it for you how aware is it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">and maybe you don&#39;t have many fears and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.319" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">psychological issues</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">so you don&#39;t have to put it high but if</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">you do and you can see the impact</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">just try and get a sense of them and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">then how direct how committed are you to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:34.800" style="s2">directly find and face those barriers</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">in order to be successful and this was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">really informative set of questions for</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">us to look at who was actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">in doing this work in becoming you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">successful entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">so go on to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">i want you to think i don&#39;t have it here</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">i want you to think of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">barrier that you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">okay and and it&#39;s not rational but see</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">if you can like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">articulate it in a sentence like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">having a trouble</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">phoning people to get interest or to see</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">if they want to buy my product or</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">um i&#39;m having trouble coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">whatever it is your barrier is</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">and once you find it</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">ask yourself you know in that context</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">sometimes a part of me feels</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">very alone and just rate how much</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">activation you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">right maybe the whole entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">enterprise you feel very alone</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">and and makes you sad but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">sacrifice you&#39;re willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">in order to gain that that success but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">you&#39;re still sad that you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">to work every day</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">and meeting with colleagues and other</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have the same pressures</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">sometimes a part of me feels very</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">and just let your body emotional system</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">see how it responds to that situation</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:12.319" style="s2">i feel inadequate that means i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">really prepared</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.319" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">to do this i could if i spent the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">but i&#39;m not prepared</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">or i feel very insignificant</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to bother people i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">want to take up their time</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t notice me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">sometimes a part of me feels very lost</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">or i feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">lost when i get to this point</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">i feel helpless 0 to ten</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">sometimes a part of me feels very</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">worthless or</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">i feel worthless</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">if you feel worthless it&#39;ll be really</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">hard for you to take anyone&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">to ask for resources to spend the money</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">that you need to get the training</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">that you need to do this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">this one a deep emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">it can be loss but generally if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">been around a long time it&#39;s experienced</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">as an emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">and in this context that&#39;s how we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">a feeling of loss that doesn&#39;t resolve</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">over time will often become a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">emptiness or a hole in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">or the positive feeling once lived</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:42.559" style="s2">and see if there&#39;s a sense of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:44.880" style="s2">maybe you lost a partner</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.559" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">in this and you&#39;ve never quite gotten</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.880" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">over it</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:51.119" style="s2">you feel abandoned or alone right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">there&#39;s an emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.119" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">it doug yeah i might have missed</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">you saying this um do we focus on this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">question that&#39;s surrounded like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">entrepreneurialism</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">uh or just in general because i&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">different things come up</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">well yeah and so i i didn&#39;t have you</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">write it down but this should be in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">specific context where you feel a block</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">in your entrepreneurial success where</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">challenged right now and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">different for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">okay this is an old form and the new</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">ones have a space</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">for placing the context so you&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">have to remember in your head what this</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:36.839" style="s2">this other one i feel like a bad person</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:40.960" style="s2">you know i shouldn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">um it wouldn&#39;t be right to interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.960" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">the ceo from his day he&#39;s a busy man</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.520" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">and i would be bad to do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">or it&#39;s bad to make money you know and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a block that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">some people have very negative</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">associations to money</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">um a part of me feels very hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">when this scenario comes up</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a space for any other</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">feelings</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">the nine core feelings will get them but</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:22.720" style="s2">there might be interpersonal feelings</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:22.720" style="s2">that you can list here</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">and then these other ones you can answer</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">or not they were useful for us</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">you know when you wake up in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">how often do you feel refreshed relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">and alert</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">you know i would put a 10 on that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">i&#39;m i assume that everybody felt like</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">that for the longest time and then i</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">they don&#39;t uh some people are always at</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">a two or a three but that makes a big</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">difference on</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">how likely you are to succeed if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">not waking up with</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">a good pool of physical energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to be emotionally successful</p>

<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">how relaxed are you most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">if it&#39;s not at all you know uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">going to be challenging and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">actually showed up</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">on um on our entrepreneurial things is</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">that successful entrepreneurs were not</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">anxious and did not have a lot of fear</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">whereas a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">aspiring entrepreneurs had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">anxiety and fear</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.400" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">and that was something they had to work</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">on when you&#39;re faced with a conflict by</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">between yourself and another person</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">do you tend to get angry sad fearful</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">anxious agitated tense</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">or do you kind of move towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:44.720" style="s2">calm and peace it&#39;s probably too extreme</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">to say complete common piece but</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.720" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">most people will move in</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">one of those directions the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.040" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">more emotional ones are clearer if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">body agitation and things you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.599" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">emotions and tensions and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re not aware of the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">stuff and that&#39;s that&#39;s okay that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">where you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">right now and hopefully you&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">waking up to the emotional energies</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">um how would you rank yourself in terms</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">of relating to emotions and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">not at all connected as a one in ten as</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">you you feel and embrace them</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">completely uh this is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.799" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">uh for long-term health is how often do</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">you cry</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">you know when you need to if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">crying all the time that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">not good if you&#39;re crying when you need</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">to maybe once a week or once a month</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">depending on your life</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a good sign if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.559" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t cried for years</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">or since you&#39;re a young child that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">either means you&#39;ve led a blessed life</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">or you&#39;ve got a lot of repression</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">those will be obstacles to your success</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">how what are your feelings about</p>

<p begin="01:00:25.839" end="01:00:30.559" style="s2">minutes now to read</p>

<p begin="01:00:30.559" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">and uh see how it resonates for you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">someone&#39;s asking if there&#39;s particular</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.640" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">postures or positions to make it easier</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">to feel the feelings</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">in general you want to be as relaxed as</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:46.799" style="s2">right so whatever that means for me that</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">means in a half lotus</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.799" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">with a little bit of support on my lower</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:53.839" style="s2">back and that&#39;s the most relaxing</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">position i can be in for the people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">are saying i&#39;m needing more time to</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">resonate</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">with the statements that&#39;s fine you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">do this again</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">uh but likely one of them will</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">feel more true and you can just respond</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">to that if you do it again and something</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:12.960" style="s2">else resonates then</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:12.960" style="s2">read what that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">so let me just</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">pull that up now</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.680" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna look how many people got</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">um a</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">core feeling of inadequacy</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">if you just put up your hands okay so</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:38.240" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna read this out and i want you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">to share with me what it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.240" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">how true it feels</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">entrepreneurs who carry the burden of</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.960" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">inadequacy</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">often feel like they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:51.200" style="s2">skills or qualifications to succeed in</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">their vision</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.200" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">and are prone to under charge for their</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:57.119" style="s2">services</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">they can get stuck at the dreaming stage</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.119" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">of being an entrepreneur and never move</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">beyond it</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">if they get their businesses going they</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">never feel like they&#39;ve accomplished</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:09.280" style="s2">and tend to overwork themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">compensate for feeling and not</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">inadequate often not damaging their</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:36.319" style="s2">um inadequacy based on</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">incoherence meaning not being incoherent</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.319" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">my business is kind of zero-sum</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.799" end="01:02:51.760" style="s2">or excuse me yeah zero sum competitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">transactional based in some ways game a</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.760" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">and i would like to move my professional</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">space so um i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.839" end="01:03:11.680" style="s2">i can shift the business um</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">with some new heuristics to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.680" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">um but i&#39;m feeling like the coherence</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t ideal because</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that the service provided</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.760" end="01:03:29.440" style="s2">is when you have the transactional</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">component</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.440" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">it complicates things so i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">in other words it</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:44.160" style="s2">how do you uh suggest that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:47.200" style="s2">entrepreneurs um who have</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.160" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">um transactional based businesses or</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.200" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">that have to become transactional to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">some degree to make a living</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">how do you cohere that with this</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">collaborative structure because</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">at some point do you get more clients</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:03.119" style="s2">do you make more money well here here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">inadequacy possibly in your</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.200" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">inability to have formed an inadequate</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:13.599" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">for this endeavor so in the three guys</p>

<p begin="01:04:49.200" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">you know same with the circling um often</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.240" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">if you approach us</p>

<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:00.400" style="s2">work something out so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:02.559" style="s2">social responsibility so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.400" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">come up with a vision that we feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.559" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">marries the transactional with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">and that took some time to develop um</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">karen hargrave has a great book</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">out there called pay what you can and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">know um</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.200" style="s2">vincent horn&#39;s doing that with his uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:19.599" style="s2">his teaching as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.200" end="01:05:20.960" style="s2">so it just takes some creativity and</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.599" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">ingenuity</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:25.760" style="s2">but it does take time for your specific</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:29.440" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.760" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">okay um so thanks for the question i</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.440" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">hope that was helpful</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking instead of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">me going through each of them does</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:42.480" style="s2">people want to just share</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:44.079" style="s2">any strong feelings that came up as they</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.480" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">went through the program anything that</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.079" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">surprised them</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:49.599" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll either read the the you</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">know the blurb</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.599" end="01:05:54.079" style="s2">or we&#39;ll just interact on it in a way</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">that might be helpful</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.079" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">so who had any some strong or surprising</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:00.079" style="s2">feelings that came up when they</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">went through the core feelings</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.079" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">assessment on the particular issue they</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">trying to work with</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.039" end="01:06:12.400" style="s2">how about moderate feelings</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">i had</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">you know what uh i&#39;ll let stephen</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">stephen talk okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.799" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">yes stephen</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">are you going to speak okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.920" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">sorry someone else speaking yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">uh yeah i had a question um you</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">mentioned loss</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:55.520" style="s2">can we distinguish that from lost</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:58.400" style="s2">feeling a sense of loss seems different</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.520" end="01:06:59.920" style="s2">than being lost a bit of confused or</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.400" end="01:07:01.920" style="s2">overwhelmed how would you distinguish</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.920" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">this who or where&#39;s the overlap</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.920" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">oh very very very different feelings um</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">loss means you once had a positive</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">feeling experience</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">and it could be anything the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">significance connection and cared for</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">um value were you know worth and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:21.359" style="s2">you lost it so if you were the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:22.799" style="s2">valuable player on the basketball team</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.359" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">and broke your leg</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.799" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">you&#39;d feel a huge loss of no longer</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">feeling valued</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">and you might also feel lost</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:34.079" style="s2">because you no longer have a vision that</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">you can enact</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.079" end="01:07:37.119" style="s2">that brings meaning to your life but</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:39.359" style="s2">they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">separate dimensions if you if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.359" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">have a vision</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.400" style="s2">you will be lost so andy is an example</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.839" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.400" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">trying to marry two things that seem</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:49.839" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">and he has no vision that can allow him</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:54.960" style="s2">to move forward so he&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:56.400" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t know how to make sense of his</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.960" end="01:07:58.640" style="s2">world in a way that he can be</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.400" end="01:08:02.000" style="s2">constructive</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.640" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">okay i guess in my case it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.000" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">the loss</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.960" style="s2">i think i have much greater sense of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:10.240" style="s2">meaning than i did before</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.960" end="01:08:13.119" style="s2">with say an earlier successful</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.240" end="01:08:13.599" style="s2">entrepreneurial venture ventures but</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.119" end="01:08:16.719" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.599" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">a lot more confusing</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.719" end="01:08:20.400" style="s2">to get those ideas into something that</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.400" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">you know the right business model just</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.839" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">choosing that or the right target market</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">and all those things</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:30.960" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s more emotional than uh then i</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.960" end="01:08:34.560" style="s2">you know i</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked to you know that my you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.560" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">rich network and the you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.159" end="01:08:40.159" style="s2">the startup ecosystem they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:42.719" style="s2">not helping</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.159" end="01:08:44.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t feel like i get the right help</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.719" end="01:08:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.560" end="01:08:50.560" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s i i relate</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.600" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">to the feeling lost and not knowing who</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.560" end="01:08:54.159" style="s2">your target audience is</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">and one of the reasons or one of the</p>

<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">and not so shocked but it was like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.040" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">core feeling was alone</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:08.400" style="s2">like it was i could i was in sales</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">i could sell somebody else&#39;s product</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.400" end="01:11:12.320" style="s2">and i there&#39;s that feeling like a bad</p>

<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:22.159" style="s2">a block it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.159" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">eye-opening because it was like oh i</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.159" end="01:11:26.719" style="s2">have i failed and i had resentment</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">because i was working with other people</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.719" end="01:11:31.360" style="s2">having that pure confidence on my own is</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.600" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">super difficult</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.360" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">i think wow and and you know andrew even</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:39.520" style="s2">as you&#39;re sharing that i can feel</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:40.239" style="s2">the emotional reality that you&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.520" end="01:11:43.840" style="s2">through something</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.239" end="01:11:44.480" style="s2">painful and that it unpacks into even</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.840" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.480" end="01:11:48.960" style="s2">trauma in a sense where you feel</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:50.480" style="s2">betrayed or something by other people or</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.960" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">let down</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.480" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">and literally that kind of emotional</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s showing up into your</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:12:01.040" style="s2">entrepreneurial world</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.840" end="01:12:04.640" style="s2">is hindering your progress</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.040" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">oh yeah and so you know the bioemotive</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.640" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">framework gives you tools just finding</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">the core feelings</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:14.480" style="s2">sitting with it saying i feel alone</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.480" end="01:12:15.679" style="s2">find the interpersonal feelings like i</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:19.440" style="s2">feel abandoned</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.679" end="01:12:21.920" style="s2">or i feel betrayed and cry about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow your emotional system to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.920" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">update</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.960" end="01:12:29.280" style="s2">and meet the reality that your intellect</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:31.280" style="s2">knows to be true but that your emotional</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.280" end="01:12:32.239" style="s2">system can&#39;t access right now and once</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.280" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.239" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll feel a shift and you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:39.440" style="s2">feel the aloneness in the same way and</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">the betrayal and abandonment won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.440" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">be there and you&#39;ll be able to step into</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.760" end="01:12:46.080" style="s2">new opportunities without that fear and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.000" end="01:12:49.440" style="s2">ptsd type</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.080" end="01:12:51.920" style="s2">encounter and probably learn to trust</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.440" end="01:12:53.360" style="s2">people and embrace potential partners</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.920" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">that are showing up</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.360" end="01:12:57.280" style="s2">but you unconsciously turn away from</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.440" end="01:13:00.400" style="s2">because of this issue of</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.280" end="01:13:00.400" style="s2">being alone and betrayed</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.760" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">so i&#39;m speaking with general er general</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">rarity</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">but i&#39;m seeing some of it resonating so</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:11.120" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping that you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">spend some time processing that on your</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.120" end="01:13:14.640" style="s2">own oh yeah i&#39;m working with a therapist</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.440" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.640" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">uh that&#39;s definitely themes that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">coming in and that&#39;s how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:21.679" style="s2">like that&#39;s how i&#39;m not like breaking</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:24.800" style="s2">out in tears right now</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.679" end="01:13:26.400" style="s2">but like yeah yeah awesome well waited</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.800" end="01:13:28.960" style="s2">way to go andrew i admire</p>

<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:38.719" style="s2">some feelings that came up or surprised</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.840" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">them or that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.719" end="01:13:47.199" style="s2">you know had an interesting insight on</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">i wanted to share sure</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.199" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure how coherent it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:56.320" style="s2">when it gets translated to words</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:58.480" style="s2">um well i&#39;ll pause you there the whole</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.320" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">point of the bible motive framework is</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.480" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">nadura</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:03.280" style="s2">teaches you that it&#39;s not easy to put</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:05.920" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.280" end="01:14:07.280" style="s2">to these feelings but there&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.920" end="01:14:09.920" style="s2">for doing it</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.280" end="01:14:11.760" style="s2">and when you do it feels really good so</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.920" end="01:14:13.120" style="s2">if you stumble around it means you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.760" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2">a leading edge</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.120" end="01:14:17.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s an important thing so take your</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">time to find the words</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.040" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">and check for the resonance as you speak</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">you know follow the energy</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.120" end="01:14:31.360" style="s2">the the feeling that&#39;s coming to mind is</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.719" end="01:14:33.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a quote by jiddu krishnamurthy</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.360" end="01:14:33.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.679" end="01:14:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not a sign of good health to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">adjusted to a profoundly sick society</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.640" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">and i have this feeling sometimes when</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:00.400" style="s2">the systems that we have here it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.640" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">humans are meant to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.400" end="01:15:03.920" style="s2">relationships they&#39;re about reciprocity</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.920" end="01:15:07.120" style="s2">um supposed to be close and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:09.199" style="s2">these are artificial</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.120" end="01:15:10.239" style="s2">these relationships over distance and</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.199" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">these caricatures</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.239" end="01:15:14.719" style="s2">that based off marketing and so i wonder</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.199" end="01:15:17.760" style="s2">if one of the strengths</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:21.199" style="s2">of this work is</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.760" end="01:15:24.480" style="s2">in learning your personal</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.199" end="01:15:27.280" style="s2">feelings that you&#39;re avoiding and</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.480" end="01:15:28.880" style="s2">having more consciousness about that</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.280" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">does that allow you to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.880" end="01:15:34.480" style="s2">more independence in recognizing these</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.560" end="01:15:35.760" style="s2">things about the kind of sickness of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.480" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.760" end="01:15:39.520" style="s2">like i feel like if um if i could share</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:43.120" style="s2">what an example</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.520" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">like when it comes to raising money</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.120" end="01:15:46.239" style="s2">it almost feels like it&#39;s hard to make</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.600" end="01:15:48.880" style="s2">comments</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.239" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">about molok like the actual act of</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.880" end="01:15:52.159" style="s2">raising money</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">causes so many of the problems because</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.159" end="01:15:54.880" style="s2">you feel like you have to promise growth</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:56.239" style="s2">you feel like you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.880" end="01:15:57.920" style="s2">say we&#39;re going to be this big we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.239" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">going to do all of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.920" end="01:16:04.320" style="s2">um and it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.600" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to talk about that when in</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.320" end="01:16:07.440" style="s2">undoubtedly there&#39;s all these feelings</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:10.640" style="s2">about rejection</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.440" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">and fear um</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.640" end="01:16:15.360" style="s2">so i&#39;m just curious like whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:18.560" style="s2">maybe one of the main benefits</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.360" end="01:16:21.600" style="s2">of this work is you can actually realize</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.560" end="01:16:24.719" style="s2">what&#39;s externally up um well</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.600" end="01:16:28.159" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna give you an edge</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.719" end="01:16:31.040" style="s2">you probably don&#39;t like um</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.159" end="01:16:32.400" style="s2">but if it doesn&#39;t fit or give you any</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.040" end="01:16:36.159" style="s2">insights then you can just</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.400" end="01:16:39.760" style="s2">let it go part of what i hear</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.159" end="01:16:40.000" style="s2">um you is i&#39;m hearing a i think a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.760" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.000" end="01:16:45.600" style="s2">trauma-based bias of a vision for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:48.800" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.600" end="01:16:50.560" style="s2">and like right now we&#39;re very much in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.800" end="01:16:53.840" style="s2">modernist</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.560" end="01:16:56.960" style="s2">developmental stage as a culture we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.840" end="01:16:59.199" style="s2">grown out of traditional as a main</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">stay but there&#39;s a lot of people there</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.199" end="01:17:02.480" style="s2">and we&#39;ve certainly</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">gone out of for the most part the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.480" end="01:17:06.239" style="s2">dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:08.080" style="s2">ideally we would all be at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.239" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">postmodern stage that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.080" end="01:17:13.679" style="s2">about but that takes time to get there</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:16.080" style="s2">the modern stage that you&#39;re i think</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.679" end="01:17:16.400" style="s2">having a lot of negative associations to</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.080" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:22.640" style="s2">actually brought a lot of um</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:23.760" style="s2">people out of poverty and improved the</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.640" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">standard of living</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.760" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">for many many beings around the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">and you can&#39;t you know and until they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:36.719" style="s2">got those basic survival needs and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:39.040" style="s2">dynamics in place it&#39;s hard to relate</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.719" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">to a lot of these higher order</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.040" end="01:17:43.280" style="s2">dimensions of</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:46.000" style="s2">the quality of life and relationship</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.280" end="01:17:48.760" style="s2">even though it was there in the past it</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.000" end="01:17:52.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the technological</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.760" end="01:17:56.640" style="s2">sophistication and and um</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.880" end="01:17:59.120" style="s2">uh opportunities and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.640" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">perks that we have now in in the modern</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.120" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:06.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:08.400" style="s2">strengths and weaknesses to each stage</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.400" end="01:18:10.320" style="s2">but integral theory says that we all</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.400" end="01:18:10.960" style="s2">have to move through the stages and we</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.320" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">just need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.960" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">try and be as healthy as we can</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:20.880" style="s2">um your</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.840" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">feelings about raising money and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.880" end="01:18:25.760" style="s2">fear of rejection</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">um it may be that you haven&#39;t found your</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.760" end="01:18:28.960" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:30.400" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying to sell to the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.960" end="01:18:33.120" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.400" end="01:18:34.800" style="s2">if you look at marketing closely and</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.120" end="01:18:37.840" style="s2">this is something i admire</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:40.000" style="s2">todd hargrave for he very much pushes</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.840" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">point of view marketing which is really</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.000" end="01:18:45.360" style="s2">where you share some of your deeper</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">perspectives on how the world works and</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.360" end="01:18:49.840" style="s2">what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:51.360" style="s2">and those people come to you and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.840" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">marketing becomes</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.360" end="01:18:55.600" style="s2">a relational dynamic if you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:57.520" style="s2">your truth</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">in a way that honors you and your</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.520" end="01:19:02.000" style="s2">potential tribe</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">they will hear you and resonate with you</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.000" end="01:19:05.600" style="s2">and they will be just as enthusiastic as</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:08.960" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.600" end="01:19:13.199" style="s2">by your projects but if you&#39;re pitching</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.960" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">your um idea and vision to the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.199" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">people the wrong developmental stage or</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:19.360" style="s2">in the wrong context you&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:21.360" style="s2">to get discord and friction</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.360" end="01:19:23.280" style="s2">so you kind of have to ask yourself why</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.360" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">you&#39;re in that situation and</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.280" end="01:19:27.360" style="s2">why you&#39;re not looking for a different</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:28.159" style="s2">tribe or a set of funders because i know</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.360" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">they exist</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.159" end="01:19:32.400" style="s2">like we&#39;re a class b corporation and</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:34.400" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of people who have</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.400" end="01:19:35.600" style="s2">those values that are also looking to</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.400" end="01:19:37.440" style="s2">invest money</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.600" end="01:19:39.280" style="s2">in places where they can make the world</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.440" end="01:19:42.400" style="s2">a better place</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.280" end="01:19:43.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot there and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.400" end="01:19:45.120" style="s2">if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.280" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">i&#39;m even going to leave you time to</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.120" end="01:19:49.920" style="s2">respond because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:50.480" style="s2">um there but if you want to just say you</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.920" end="01:19:52.719" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.480" end="01:19:54.080" style="s2">one or two things then we&#39;ll move on and</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.719" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">hopefully some of what i&#39;ve said was</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.080" end="01:19:57.280" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">uh before you jump in anjon i just want</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.280" end="01:20:00.640" style="s2">to flake that we have seven minutes</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:04.239" style="s2">uh and then another session starts we</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.640" end="01:20:07.120" style="s2">might get kicked out of this one</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.239" end="01:20:07.679" style="s2">i&#39;ll try to be quick then doug um so a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.120" end="01:20:09.840" style="s2">lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.679" end="01:20:11.840" style="s2">stuff we talk about at the stoa is this</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.840" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">the world today&#39;s got this particular</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:16.000" style="s2">game theory</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">game a and it&#39;s kind of a downward</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.000" end="01:20:21.199" style="s2">spiral in so many ways what malloc</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:22.239" style="s2">is and it doesn&#39;t need to be that way if</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.199" end="01:20:24.400" style="s2">the operating system</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.239" end="01:20:26.880" style="s2">for society could be different there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.400" end="01:20:30.320" style="s2">potentially ways to align interest have</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.880" end="01:20:32.000" style="s2">an upward spiral game b and i think what</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.320" end="01:20:34.719" style="s2">i&#39;m reacting to is this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.000" end="01:20:36.880" style="s2">like all of these engagements does have</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.719" end="01:20:39.600" style="s2">so many personal feelings</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.880" end="01:20:40.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s like so much is lost if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.600" end="01:20:42.639" style="s2">if you&#39;re only going to focus</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.800" end="01:20:44.080" style="s2">on the personal feelings and not see the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.639" end="01:20:46.800" style="s2">methods of fundraising</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.080" end="01:20:47.679" style="s2">cause so many misincentives like in</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.800" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">silicon valley</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.679" end="01:20:51.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of good people but they do</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.400" end="01:20:53.040" style="s2">all these weird things because of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.679" end="01:20:53.840" style="s2">way they raise money and things like</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.040" end="01:20:57.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.840" end="01:20:58.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m just trying to it feels like it</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.120" end="01:21:01.520" style="s2">would be a loss to just</p>

<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:09.280" style="s2">the messed upness of these systems</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.600" end="01:21:17.120" style="s2">there is a a reason</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.440" end="01:21:19.760" style="s2">why they are the way they are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.120" end="01:21:22.480" style="s2">very complex factors and systems and</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.400" end="01:21:42.320" style="s2">a dysfunctional part of our culture and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.800" end="01:21:44.639" style="s2">do a lot of reading</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.320" end="01:21:46.639" style="s2">and spending time talking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.639" end="01:21:48.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not dedicating a part of their</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.639" end="01:21:51.440" style="s2">life to fixing it</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.480" end="01:21:52.400" style="s2">you&#39;re probably just hurting yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.440" end="01:21:54.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.400" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">that that there&#39;s a focus that that</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.480" end="01:21:58.080" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re just aggravating ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.080" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">like i stopped paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:03.760" style="s2">certain types of dysfunction in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:06.320" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.760" end="01:22:07.280" style="s2">because it became really clear in my</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.320" end="01:22:09.120" style="s2">mind that</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:10.320" style="s2">you know it had been corrupted in many</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.120" end="01:22:13.120" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.320" end="01:22:14.400" style="s2">but me just seeing that over and over</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.120" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">and over just hurt</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.400" end="01:22:18.080" style="s2">unless i was willing to spend some time</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:19.199" style="s2">trying to do something and start</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.080" end="01:22:21.280" style="s2">lobbying and</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.199" end="01:22:23.040" style="s2">you know and i only have so much power</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:24.960" style="s2">and energy and attention</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.040" end="01:22:26.560" style="s2">i had to just drop it and go well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.960" end="01:22:28.239" style="s2">just the way it is and i&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.560" end="01:22:30.320" style="s2">other people are looking after that</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.239" end="01:22:32.000" style="s2">right now you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.320" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">one of the other things that i like</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.000" end="01:22:38.639" style="s2">about the interpretation of the word</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">dharma is it means the way things are</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.639" end="01:22:43.040" style="s2">and if you if you want to reduce</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:47.280" style="s2">suffering you need to like</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.040" end="01:22:49.920" style="s2">really acknowledge the way things are</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.280" end="01:22:50.560" style="s2">do what you can to change them but also</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.920" end="01:22:53.360" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.560" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">how big or little of an impact you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.360" end="01:22:57.440" style="s2">have on it</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:22:59.120" style="s2">and and just come to peace with the fact</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.440" end="01:23:02.159" style="s2">that these are really big</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.120" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">systems that will take more than usually</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.159" end="01:23:07.520" style="s2">more than one individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">energy to change their systemic forces</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.520" end="01:23:12.560" style="s2">that will take</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:16.080" style="s2">usually decades not days or years</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.560" end="01:23:17.679" style="s2">to to grow and once you realize that and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.080" end="01:23:19.120" style="s2">make peace with it</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.679" end="01:23:20.719" style="s2">you know life gets gets a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.120" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">easier and you find ways to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.719" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">successful in</p>

<p begin="01:24:34.400" end="01:24:39.520" style="s2">different approach to understanding some</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.320" end="01:24:42.080" style="s2">of the blocks you face as entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.520" end="01:24:44.480" style="s2">my experience is that the more aware we</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.080" end="01:24:46.639" style="s2">are of our emotional realities</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.480" end="01:24:47.840" style="s2">and the more conscious we are about</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.639" end="01:24:50.719" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:51.120" style="s2">our feelings and our lived experiences</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.719" end="01:24:53.440" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="01:24:53.440" end="01:24:57.199" style="s2">life becomes</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.800" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">and it also helps a lot with our</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.199" end="01:25:02.000" style="s2">developmental stages</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">and the entrepreneurial path that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.000" end="01:25:05.520" style="s2">chosen</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">is a very powerful path because if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.520" end="01:25:09.440" style="s2">continue it</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:10.159" style="s2">you will just keep bumping up against</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.440" end="01:25:13.120" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.159" end="01:25:14.159" style="s2">feelings of inadequacy and all the other</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.120" end="01:25:15.760" style="s2">feelings that</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.159" end="01:25:17.679" style="s2">you need to work on because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.760" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">probably not true but you&#39;ve been living</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.679" end="01:25:22.080" style="s2">with them a long time</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:25.440" style="s2">and they feel true to you you know and</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.080" end="01:25:26.639" style="s2">uh if you do the work and keep pushing</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.440" end="01:25:29.920" style="s2">towards your goal</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.639" end="01:25:31.679" style="s2">you will be successful even if it means</p>
