<p begin="00:00:01.820" end="00:00:08.220" style="s2">welcome this is a short video to answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.339" end="00:00:12.740" style="s2">the question that David sweat Lowe posed</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.220" end="00:00:14.549" style="s2">to me on the recent Q&amp;A and</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.740" end="00:00:16.949" style="s2">unfortunately for a technological</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.549" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">problem technology is the God that limps</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.949" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">we were suddenly cast out of the techno</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:25.550" style="s2">sphere and I&#39;d like to now take this</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">opportunity to answer David&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.550" end="00:00:29.369" style="s2">David&#39;s question again to remind</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">everyone is participatory knowing seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.369" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">the hardest lens to pull away and look</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">at rather than through but this seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">essential perhaps shamanic practices do</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">this thoughts are clarification on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">and I began by saying that I think this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:42.660" style="s2">is a really important question and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">the connection to shamanism is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.660" end="00:00:48.539" style="s2">that we should talk about I went into</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:54.030" style="s2">the idea of participatory knowing as</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.539" end="00:00:58.770" style="s2">this mutual shaping between an organism</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">and its environment and I used Vic in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.770" end="00:01:03.559" style="s2">Stein&#39;s famous phrase enigmatic like</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">many things that the kitchen tine says</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.559" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">you know even if lions could speak we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:09.799" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t understand them and he means</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">you know utters syntactically correct</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.799" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">sentences etc and why is that well</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea through what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">niche constructions you know organisms</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">act in their environment and that shapes</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">and changes the environment which then</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">through natural selection shapes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">organism they mutually shape each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">so that they come to be fitted so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">affordances are generated between the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">organism and the environment such that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">an agent arena relationship is possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">so because of my evolutionary history I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">am shaped with this kind of Dexter</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">dexterity and so this becomes you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:52.340" style="s2">graspable and manipulative well by me in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">a way that a dog can&#39;t do for example so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.340" end="00:01:57.060" style="s2">because of that biological niche</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.130" style="s2">construction that biological mutual</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">shaping lines have a different form of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.130" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">life within us so that coupling and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">set of affordances that it opens up of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:10.020" style="s2">course then skews the salience</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">landscaping of the prospective annoying</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.020" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">and their situational awareness is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">there in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:18.209" style="s2">in a fundamental sense very different</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:21.540" style="s2">from mine so in that sense I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.209" end="00:02:23.909" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to be a lion and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.540" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">means there that&#39;s so their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.909" end="00:02:27.500" style="s2">on knowing is different and then that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">means of course given that that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.500" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">shifting or skewing of their situational</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">awareness the skills they can acquire</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:35.909" style="s2">and the skills they can apply are very</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">different from mine so their procedural</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.909" end="00:02:40.409" style="s2">knowing is different and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:43.620" style="s2">then were able to talk propositional you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.409" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2">know speech on top of that right I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.620" end="00:02:47.430" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t make any sense of it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.390" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">that the sense of propositions would not</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.430" end="00:02:51.180" style="s2">connect to my procedural knowing to my</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:52.859" style="s2">prospective table knowing down to my</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.180" end="00:02:55.079" style="s2">participatory in the knowing so even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.859" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">Lions could speak I wouldn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.079" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">them victims don&#39;t call this a form of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:00.870" style="s2">life now the point I want to make is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.459" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">that of course we are different than</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:04.200" style="s2">lions in that we don&#39;t just have</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">biological mutual shaping we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">cultural mutual shaping and that fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">that&#39;s what culture is culture is this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:14.549" style="s2">you know organization of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">cognition and meaning systems and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.549" end="00:03:21.449" style="s2">behavior such that the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:24.269" style="s2">the and the agent are being mutually</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.449" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">shaped to each other so I I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.269" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">particular culture in Canada and notice</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">the environment has been shaped around</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:32.940" style="s2">me this way and I&#39;m shaped in certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">ways both in my behavior the clothing I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.940" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">wear etc so culture is also this mutual</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.889" style="s2">shaping that creates all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">affordances that&#39;s why you when you go</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.889" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">to a culture that is foreign to you you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:47.480" style="s2">experience culture shock not because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have you know sort of biological</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.480" end="00:03:52.739" style="s2">fitness to the environment but because</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">that mutual shaping between you and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.739" end="00:03:59.099" style="s2">environment that is done by culture is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">not available to you so you can lock</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.099" end="00:04:05.239" style="s2">that kind of participatory knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:08.699" style="s2">then of course on top of that you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.239" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">cognitive mutual shaping in which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.699" end="00:04:10.709" style="s2">know your relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">machinery</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.709" end="00:04:16.409" style="s2">you know below the level of your ego</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:19.289" style="s2">awareness is shaping your processing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.409" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a specializing the environment so</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.289" end="00:04:24.020" style="s2">that it fits to you so things come up to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">you in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.020" end="00:04:29.150" style="s2">cognitively so and I&#39;ve course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:31.400" style="s2">presenting these analytically and within</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.150" end="00:04:33.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s for purposes of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.400" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">but of course the biological the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.050" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">cultural and the cognitive are all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:39.139" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:41.389" style="s2">mutually interpenetrating and affording</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.139" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">each other and I try to when I talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.389" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">about participatory knowing I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:47.479" style="s2">about invoking all of that now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.740" end="00:04:50.150" style="s2">interesting about shamanism is I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.479" end="00:04:52.699" style="s2">shamanism and this is I think why David</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.150" end="00:04:54.669" style="s2">brought it up shamanism is very much an</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.699" end="00:04:57.050" style="s2">attempt</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.669" end="00:05:00.110" style="s2">sorry attempt sounds too weak it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.050" end="00:05:02.569" style="s2">much a practice that what it&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">this of course because of the and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.569" end="00:05:06.979" style="s2">goes back to a question I answer the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:11.000" style="s2">about mimesis because the shaman for</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.979" end="00:05:14.360" style="s2">example is right in acting the dear the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.000" end="00:05:16.789" style="s2">shaman is trying to use his or her</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.360" end="00:05:19.099" style="s2">altered state of consciousness which has</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.789" end="00:05:21.979" style="s2">loosened up their salience landscape so</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.099" end="00:05:25.669" style="s2">that they can get closer to what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.979" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">like to see things to the way a deer</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.669" end="00:05:29.750" style="s2">does to salience landscape the way a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:31.310" style="s2">deer does and then what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.750" end="00:05:33.650" style="s2">they&#39;re actually trying to move their</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.310" end="00:05:36.949" style="s2">body and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.650" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2">a-a-a and enact it through sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.949" end="00:05:41.509" style="s2">inactive transformation even get down to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">sort of transforming a bit the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.509" end="00:05:45.050" style="s2">biological niche construction what what</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:49.389" style="s2">kind of body and that&#39;s why you wear the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.050" end="00:05:51.979" style="s2">mask and they sort of hunker down and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.389" end="00:05:53.810" style="s2">move in certain ways so what did what</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.979" end="00:05:56.539" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is the shaman is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.810" end="00:05:59.240" style="s2">trying to alter consciousness trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.539" end="00:06:02.300" style="s2">alter sort their their their their</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.240" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">biological their biology in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.300" end="00:06:09.949" style="s2">their behavior and even there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:12.469" style="s2">a morphology and of course trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.949" end="00:06:15.560" style="s2">know pick up on certain skills that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.469" end="00:06:19.969" style="s2">deer might have and I think what those</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:23.330" style="s2">practices do is they really do give you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.969" end="00:06:26.060" style="s2">a sense of participatory knowing insofar</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.330" end="00:06:30.590" style="s2">as you can move between them if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.060" end="00:06:33.050" style="s2">allow me world to mean agent arena cocoa</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.590" end="00:06:35.849" style="s2">configuration right as the shaman moves</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.050" end="00:06:38.729" style="s2">between the human world</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.849" end="00:06:41.789" style="s2">and the sacred world of the animals for</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.729" end="00:06:45.119" style="s2">example that a capacity to move between</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.789" end="00:06:47.699" style="s2">them is going to bring to awareness as</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.119" end="00:06:51.270" style="s2">David said the normally transparent lens</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.699" end="00:06:53.009" style="s2">of our participatory knowing it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.270" end="00:06:56.999" style="s2">interesting that how this comes up I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.009" end="00:06:58.889" style="s2">gave a talk recently a ute ism about and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.999" end="00:07:00.209" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned this before about you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.889" end="00:07:02.699" style="s2">know with the scientists working with</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.209" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">the Rovers on Mars and you can see them</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.699" end="00:07:07.009" style="s2">sort of having to create this nice</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.520" end="00:07:09.569" style="s2">construction they said they</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.009" end="00:07:11.429" style="s2">anthropomorphize the rover and they sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.569" end="00:07:13.469" style="s2">of techni morph eyes themselves like for</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.429" end="00:07:15.629" style="s2">safety talk talks about so they&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.469" end="00:07:17.429" style="s2">about the rover to say like I or we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.629" end="00:07:19.499" style="s2">to go there but they&#39;ll also say you</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.429" end="00:07:21.389" style="s2">know they&#39;ll enact being the rover they</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.499" end="00:07:23.399" style="s2">put their hands up like camera like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.389" end="00:07:26.039" style="s2">and they move a rep how I need to turn</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.399" end="00:07:28.769" style="s2">right and so they they do this mutual</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.039" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">shaping because they also shape the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.769" end="00:07:32.459" style="s2">photos that they&#39;re getting they draw on</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:34.740" style="s2">them and they they alter the Stallions</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.459" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">patterns so they shape themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.740" end="00:07:40.139" style="s2">they sort of specialize and identify</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">with the rover and they shape the photos</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.139" end="00:07:43.579" style="s2">that the rover sending back because</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:45.479" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to create that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.579" end="00:07:48.389" style="s2">participatory knowing so they get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.479" end="00:07:50.699" style="s2">sense of being on Mars because when they</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.389" end="00:07:52.499" style="s2">can get that sense of being on Mars then</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.699" end="00:07:54.659" style="s2">they can do the best fieldwork on Mars</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.499" end="00:07:58.589" style="s2">they can train and apply the best set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.659" end="00:08:01.619" style="s2">skills so it&#39;s you can see rocket</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.589" end="00:08:04.949" style="s2">scientists behaving in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.619" end="00:08:07.019" style="s2">kind of like the shamans they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.949" end="00:08:09.839" style="s2">things like you know I was working in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.019" end="00:08:12.689" style="s2">garden in my right hand got stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.839" end="00:08:14.550" style="s2">when I got to the lab the Rovers right</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.689" end="00:08:16.649" style="s2">front wheel with stock and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.550" end="00:08:19.259" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in magic but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.649" end="00:08:22.139" style="s2">kind of connection you know that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.259" end="00:08:26.249" style="s2">sounds very much like they&#39;re exacting</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.139" end="00:08:29.459" style="s2">that shamanic machinery with it I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.249" end="00:08:31.829" style="s2">we do have not Rossano argues for this</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.459" end="00:08:35.009" style="s2">in Supernatural selection that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.829" end="00:08:36.689" style="s2">probably shamanism has probably been</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.009" end="00:08:39.539" style="s2">around since the Upper Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.689" end="00:08:41.969" style="s2">transition and was a set of psycho tips</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.539" end="00:08:45.059" style="s2">a psycho technological practices that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.969" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">exalted our capacity for altering our</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.059" end="00:08:48.740" style="s2">state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:50.860" style="s2">of respectable and our participatory</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.740" end="00:08:53.930" style="s2">knowing as I&#39;ve just described and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.860" end="00:08:55.340" style="s2">that&#39;s been around long enough and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.930" end="00:08:57.770" style="s2">there might have been been something</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.340" end="00:09:00.830" style="s2">like a Baldwin effect that those</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.770" end="00:09:02.960" style="s2">individuals would enhance the group that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.830" end="00:09:04.700" style="s2">they belong to surviving much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.960" end="00:09:10.790" style="s2">likely for those kinds of integrals will</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.700" end="00:09:13.960" style="s2">be to reproduce etc and that sort of we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.790" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">might be genetically disposed towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.960" end="00:09:18.710" style="s2">shamanism this is one explanation why we</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:24.430" style="s2">seem to have something like the placebo</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.710" end="00:09:30.140" style="s2">effect why we seem to be hypnotizable</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.430" end="00:09:32.420" style="s2">things like that so I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.140" end="00:09:36.760" style="s2">suggesting to you is we have these</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:39.230" style="s2">capacities from our shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.760" end="00:09:41.900" style="s2">heritage if you&#39;ll allow me that turn of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.230" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">phrase that can get exact it even by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.900" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">scientists who are doing this having to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:51.650" style="s2">confront this very new and bizarre way</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">of doing their science and so that shows</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.650" end="00:09:59.990" style="s2">me that I think there is something I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">think David&#39;s question is really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.990" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">powerful on how it points to the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:11.870" style="s2">shamanism gives us access to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:15.890" style="s2">aware much more better more aware of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.870" end="00:10:17.950" style="s2">participatory knowing and yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.890" end="00:10:20.470" style="s2">nevertheless how you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.950" end="00:10:22.970" style="s2">spontaneously come or something at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.470" end="00:10:24.410" style="s2">that&#39;s been exempted in an analogous</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.970" end="00:10:26.510" style="s2">fashion you can see it in the work of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.410" end="00:10:28.820" style="s2">sort of literal cutting the you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.510" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">cutting edge literal rocket scientists</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.820" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">working with some of our hyper</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:39.050" style="s2">technology on Mars and and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:40.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a really great question and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.050" end="00:10:43.160" style="s2">glad I got this opportunity if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.760" end="00:10:45.740" style="s2">answer it more fully so thank you David</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.160" end="00:10:48.470" style="s2">very much for it and thank thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.740" end="00:10:50.089" style="s2">those who tuned in to my Q&amp;A we got cut</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.470" end="00:10:51.620" style="s2">off before I could thank you all thank</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.089" end="00:10:54.529" style="s2">you all so very much</p>
