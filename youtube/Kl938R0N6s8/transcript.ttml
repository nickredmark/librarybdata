<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:09.679" style="s2">discord q a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.080" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">this is part three of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.679" end="00:00:16.880" style="s2">trilogy through nick b&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:20.960" style="s2">journey or his tale of intrigue</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">and through his life in four cults</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">and uh he&#39;s taken us through</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">uh quite a bit and now today we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">to be focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">i guess the the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">of how to how how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:37.520" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna have a cult how to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:39.920" style="s2">a good call</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.920" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll pass it uh i&#39;ll pass it to you in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:47.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">great yeah so we ran through a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.200" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">a couple of these uh tenets at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:55.039" style="s2">of the last video</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">um and perhaps we can just kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.039" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">through them as they come up</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">instead of listing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">kind of like i did last time as i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">rushing</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">i maybe a good starting point would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.920" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">arguably the two traits that come up</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">most obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">when we think of the word cult kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">its popular image</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:27.439" style="s2">within the culture and that&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.439" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">and authoritarianism um</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">so those are like the the big you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">the boogeyman word of cult it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">generally you&#39;re thinking of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:42.880" style="s2">extraordinarily narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">leader that has an extreme authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.880" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">rule</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">over the group of people that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">convinced of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">so part of you know when i make</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:02:00.320" style="s2">arguments in in this realm has been you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">know part of my argument against why</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.320" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">cult is not a particularly useful word</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">is because a lot of really good work has</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">been done</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">on these uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:16.239" style="s2">qualities in other fields</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">and everything you can learn from those</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">applies directly to these larger group</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">situations or</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:27.599" style="s2">even small just group situations</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">um and so i don&#39;t think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.599" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">doing very much to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">cult as a normative boundary in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">instead it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot more useful for</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">a person</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">to move the normative boundary to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">descriptor</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">so right oh this is a narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">cultic structure can give someone more</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">because they know what narcissism is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">whereas the word cult is too</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">fuzzy and kicks in someone&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">defensive reactions perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">um so it in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">a book that i found very useful um</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">was was daniel shaw&#39;s traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">um and then it&#39;s i forget the subtitle</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">systems of subjugation or something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">um but he he gives an interesting frame</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">because he kind of stacks it</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">he starts from an individual personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">layer of dealing with narcissism and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">narcissistic parents or</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">close people in the in your family and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">then he kind of builds it up from there</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">looking at at how that narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">quality can develop</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">into these larger systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">and one of the chapters is devoted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">his time</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">in a cult that was based in hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">although he never actually says which</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">one it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">so yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">really tricky a really tricky aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">scenario as well because narcissism has</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">so wildly out of control like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">the normal mode of behavior now</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">to be extraordinarily narcissistic like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">social media is it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">fosters extreme narcissism it just in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">in the sense of attention seeking and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">distorted sense that forms when you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">a a system where you have a a um</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">an audience and a uh a performer</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">right that scenario leads very deeply to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">uh seeking a lot of this also comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">from the mechanism by which we validate</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">our identities</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">so like narcissism is also a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">quality of what it means to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">so learning kind of like how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">properly contextualize narcissism why it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">and then how it can go kind of sliding</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">you know the familiar nasty territory</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">um all of that is is very important to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">get a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">um and again i would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">probably now more so than ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">because of its extreme prevalence but</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s you know being an instagram or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">youtube star</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">or whatever like all of this is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">uh the beginnings of just classic</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">narcissistic cultic structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">forming around individuals and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">often in ways that we&#39;re not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">familiar with because we&#39;re also used to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">with the word cults or you know a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">thought leader or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">we&#39;re often used to the isolationist</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">quality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">easy to point out in the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">and really hard to point out</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">in the digital world um hard because</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">generally um people will self enclose in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">right echo chamber or kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">bubble</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">it&#39;s usually completely open to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">that wants to go and look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">happening there</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">like there&#39;s very little boundaries most</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">of the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it&#39;s missing a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">qualities that normally set off our red</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">flags</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">uh right even even this group uh not</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">be too harsh here but right one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">barriers of entry is having watched</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">50 hours of one guy&#39;s lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">granted you can come in and have</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">conversations without that but</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">it will be reinforced by the people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">if you want to deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">partake in the conversations we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">having here that&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">a standard requirement</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s going you know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">potential for for that type of thing to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">start forming into uh personality cults</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">is is very easy and you see it with</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">you know jordan peterson or i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">i&#39;m picking certain people here but that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">people would be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s possible with</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">anybody nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">uh but i&#39;m wondering a bit here</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">learn about narcissism is the main point</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">there and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">that learning is very useful because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">applies in every social circumstance in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">which you&#39;ll encounter it</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">uh rather than than trying to use a lens</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">helpful of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">do the normative boundary uh policing</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">of what is a cult and what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">so that was a nice 10 minute rant</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if anyone has comments on</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">uh i i have a comment</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">so i do agree with you on narcissism as</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">the cult kind of the standard cult</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">understanding what my experience was</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">that i i i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">in my experience with the cult like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">mo</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">the destructive one i&#39;ve been in i</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">there are people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">overt narcissists but also there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">kind of convert narcissists like</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">or or they are so traumatized that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">are like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">trauma bonding or whatever the term is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">but right essentially like it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">kind of stable system</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">in a way and also the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">some of the people who are not alert</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">narcissists</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">they are actually kind of aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">become like the next leader</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">of some sort that&#39;s my kind of i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">prove it but it was my feeling does it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">matter yes and i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">getting like a clear handle on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">uh the work that&#39;s been not</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">done on narcissism is helpful because it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">pops us out of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">our classic training you know the really</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">overt</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">signs of narcissism that most people can</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">and it gets a lot more refined and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">one of the comments perhaps to your</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">point that i said</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">in i think in the last one was about</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">how naivety is a form of narciss</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">like most of what fuels naivety</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">is narcissism and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.279" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">having this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">there yeah you&#39;re exactly right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:30.079" style="s2">a very bizarre effect where our own</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">sense of narcissism makes us way more</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">likely to be manipulated by another</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">because in some sense we are realizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">our dream through the that person we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">projecting it and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">subjugate ourselves with the dream that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">will be the mighty</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">narcissist at some later point</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">um so that yeah maybe our own narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">can work against us in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">ways in that regard one is is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">projecting on to the person what we want</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">and then the other is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">opening us up to levels of manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">that you would not</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">necessarily uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">be as open to without a culture-wide</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">emphasis on uh narcissistic behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">and following up on this i have this</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">observation that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">the cults have this kind of i mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">narcissistic cults as you call them</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">they have this weird usefulness</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">because a person can go on</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">being manipulated for whatever or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">aware delusional</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">narcissistic whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">it until they actually hit</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">a more sophisticated narcissist which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">usually a cult leader</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">and then they hit the wall</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">and this becomes kind of a realization</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">in a way</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">right but sometimes sometimes it turns</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">badly but sometimes it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">awakening moment</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">in a way oh and they they start to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">their own nursing field</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">so in this respect it&#39;s kind of weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">right i mean that&#39;s a it&#39;s a important</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.680" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">point to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">right it&#39;s like just because a system is</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">is uh relatively horrifying does not</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">mean people are not</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">learning a great deal from it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">um and you know part of that confusion</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">can be used against uh well it can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">used within</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">a cultic structure um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">so you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">there&#39;s always learning to be had from</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.360" style="s2">bad circumstances we happen to find</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">um okay but we should ideally if</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">if we&#39;re consciously going into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:01.839" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">like in this group where people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.839" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">trying to design a religion</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">i think it would it&#39;s probably helpful</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">to have a very clear idea of how very</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">wrong those things can go</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">yeah also your good intentions don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">protect you from</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">anything at all right every cult i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">been in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">had but legitimately honestly good</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">intentions</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">um so yeah that&#39;s part of that naivety</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah but that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">like how</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">groups of people do get delusional as</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.519" style="s2">as individuals this is i find that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.519" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">right well what i noticed as well was</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">like a very slow slide</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">um from the means</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">are more important to the ends to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">ends justify the means</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">and it was not obvious where the switch</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">so there&#39;s just this slow</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">movement right especially if your means</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">are not performing as well as you would</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">hope</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">then there&#39;s just this like keep your</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">eye on the prize</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">thing that starts popping up and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">eventually you&#39;ll realize that you start</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">you know you&#39;re willing to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">more and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">uh for the accomplishment of that goal</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">uh until you end up in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">a full you know arguably uh heavily</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">delusional state</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">i have a question so</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">regarding confirmation bias and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">replication crisis in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">um do you think it&#39;s hard to use</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">um psychological theories as concrete</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">as concrete models absolutely i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">they can still be very helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.560" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">training a person&#39;s salience but every</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">time i read</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">especially psychoanalysis which is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">weird-ass branch of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">i take it with a huge grain of salt and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">i try and make use of it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">it you know allow it to inform my own</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">experiences on things but i try not to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:22.639" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the hard sciences are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">easier to let them</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">impact me more than the soft sciences</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">one should be i think deeply skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">just to draw off that when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">about branding</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:36.480" style="s2">and um kind of internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">whatever that brand or identity might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.480" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">i i&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">about with psychology um whatever pop</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">theory might be uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">relevant at the time it might um make</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">your salience landscape</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">identify with whatever is popular in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.360" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">and so something like um like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.360" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">christianity being popular and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">the supernatural model of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.199" style="s2">and you internalize that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">like that&#39;s not going to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.199" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">accurate and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">regarding that i just uh i&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.079" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">sure if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">a good idea to model your salience</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">landscape based on something that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">um exists in any real sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">i would agree however i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">we end up cutting up cutting a balance</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">two dangers one is like you can&#39;t throw</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">all your sense making tools because</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">they&#39;re fuzzy</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">and then at the other end you can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">them too seriously</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">because they are fuzzy well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">pretty broad in general because</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">psychology is just one field of science</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">fully accurate or fully replicable</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">um field yet and so that would be like</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">saying um</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">like oh we can&#39;t throw away</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">christianity&#39;s supernatural claims</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">because they help us make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">i think it&#39;s um misleading</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">i guess yeah um i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">looking at the work in many ways then</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like why listen to what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.039" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">anyone has to say um</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">well if there&#39;s evidence then that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">good start if there&#39;s replication that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">a good start i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">speaking because you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">narcissism which is a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">model in psychology and then psychology</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">like it would be like if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">to scientifically prove</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">astrology for example and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">no evidence and i said well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the best way for us to look</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">at astronomy</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">through the lens of astrology for</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.480" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">so would you say that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.480" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">looking at neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">uh i wouldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t be making any</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">prescriptive claim beyond</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">the claim i just made just because i</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t know like how to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">idea of the cult i&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">fully sure what it what it entails</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">because you&#39;ve brought up the history of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">how the words have changed</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">and so i&#39;m trying to get the general</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">pattern um</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">i guess when you bring up narcissism as</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">the general theme</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">or a general theme uh it becomes even</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">cloudier just because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">theory might not even be accurate to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">human nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">um i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">i agree and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">yet it seems fairly obvious that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2">healthy and unhealthy personality types</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ve classified a certain class of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">under a term that has an arguable basis</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:41.919" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">where it arises from and yet it seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.919" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">fairly obvious when one is interacting</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">with an</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">extreme narcissist that something is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">well i i do i do have uh objections but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to take over</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">the conversation so i&#39;ll allow someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">else to make a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">question or conjecture i can add that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">there is something called</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">dark triad which is more generic term</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">than just narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">and there are scales in experimental</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">psychology how they</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">measure it so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">completely theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">there is some kind of statistical</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">right well and part of the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s statistical evidence</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">so you&#39;re within a field like with</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">psychology you&#39;re largely</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">basing it off of an overton window that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">where it is on a objective scale</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re establishing normal and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">you&#39;re judging things against whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">that idea of normal is</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">right and that&#39;s where the confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">bias comes but anyways i</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">like if anyone else finds this like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">juicy yeah an important point</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">i just don&#39;t want to take over the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">conversation i think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">not a good move to just go all of it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">meaningless make sense no i&#39;m not i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not proven and so to use it as if</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">it was proven is misleading</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">right well and yeah that&#39;s why i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">hedging everything with</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">the um you know take it with a grain of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">salt okay use it fair enough use it to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">help</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">which is where daniel shaw&#39;s writing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">arguably way sketchier than</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">even the larger category of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">okay thanks man</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">but the group sense making of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">does help just yes be skeptical you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">keep a certain layer of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">your autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">uh manuel did you have something i cut</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">you off there</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">at one point oh i i just wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">when when we caught another area</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">right then we might not have the exact</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">area according off but there&#39;s still an</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">area right like if it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">larger or a little bit smaller doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">matter right like we&#39;re still describing</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s important to notice</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">narcissism part right like we might not</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">be accurate but we</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">are accurate enough to talk about a real</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">right well and i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t lose focus that you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.919" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">talking just about narcissism but</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">narcissism with totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">and authoritarianism that you know there</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">are a lot of narcissists out there who</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">you know just impose their will on on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">and yeah right well usually they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">i just i just isolated a narcissism just</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">as a psychological theory</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">right um and it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">it is if you do look into the work a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">like there is it&#39;s not just bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s part of identity formation and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">one right narcissism is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">response to realizing one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">size in the universe i&#39;ve heard one</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">say interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">psychologist right it&#39;s it&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">make it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">in some very deep sense what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">protecting you from nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">um so right</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">again it&#39;s probably a lot more uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">helpful to speak</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">in terms of what does a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">narcissistic attitude look like</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">and what does a unhealthy one look like</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">and authoritarianism might be one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">bring in to look at how narcissism can</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">very damaging</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">when it&#39;s taken out of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">or push too far in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">um all right let&#39;s see are we good on on</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">can we should we bring some other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">in here</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">yep yes please</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">um this one i brought up last time to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">the bait and switch of surrender</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">and uh to submission</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">this one&#39;s exceptionally common for</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">getting people through</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">through the door and kind of altering</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">their normal sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">so right in any type of transformative</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">now we&#39;re looking at a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">subset of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">cultic structures that this</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">group that we&#39;re in is specifically</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">aimed towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">which is how do you transform people um</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">great the word cult also applies to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">political projects and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">many other things but</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">this one is really uh pretty uh tricky</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">because i i think it&#39;s damn near</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">impossible for a person to within</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">identify meaningfully the difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">between surrender and uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">and submission at a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">level um and i can say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">from my own personal experience it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">having an experience of surrender that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">was not oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">any person um</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">that opened me up for being</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">for for confusing it with submission</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">and chasing after the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">surrender</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">through submission which was again i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">relying on a psychoanalyst&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:06.240" style="s2">work here um emmanuel uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">gent g-h-e-n-t</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.240" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">in in some deep sense it&#39;s like upon</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">realizing the deep relaxation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">sleep you smash yourself in the head</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">with a hammer to try and replicate it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">and that obviously has negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">consequences this one&#39;s really tricky</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">and especially because um</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.760" style="s2">part of verveiki&#39;s project in particular</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.760" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">reintroducing the communal</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">aspect of the the kind of transformative</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">project which has largely been stripped</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">in a good number of of the secular</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">projects that have made it into the west</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">that are spiritual in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">right so spirituality in the west has</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">through the new age kind of taken on</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">this tone of like your personal</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">journey and then it falls into this auto</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">didactism</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">that uh verbage critiques rightly</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">and then the problem is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">putting us in back in the dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">of how do you find something that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">worth your surrender</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">um and probably more</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">to phrase it in a more familiar sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">what&#39;s something that&#39;s worthy of your</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">submission</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">um so right i&#39;ll i&#39;ll try and pull it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:38.240" style="s2">an example that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">uh hopefully less contentious than</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">uh transformation in a spiritual sense</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">and then by being properly brainwashed</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">you also feed that value back into the</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">but right it&#39;s it&#39;s well-known</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">information right it takes a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">of reframing how the human mind normally</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">operates</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">to try and cleanse it of its normal</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">so right we we often</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">as we can see what happens when a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">trusted structure like a college which</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">is in the business of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">properly brainwashing people um allows</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">things or things get into its system</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">that are not</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">right people pay you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">they&#39;re 80 grand for their degree</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">and then they get programmed into</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">someone&#39;s pretty overt</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">cultic system um</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">and then they get a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">saying this is what makes them valuable</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">to the rest of the society</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">and you can end up very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">pretty serious issues</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">now all of those issues have been held</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">bay largely from modernism&#39;s bend</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">and i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">almost all of those mechanisms are</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">non-existent</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">for keeping it at some level of purity</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:51.000" style="s2">when you get into transformative</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:54.279" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.000" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">particularly when you move away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.279" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">purity-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">religious practices because they do have</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">a clear measuring standard</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">but when you get into stuff like young&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">integrating the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">or you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">all these you know crazy wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.720" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">in many ways it&#39;s just you know guru</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">gets to do whatever he wants and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">your job</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">to figure out how whatever the hell he</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">happens to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">is some great part of some great</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">right that&#39;s a very dangerous position</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">it um so</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">you&#39;re trading between safety and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">effectiveness constantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">here you know being an individualist is</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">arguably safe</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">you might be extremely deluded but at</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">least you&#39;re deluded unto yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">and not onto a group of people um it</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">if you&#39;re going into a group situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">it&#39;s ability to have a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">effect is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">way higher than your auto didactical</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to open you up for</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">changes that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">not guided by you and are arguably</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">and then when it gets into really</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">effective spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">like integrating a shadow or you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">darker you know crazy wisdom type</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">things that have the potential to create</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">transformation much more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">the danger level starts shooting through</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">the roof</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">and usually people especially in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">cultural climate where we expect</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">instantaneous return on our investment</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s really gonna that&#39;s that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">a major thing to be really</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">aware of um</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">and right the other there&#39;s dangers on</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">the other side as well like a purity</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">now you have something to measure</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">against you can tell who&#39;s full of shit</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">and who isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">you also run into the normal</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">really deep dogmatic and fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">attitudes that come with purity cultures</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">and you can often end up you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">in this circumstance recreating the same</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">there&#39;s dangers on every side here i i</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">probably you know if we look at some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">examples of the systems that work the</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:30.960" style="s2">best in really heavy quotation marks</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.960" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">um creating systems that have numerous</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">levels of checks and balances is</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">seems to be a clear helpful quality</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">sometimes that can undermine the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">authority and then you end up in an</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">fracturing system that&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">protestantism</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">right i don&#39;t know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">you&#39;re trading between variables</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">constantly here and perhaps what would</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">is something like for vicki&#39;s ecology of</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">but for sociological structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">and kind of framing things from how do</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">you keep this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">balance through multiple uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">forms of practice rather than isolating</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">to you know there is uh health and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">here&#39;s exactly what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">type of formation</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:37.279" style="s2">anyone have ideas for dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:39.720" style="s2">enormous cluster of problems see i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:43.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t have any answers here it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.720" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">explorations and having witnessed</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.039" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">how many different ways stuff can go</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">sideways</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s good this is probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">be very deeply unsatisfying</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">can you repeat that last part about</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">healthy systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">right so i was i was taking into account</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">um verveiki&#39;s ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">which is a way that he tries to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">some of the issues that come up</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">with um older religious structures</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">and basically just because you meditate</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">bullshitting yourself matter of fact it</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.279" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">greatly increases the chance that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.519" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">will bullshit yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">um so how do you take a practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">make use of it without it creating the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">extreme propensity for bullshit and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">his answer was well if i balance</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">against this practice and this practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">and this practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">they all kind of like dirty hands</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">washing each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">have a greater chance to to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:50.840" style="s2">and deal with the bullshit that comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">out of one practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">um by you know it becomes revealed in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">another practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">so i was trying to use it as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">perhaps how we might create then in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">sense how we are creating a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">spiritual practice i&#39;m trying to extend</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">that to how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">healthy spiritual community or</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">you know something like that so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">like john&#39;s 50 hours of video</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">one of his main reasons for that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">is i think to answer the question how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:28.639" style="s2">you choose what you submit to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">you know he wants to convince you that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">he&#39;s advocating for are justified based</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">based on science and history and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">rather than just saying hey do this</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">because i tell you to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">right right the problem then is you end</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">up in the post-modern critique of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">anyone can weave any story</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">well or there could be multiple stories</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">that lead to similar</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">results and i think that&#39;s that&#39;s fair i</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t think anyone here john</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">especially would say hey this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">only way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">practices that achieve similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">types of insight you know cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">you know he&#39;s not going to say well you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">have to do my way if you do some other</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">if it&#39;s shown to be effective reliably</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">you know he would say hey that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">a great way too</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">right so that might be considered one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">checks and balances right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">what are you using to measure what</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">success is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">and then how open are you to having</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">pathways of success um i i do</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">again you&#39;re you&#39;re constantly trading</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">off between things</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">right so when you when you open up</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">yourself to that argument</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">you are likewise opening yourself up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">a infinitely fragmenting culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">that can&#39;t act until you kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">settle back down to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s just whatever works for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">works and that&#39;s all there is to it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">now you&#39;ve lost the communal aspect</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.400" style="s2">wisdom transmission outside of what a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.400" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">autodidactically picks up and says i</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">find use in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">again protestantism is a useful example</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">here because you you can like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">watch a unified religion fragment</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">nick have you explored the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">structures inside the church</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">and how they keep healthy uh a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">um you know i la in the last</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">uh talk i used uh orthodox christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">as a good example of a system that has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.560" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">hard in easy out policy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">and how that might work so</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">right anyone&#39;s allowed into the church</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">to listen to any sermon or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">they get it&#39;s open in that sense easy in</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s it takes a lot of dedication</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">and time</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">and practice and interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">community until you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">considered a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">member of the church yeah it was your</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">granted</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">i was more referring to the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">for the institution</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">the ecology of practices for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">institution</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">yeah so i mean it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">clearly bound within a system like</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">like most of us are familiar with at</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">least some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">rituals that are performed uh and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">when you get into protestantism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">basically whatever the hell you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some limitation based on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">denomination you&#39;re claiming</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">but largely it&#39;s whatever the church</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">wants</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">to practice um</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">yeah so yeah so you don&#39;t see any direct</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">solutions or</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">copy paste of all things that is where</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:14.240" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">do i see any direct no i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.240" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to outline the problems to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">give a sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">for the space to play in and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">ideally use examples of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">this seems to work better than this</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">um yeah i have a comment</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">so when i got out of the car</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">i worked with a few therapists and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">i kind of got to see how</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">the therapist community operates in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">uk at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">and they have a lot of checks and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">balances and supervision and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">institutions where they train and blown</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">program of training and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">and there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">boundaries they have to follow and check</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">like if if they were teaching a student</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">and then the student wants to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">romantically involved with them they</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">have to wait</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">for like three years before doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">right and even then they have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">they supervise them</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">there is a lot of this stuff otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">they are just</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">kicked out and lose their accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">and i wasn&#39;t aware of this before i</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">started to do any</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">self development let&#39;s say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">yeah i mean it&#39;s oh sorry continue</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">i was surprised i mean i mean they still</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">go off</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">at times but i feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a good kind of structure because</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">centrally authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">it&#39;s more like collegial</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">right right and i think that is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">like having really clear boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">is definitely a sign you know you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re entering into</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">such fuzzy territory</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">um yeah it helps to have like as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">narcissist you need to have a clear</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">boundaries and you so you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">aware of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">own boundaries and this is the process</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">of learning by bumping against</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">narcissists</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">right right right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">yeah so that would probably you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">incorporating stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">into something like a retina would</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">probably be extremely useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">you know certainly having a deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">awareness of of how that whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">scenario works again i i do think</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">trade-off um</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i i haven&#39;t actually seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">any research on the subject so it would</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">interesting because a a guru type figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">is in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">fulfilling the role of a therapist plus</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">a lot more and so it would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">people&#39;s experiences of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">within themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">in therapy compared to uh various</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">spiritually oriented or religiously</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">oriented systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">um yeah what would the lot more be</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">oh sorry alexi go ahead oh and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.280" style="s2">follow-up on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">so after getting out of that cult i</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.280" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">spoke to a therapist who was</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">at the same cult as me but he went there</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">deliberately to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">to grow because it&#39;s like group work and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">group work in therapy is the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">efficient</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">provided there are good facilitators</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">and i asked him how</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">how does it work when it&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">therapy is really good and he said in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">one case</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">they had the situation where the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">facilitator was not strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">and essentially a few members of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">group just</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">kicked him out and continued so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">they got for a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">and and after a couple of days they</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">decided that the facilitator is not good</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">he was out and they and and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">continued and got to a good kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">place oh interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s kind of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">cognition maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">as john puts it right but then but then</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">the the people have to be kind of on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">similar level</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">yes yeah and you&#39;re gonna encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">of like what do you how do you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">people that are like seriously damaged</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">and offer them something that is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">legitimately useful for them um</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">yeah a lot of it&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">the scope of what you&#39;re in yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">just throwing this because yeah no no</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">yeah didn&#39;t mean to uh yeah argue</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">against it so much as</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">uh nuance it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">um yeah and and uh adam your question</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">what&#39;s the a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">it would be say inducing um religious</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">bringing a person into contact with some</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">type of supernatural thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">offering a community offering a communal</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">like the actual how the community itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.040" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">operates</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that a guru can do that a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">therapist is more limited ability</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">largely because of the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">very often</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">gotcha thank you</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">do we have questions queuing up in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">event text</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple general there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">a couple general questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">uh but i don&#39;t know if you wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">those at the end</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">as general ones or right or throughout</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">yeah if they&#39;re general then we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">of keep pushing through let&#39;s see we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">at an</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">hour already so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">oh i wanted to keep this one a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">bit shorter hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">but we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">um all right let me let me try and make</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">further through the list and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">see where we end up</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">so yes when you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">transformative uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">communities as a very general rule</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">you need some mechanism for enabling</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">surrender</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">and then to have a mechanism to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">account for the slide into submission</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">uh last time i used the example of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">dialogos</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">as they is a practice built</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">to allow surrender with ideally without</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">allowing it to slide into submission but</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">the propensity is there</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">as some people commented watching some</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.319" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">guys saying stocks videos of of circling</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s ever present i but</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">have to figure out that calculus of of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">of putting someone in a state where they</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">can wear</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">transformation is afforded and not used</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">against them</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s hard to hard to pull</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">off but we we played around a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">there with some</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">some like um</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">and yes the side effect of that is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">more you move away from a system like</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">dialogos</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">and closer into a system of like classic</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">student-teacher dynamics um</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">arguably the more effective the actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">transmission will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">and the far more dangerous it will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.920" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">and it will have a much stronger</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">propensity to become</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">a uh a submission based</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">system rather than a surrender based</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">how i&#39;m using those words would probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">to read emmanuel gents paper on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s only like 15 pages a lot of woo</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">and funky stuff in there but i think he</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">is pointing towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">something useful to pull apart</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">so yeah a question that i saw come up</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">in one of the other uh channels in here</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">was people dealing with the issue of how</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">do you pick a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s this kind of endless</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">chicken or egg problem of like only the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">wise recognize the wise</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">right like you can&#39;t actually pick a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.119" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">teacher</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">unless you&#39;re already at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:15.760" style="s2">teaching otherwise you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">kind of blindly relying on some other</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.760" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">process in order to trust the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">coming in or you will be endlessly stuck</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">in a uh combinatorial explosion if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">use a verveikian term here um</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">yeah go for it iron root oh no i was</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">just making the explosion</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:46.319" style="s2">oh um</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:47.359" style="s2">so one of this is tying back into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.319" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.359" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">from earlier as well but you know i</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">think a mechanism that people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">or something people are looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:58.319" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">really hard time getting a grasp of is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:01.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">this difference between narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.599" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">and ontological power and they often</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">look alike and have a really different</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">uh phenomenology underlying them</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">so right to use classic his you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">religious examples we can use the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">christ both of them could be described</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">as extraordinarily narcissistic people</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">um right one saying he is the son of god</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">the other saying he is truly enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">you know like extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">narcissistic claims</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">but the larger question is not the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">immediate appearance but what is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">on the the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">sense emanating from them and compare it</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">to someone like say donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">who is more familiarly um</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">putting out this sense of narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">power and yet you can see</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">it kind of in between the lines</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">that there&#39;s this underlying sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">uh ontological insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s creating the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">the hot air if you will of his</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:19.359" style="s2">is uh mirage image of of being secure in</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.359" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">so by ontological there you mean what</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">their actual being is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">is that what you mean by that being yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">right do they have a sense of security</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">in being itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">or do they have a sense of security in</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">an egoic</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">uh display and how do you tell the two</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">because largely it&#39;s you can really</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">fudge a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">circuits where they think they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:51.040" style="s2">perceiving ontological security</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">and all they are is dealing with uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.040" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">the image of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s an area of investigation i</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.839" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">think that would be interesting i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">again i don&#39;t have any answers here but</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">it does seem like</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">a useful thing to tease apart and try</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">explore uh ideally with a more robust</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">lens than what we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">available to us</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">so it&#39;d be interesting to see if cogsi</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">could deal with</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">something like the difference that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">happening there</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">and what the process is as one example</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">so yeah getting into specific system</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">design i touched on this last time as</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">graduation versus non-graduation</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">this is really a big problem in</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">spiritually oriented groups which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no graduation process</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">which has the side effect of you being a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">perma student</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">this is also a critique i would squarely</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">at verveiki&#39;s project itself because it</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">has a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">a quality of infinite searching um</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">so this is a good way to bind people</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">into a subservient position um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">one of the great qualities of a system</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">like college is that you finish</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">and you prove that you&#39;ve learned what</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">it has to offer</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">and then you go on and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">rules and all that kind of stuff but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">actually go on to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">you know finish your subservient role</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">and become</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">part of the leadership of whatever field</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">that you studied ideally</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">so i would say this is a quality</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">of what makes a healthy cultic system is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">that you leave it</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">at some point and you go out and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">interface with the world and deal with</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">the world on your own terms</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">ideally recreating a kind of a hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">and improving upon what it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">gained by being</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">part of that system likewise you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.200" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">have to actually divorce yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">right colleges have alumni programs you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:17.359" style="s2">can come and teach or have guest</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">roles at the college these are all very</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.359" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">but yeah that&#39;s that one&#39;s a big one</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">it&#39;s you know what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">graduate from a religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">it&#39;s uh confusing right does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:37.680" style="s2">that you are truly enlightened or does</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">it mean that</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">you know the teacher has</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">can&#39;t offer you anything more than your</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:49.119" style="s2">own personal investigation</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.760" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">like where are the limits here</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a reason these systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">never stay in balance for very long</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just difficult</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">issues to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:07.119" style="s2">yeah i mean like a lot of john&#39;s jumping</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">in at any point here</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">a lot of what john&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">almost is way of life like the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">of practices</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">is a way of life right you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not something you ever</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">gradu you ever graduate from because</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;re we&#39;re all you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">tuning your brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">right to optimizing your brain for</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">right right and that&#39;s fine in this auto</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">didactic fashion because it&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">uh it gets a little trickier when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">when he for instance would go to through</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">the process of making an actual</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.760" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">with teachers um teaching these</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.760" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">ecology the ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">asking the question at what point do the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">students of that system</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">stop being students</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">i mean i guess i see it as that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">similar to other wisdom traditions where</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">i mean you&#39;ve got the people who you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">got the students you have teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">people stop being students but they</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">still do their practice they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">part of the community right</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">right right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">figuring out where that line is is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">important many cultic structures you</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">look at do not have a process where you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">are now equal with the person who taught</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">you know you&#39;re just stuck underneath</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">the person that taught you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">forevermore and that&#39;s where you can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:37.440" style="s2">dangerous territory</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">so yeah coming up with some mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.440" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">for how that that works</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">i think is an important area of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">consideration you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">how much of it is actually just learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">the procedural knowledge of what the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">practice is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">and then how much of it is your personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">practice how does that interface with</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">community and how does that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">interface with the community&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">all i&#39;m doing is creating problems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.720" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">solve</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">here i have like zero answers in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:11.200" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:15.599" style="s2">no can i just add to your last</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.200" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">point so when you say graduation</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.599" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">is very good thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.720" end="00:55:26.640" style="s2">on the point that so there is this</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">learning element</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.640" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">or teaching where you kind of get to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">some level but then</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">there is also the practice element so</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.119" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">it may be possible that after a point</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.079" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">you just keep practicing and cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">wisdom or whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">without any need to graduate or any need</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">to be in the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.400" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">student-teacher relationship you just</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.839" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s the point you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">to spread the meme like you need to be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">new teacher</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">in the next generation and also</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">yeah some of the students become</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">teachers right</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.880" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">i feel the frame is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">restrictive if you put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">that has to be a graduation of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">of final</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">well i i think he&#39;s saying that</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">people shouldn&#39;t always be in i guess</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">this subservient</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">position to the teacher where at some</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:49.040" style="s2">point they sort of know approximately as</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">much as the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.040" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">and you know even the teacher may be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">bit more technical</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">and be able to communicate it better</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">that the students pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">have grasped what the teachers offer and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">you know so one point they can say i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">not a student anymore</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not just always in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">under position under you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">right and i mean you could apply that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:14.559" style="s2">same logic to college itself like when a</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">person graduates</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">do they know everything in that field no</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">not by</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">any stretch of the imagination they may</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">they know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:25.280" style="s2">a single percent of the total body of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">knowledge that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.280" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">that field but there is some level of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">having achieved a high enough level of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">proficiency to</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">leave the subservient position and be</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">able to offer something novel</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">onto the field um</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">so how do we mark that transition point</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">and how does it structure itself when</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">you start dealing with something like</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:52.559" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:54.480" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.559" end="00:57:57.119" style="s2">i mean if that was not a project if it</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.480" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">was just here&#39;s some practices that work</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.119" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">do whatever you want with them um</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">this would be a lot less of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:06.880" style="s2">consideration i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">for for viveki&#39;s thing in particular at</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.880" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">also dana your mouth is moving but we</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.640" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re talking to us or</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:37.119" style="s2">oh my sensitivity was too too low</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">i was saying that uh the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.119" end="00:58:40.960" style="s2">not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">at least to me is a framework</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.960" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">for an internal structure that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.599" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">develop within your own</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:49.200" style="s2">self to kind of you know create these</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">structures that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">do get corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">these external structures that that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">normally had you know such as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">church or you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">hierarchy that we would subscribe to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:05.280" style="s2">know the ecology of practice where</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.280" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">your own teacher and your own student</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">you know you&#39;re you&#39;re it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">schizophrenic you&#39;re you&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">really um so that&#39;s how i take the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">written our thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">at least but i i understand your concern</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">at least if</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">a traditional sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:28.319" style="s2">system or hierarchy were to evolve out</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.319" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">you know movement well i would say more</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">verveiki himself claims that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:39.119" style="s2">of written art it&#39;s not meant to be an</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:42.319" style="s2">autodidactic</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.119" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">here&#39;s your journey for yourself he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.319" end="00:59:47.040" style="s2">trying to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">has he said that explicitly explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.040" end="00:59:51.559" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:53.200" style="s2">yeah he he he finds there&#39;s a danger to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.559" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">autodidacticism</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">uh that you know like you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">like hitler was an autodidactic you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">look what he did i remember</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:07.920" style="s2">i remember john uh said it</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.799" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">could breathe narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.920" end="01:00:11.119" style="s2">yeah definitely it could without you</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:15.040" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:17.160" style="s2">the proper checks on it</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.040" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">my critique of his critique of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.160" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">autodidactism was perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">something that you would be in line with</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">as well uh which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">it seems a lot more useful to me to</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">train people how to make use of their</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:32.799" style="s2">auto didactic</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">inclinations rather than to demonize</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.799" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">others well but remember like like</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:37.760" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t consider saying what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">doing here in this in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.760" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">discord as auto diagnostic yeah like so</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">he just says you shouldn&#39;t be doing it</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">on your own</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">like you should have a community around</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">you because you can bounce ideas off</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:54.079" style="s2">they can check you when you&#39;re going off</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">so so here&#39;s you know so what if the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.079" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">graduation process is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve developed enough ability that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">can go off and start a community</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.400" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">of your own you know that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">that is because you got to realize that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">is only sustainable up to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">scale um</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.760" end="01:01:10.799" style="s2">you know at least in this intimate of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">setting</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:14.319" style="s2">i mean shit we can only get 25 people on</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">video chat anyway</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.319" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">it has to be scaled out somehow</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">yep right and that has to be ritualized</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:30.400" style="s2">or ritualized because it should be</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">celebrated as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.400" end="01:01:34.130" style="s2">that square hat on and flip your little</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">thing to the other side</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.130" end="01:01:39.280" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">is that the uh um the amish</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.280" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">no that&#39;s college oh yeah that&#39;s college</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">yeah i wouldn&#39;t know number one</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">i i just wanna i wanna draw your</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">attention to the time and education</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">so just drawing your attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">right yeah so okay yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">isolationist versus consumptive this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:10.319" style="s2">quality that i&#39;ve pointed out as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:10.880" style="s2">quality of healthy versus unhealthy</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.319" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">cults</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.880" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">if your cult requires isolationism to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:17.839" style="s2">it&#39;s really bad that&#39;s the eating your</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">own shit right</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.839" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">mistaking the product for the for the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">uh oh i forgot the goofy line to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:30.720" style="s2">tell people that they&#39;re full of shit in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">a fancy way</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.720" end="01:02:36.079" style="s2">um so basically you need a you need a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">structure that&#39;s constantly interfacing</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">with the world as it happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">and i would argue this is also what</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">makes a healthy world view</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">in a more generalized sense so you need</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">cultic structure that consumes the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">processes it</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">makes sense of it and then is able to</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:56.799" style="s2">uh trans transmute that consumptive</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">process into action</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.799" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s literally just modeling it off of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">our digestive system</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:05.280" style="s2">you know you go and consume something</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:09.039" style="s2">that&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">um and and you know combine it with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">body produce energy as a side effect and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">turn that into further action</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.280" end="01:03:29.760" style="s2">specializing your language we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">kind of watched</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.760" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">struggle with where the line is on this</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.720" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">right you&#39;re you&#39;re forming boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.720" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">by using</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">specialized language you&#39;re also able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:43.520" style="s2">create really useful heuristics that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">condense a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">huge body of information</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">you create an internal sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:55.599" style="s2">community by using specialized language</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">right good friends do the goofy</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.599" end="01:04:00.559" style="s2">handshake or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:01.599" style="s2">these are all important factors they can</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.559" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">also be used</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">against right they can create an</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">isolationist wall</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">they can make it so that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:10.799" style="s2">communicate your ideas well</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">with people unfamiliar with your system</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.799" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">so perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">doing both in this case would be a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">way to do it so</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">allow yourself to create that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:20.319" style="s2">specialized language and also be</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:22.720" style="s2">constantly trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.319" end="01:04:25.119" style="s2">how you can communicate those ideas in</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.720" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">plain language also</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">um so right this is something for</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:32.720" style="s2">example jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:34.640" style="s2">was very helpful for for religious</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.720" end="01:04:36.160" style="s2">people was that he broadened the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.640" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">vocabulary</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.160" end="01:04:40.880" style="s2">and was able to communicate religious or</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">spiritual ideas in a language that was</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">suited for people that were not</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">open to those forms of language</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:54.319" style="s2">so playing with those those realms i</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">think is important</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.319" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.480" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">yeah apocalyptic myths in their</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.240" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">prevalence uh how they can be used to</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">shift our overton window</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.400" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">and also why we can&#39;t do without them</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">so this is just a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">quality but like</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:17.359" style="s2">across the board regardless of whether a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">group is spiritual or not</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.359" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">there is this ins insistence</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:27.920" style="s2">on apocalyptic myths so whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">you know dealing with uh politics and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.920" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">bringing in the nuclear age</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:36.880" style="s2">as part of it if you&#39;re into uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.680" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">ecosystem act you know activism</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:40.079" style="s2">then you&#39;re bringing in global warming</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.079" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">you know obviously all the religions</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">have their their</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">really intense apocalyptic myths i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">a large part</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.760" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">of what creates this prevalence is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">apocalyptic myths are how we project our</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:57.920" style="s2">own death</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">onto the world and then attempt to deal</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.920" end="01:06:01.119" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:02.839" style="s2">and in that sense they are extremely</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.119" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">healthy they are how</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.839" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">because literally</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:09.039" style="s2">all of us will experience the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.039" end="01:06:13.039" style="s2">whether it&#39;s also the apocalypse for</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">everyone else at the same time or</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.039" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">just for you um</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:19.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s a matter of degree not of of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.440" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">quality um so realizing that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s also a necessary feature</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:30.720" style="s2">coming to terms with death</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:33.039" style="s2">uh and the the process by which we do so</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.720" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">and then also being aware of how that</p>

<p begin="01:06:40.319" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">because of a a certain context</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.400" end="01:06:50.079" style="s2">you know again trading off between</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:53.280" style="s2">advantages and disadvantages here</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.079" end="01:06:55.920" style="s2">um yeah you know i i don&#39;t think you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.280" end="01:06:56.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll be able to get away with any type</p>

<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">of apocalyptic structure to it so then</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:05.520" style="s2">the question becomes how do you make use</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.520" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">yeah sorry i&#39;m trying to run through</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.960" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">we again have gone for far longer than i</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">so part four part five part five</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.799" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">yeah no i can&#39;t do any more</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.400" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">um so yeah purity cults and inverse</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">purity cults</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">i kind of went over this earlier talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">about how like</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:44.160" style="s2">some of the advantages and disadvantages</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:46.720" style="s2">the integrating the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.160" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">uh arguably what the left was doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.720" end="01:07:51.359" style="s2">through like the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:53.039" style="s2">80s and 90s right he had like</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.359" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">the left is probably not a good term</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.039" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">here but the counter culture the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:08:00.400" style="s2">artistic counterculture of the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.359" end="01:08:02.640" style="s2">doing things like piss christ and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.400" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">you know arguably the dawning of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.640" end="01:08:07.760" style="s2">post-modern art</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">was like an inverse of a purity cult so</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.760" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.440" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">literally trying to dirty the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:16.319" style="s2">destroy the purity symbols or</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">make them put them in a context where</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.319" end="01:08:20.319" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">you know symbols of an absolute lack of</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.319" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">purity</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:28.239" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:29.600" style="s2">i mean this ties into gnosticism as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.239" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">gnostic the gnostic</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.600" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">drive i would argue is characterized</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">more than</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">anything by the desire for</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:41.679" style="s2">a pure state um</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:43.199" style="s2">so whatever realm that happens in does</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.679" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">not have to be spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.199" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">right it could be a type of moral purity</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">like we&#39;re seeing on</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">on the far left right now lacking any</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">any metaphysics or supernatural element</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.839" end="01:09:00.560" style="s2">um yeah i mean yeah again</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">the eco activists you know that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.560" end="01:09:06.560" style="s2">much a type of purity poll</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:09.040" style="s2">or can be characterized as such</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.560" end="01:09:09.679" style="s2">quite quite literally with pollution as</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.040" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">big bad guy there um</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:18.000" style="s2">again yeah you&#39;re going to end up</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:19.759" style="s2">trading off between things</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.000" end="01:09:21.440" style="s2">you know the the problems of purity</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.759" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">cults are well known they lead to</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.440" end="01:09:25.120" style="s2">repression</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:26.880" style="s2">you end up with things like the catholic</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">priests scandal</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.880" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">um among other issues extreme dogma and</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.319" end="01:09:35.679" style="s2">fundamentalism come with purity cults</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:37.359" style="s2">inverse purity cults also</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.679" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">extraordinarily dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.359" end="01:09:40.560" style="s2">right practicing sexual tantra with your</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:43.759" style="s2">guru</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.560" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">has famously created many issues your</p>

<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">what is bad or what is healthy</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">from what is unhealthy goes out the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">window in</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:58.560" style="s2">inverse purity cults you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">endless examples of that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.560" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">you know sex with the guru being instant</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:04.000" style="s2">transmission</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:06.080" style="s2">but then it ends up the guru just wants</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.080" end="01:10:12.239" style="s2">uh right the the hindu cults where they</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">meditate so deeply on death that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.239" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">eating rotting carcasses</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:18.080" style="s2">of humans to prove that everything is</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.080" end="01:10:25.040" style="s2">or to induce it as an experience</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.000" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.040" end="01:10:28.400" style="s2">which error which class of error do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">want to make and</p>

<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">important questions to ask oneself</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:44.480" style="s2">uh creating a strong idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">difference between dependency</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.480" end="01:10:52.000" style="s2">independency and codependency</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">um there&#39;s so much to say there that i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:40.400" style="s2">so i i have like three more problems you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:41.360" style="s2">guys could meditate on or we could get</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.400" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">to some questions</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.360" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">and conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">problems please problems</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.640" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">okay</p>

<p begin="01:11:55.600" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">john&#39;s reflections on the origins of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">shed some light on or dovetails with</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">meditations on you know cultish because</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:15.040" style="s2">it seems like he</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.880" end="01:12:17.600" style="s2">made a link and it said it&#39;s fuzzy to me</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.040" end="01:12:21.679" style="s2">to put to</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.600" end="01:12:21.679" style="s2">this sacred originating in</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.920" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">something like a a childhood</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">or childlike imprint i&#39;m using that word</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:31.440" style="s2">imprint and i&#39;m thinking of like the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">a duckling is</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.440" end="01:12:38.080" style="s2">imprints on when it&#39;s patches</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">and that leaves such a mark that one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.080" end="01:12:45.120" style="s2">proximity to that</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">um re-encounter with that um</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.120" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">sort of places the individual in touch</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">with their</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">their most their most uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.960" end="01:12:59.679" style="s2">original sense of the sacred or in a way</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:12:59.679" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">that&#39;s experienced as indisputable</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:10.719" style="s2">right it&#39;s a little tricky because</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">verveiki now i&#39;m just getting into</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.719" end="01:13:16.400" style="s2">opinions here so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:18.400" style="s2">shifting categories slightly um</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.400" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">verveiki does the the move where he</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">tries to throw sacredness out or</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:23.520" style="s2">uh tries to throw the sacred out</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:26.239" style="s2">altogether</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.520" end="01:13:27.280" style="s2">and replace it with sacredness and in</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.239" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">many ways i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.280" end="01:13:31.600" style="s2">tried to map that in my own sense making</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">onto the</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.600" end="01:13:37.920" style="s2">ground of being pursuit versus being</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:38.800" style="s2">so in that sense i can understand why he</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.920" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">would describe</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.800" end="01:13:45.840" style="s2">sacredness in the terms of</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:48.560" style="s2">a type of childhood a</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.840" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">uh in the sense that i think sacredness</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.560" end="01:13:51.840" style="s2">is is</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">more directly tied to the oceanic</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.840" end="01:13:57.360" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:13:58.840" style="s2">and then the sacred i would argue from</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.360" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">my own</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.840" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">experiences um is what happens</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">following the experience of sacredness</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:09.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s like from the oceanic</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:13.719" style="s2">experience can you</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.520" end="01:14:17.600" style="s2">you can finally see what</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.719" end="01:14:18.719" style="s2">differentiation is and how beautiful it</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.600" end="01:14:23.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.719" end="01:14:23.679" style="s2">within the proper context um</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.840" end="01:14:31.120" style="s2">so yeah as far as like tying that back</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.199" end="01:14:34.480" style="s2">to coltic structures</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.120" end="01:14:36.320" style="s2">this is this is a weird one because</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.480" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">i almost get the sense that cultic</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.320" end="01:14:41.600" style="s2">structures are how these things</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:44.320" style="s2">limp right they they make the pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.600" end="01:14:45.679" style="s2">available but they don&#39;t offer anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.320" end="01:14:48.320" style="s2">unto the pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.679" end="01:14:49.120" style="s2">in some very deep sense and that would</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.320" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">be almost</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.120" end="01:14:56.800" style="s2">following on like kierkegaard and tilik</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:15:00.080" style="s2">uh kind of the existentialist</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.800" end="01:15:04.320" style="s2">the existentialists and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:06.000" style="s2">if you will um which is that at some</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.320" end="01:15:08.080" style="s2">point you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.000" end="01:15:09.520" style="s2">you know to the god beyond the god of</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.080" end="01:15:12.719" style="s2">theism</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.520" end="01:15:16.159" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re stuck always looking at</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.719" end="01:15:18.239" style="s2">the idol of god and not the icon</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.159" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">and i think that cultic structures</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.239" end="01:15:22.719" style="s2">fundamentally opera</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.840" end="01:15:23.520" style="s2">offer us the idols and in the very best</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.719" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.520" end="01:15:28.880" style="s2">they offer us they afford us the ability</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">to see the icon within the idol</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.880" end="01:15:32.159" style="s2">but it is not by any means programmable</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.159" end="01:15:37.679" style="s2">within occultic structure um</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">and you see this in all religious</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.679" end="01:15:41.440" style="s2">traditions right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">you see it in buddhism as well like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.440" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2">last thing you have to throw away</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:47.120" style="s2">is enlightenment itself like you you</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.400" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.120" end="01:15:51.040" style="s2">you cannot become enlightened by trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.199" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">to become enlightened</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.040" end="01:15:56.719" style="s2">um right in some deep sense you&#39;d see it</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.800" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">in christianity</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.719" end="01:16:03.199" style="s2">in the failure of work</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:05.679" style="s2">right at some point you need grace you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.199" end="01:16:10.239" style="s2">have to release</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.679" end="01:16:12.400" style="s2">uh in order to to be afforded grace</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.239" end="01:16:14.880" style="s2">um the the issues with that have been</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:15.600" style="s2">made very obvious by various protestant</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.600" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">theologians uh calvin of course taking</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:26.239" style="s2">it to its furthest conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:26.239" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.840" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know did i talk on what you</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.679" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">were aiming at there or</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.719" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">yeah i mean my aim wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.880" end="01:16:46.080" style="s2">very narrow or tight is this i&#39;m struck</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:50.320" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.080" end="01:16:52.080" style="s2">the first day of school so your freshman</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.320" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">in high school or your first day on</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.080" end="01:16:57.679" style="s2">college campus and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:17:00.960" style="s2">a mode of being that&#39;s extremely porous</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.679" end="01:17:03.440" style="s2">and highly imprintable</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.960" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">and so it seems like in that state those</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.440" end="01:17:09.120" style="s2">encounters</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">have such a deep resonance that they can</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.120" end="01:17:16.239" style="s2">reverberate down through the years</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:19.679" style="s2">i hear people tell war stories</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.239" end="01:17:21.600" style="s2">50 years later and they have</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.679" end="01:17:23.760" style="s2">the whole life to talk about but what</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.600" end="01:17:23.760" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.800" end="01:17:28.560" style="s2">reminisce on is that day they were in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.679" end="01:17:32.000" style="s2">foxhole</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.560" end="01:17:36.000" style="s2">in that cold winter storm and</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.000" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">it was it without lifting a finger</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.000" end="01:17:43.360" style="s2">they suffered or underwent a revelation</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:46.000" style="s2">that marked them or imprinted them</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.360" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">or characterized them so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.000" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">something about the cult</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">or the sacred where each each of us is</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.679" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">getting nailed in a way</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.199" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about us that</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:18:00.080" style="s2">wants to be nailed right</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">and i might i might differentiate there</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.080" end="01:18:02.640" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">it really depends on kind of the lens</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.640" end="01:18:06.960" style="s2">we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:07.679" style="s2">but it&#39;s like you know the military is</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.960" end="01:18:09.920" style="s2">the cult</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:11.600" style="s2">that afforded the experience in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.920" end="01:18:13.440" style="s2">foxhole</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.600" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">right and part of that was like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.440" end="01:18:17.600" style="s2">extreme training</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">the growing of a brotherhood between a a</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.600" end="01:18:22.719" style="s2">squadron or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:23.600" style="s2">um right it kind of it has all these</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.719" end="01:18:27.199" style="s2">systems that</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:28.560" style="s2">enable uh that scenario to reach its</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.199" end="01:18:32.640" style="s2">peak</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.560" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">experience of of meaning or or reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:36.960" style="s2">but the cultic structure itself did not</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:40.960" style="s2">offer the experience</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.960" end="01:18:44.080" style="s2">it was instead what allowed the</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.960" end="01:18:47.360" style="s2">uh contextualized the experience</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.080" end="01:18:48.000" style="s2">so you get kind of both affecting each</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.360" end="01:18:50.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.000" end="01:18:51.280" style="s2">in a in a very deep sense right viveki&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.480" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.280" end="01:18:58.159" style="s2">inter penetration um</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:19:00.080" style="s2">which very suggestive language</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.159" end="01:19:02.960" style="s2">i thought the same thing when he said uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.080" end="01:19:02.960" style="s2">wants to be nailed</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.280" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">i&#39;m used to it from</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.640" end="01:19:19.760" style="s2">yeah this is a great conversation thanks</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.679" end="01:19:23.840" style="s2">for doing this again by the way nick</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.760" end="01:19:23.840" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely</p>

<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:45.040" style="s2">should we answer some of these that have</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.719" end="01:19:48.159" style="s2">built up in</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.040" end="01:19:48.159" style="s2">sure and uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.719" end="01:19:53.040" style="s2">so ilu who&#39;s not here right now to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:54.960" style="s2">comment uh i also spent time two years</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.040" end="01:19:56.719" style="s2">in a cult from 18 to 20.</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.960" end="01:19:58.080" style="s2">the governing structure was alleged to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.719" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">be one of the consensus-based</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.080" end="01:20:01.440" style="s2">decision-making</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:03.120" style="s2">one of consensus-based decision-making</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.440" end="01:20:04.719" style="s2">but ultimately the lack of information</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.120" end="01:20:06.639" style="s2">flow throughout the community</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.719" end="01:20:08.639" style="s2">enabled those in control of information</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.639" end="01:20:09.440" style="s2">to leverage their expertise to control</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.639" end="01:20:11.440" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.440" end="01:20:13.280" style="s2">example we defer to the finance guy and</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.440" end="01:20:14.800" style="s2">finances etc</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:16.560" style="s2">there was a lot of social control and</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.800" end="01:20:18.800" style="s2">eroding of individuality</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.560" end="01:20:20.639" style="s2">and general exploitation it was</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.800" end="01:20:23.679" style="s2">ultimately shut down by the state as</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.639" end="01:20:27.360" style="s2">historic abuse was uncovered</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.679" end="01:20:28.400" style="s2">wow it was more of a comment yeah wow i</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.360" end="01:20:30.800" style="s2">wish i could</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.400" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">talk to him to get more of what that</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.800" end="01:20:34.960" style="s2">experience is like</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:35.840" style="s2">but just on the surface this is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.960" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">type of thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.840" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">where it&#39;s like you know you think</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:43.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve come up with a rock solid</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:46.639" style="s2">structure system that&#39;s gonna you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.600" end="01:20:48.400" style="s2">work well and it&#39;s the levels</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.639" end="01:20:50.560" style="s2">this is like what i try and talk about</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:53.440" style="s2">with the naivety</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:56.159" style="s2">of of people it&#39;s like thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be able to design</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.159" end="01:21:03.199" style="s2">the one system uh that does not corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">horrifyingly in all of human history</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.199" end="01:21:06.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like if if there was an answer to</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.960" end="01:21:08.400" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.080" end="01:21:09.679" style="s2">we would all be living in the utopia and</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.400" end="01:21:11.360" style="s2">we would have gotten here a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.679" end="01:21:16.650" style="s2">thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.360" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s i think you underestimate mark</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.650" end="01:21:24.320" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:26.320" style="s2">maybe so um so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.320" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">again i i don&#39;t know like a way around</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.320" end="01:21:30.560" style="s2">that than checks and balances</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">thinking that you know you&#39;ve dodged the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.560" end="01:21:34.159" style="s2">problem because</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:34.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve created a system a healthy system</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.159" end="01:21:37.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.880" end="01:21:38.239" style="s2">meritocracy or whatever that&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:41.679" style="s2">to corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.239" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">or i don&#39;t know man i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.679" end="01:21:50.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a really intense set of problems</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:52.239" style="s2">probably the safest to some degree is</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.239" end="01:21:53.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason where an individualist</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.239" end="01:21:56.480" style="s2">culture and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.440" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">individualism is so safely ineffective</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.480" end="01:22:01.920" style="s2">that it allows people to like</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:04.400" style="s2">live off the meager scraps of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.920" end="01:22:06.239" style="s2">without a lot of the dangers that come</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.400" end="01:22:08.960" style="s2">with partaking in these</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.239" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">uh larger social structures and we we</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.960" end="01:22:10.880" style="s2">have not come up with a good answer for</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:13.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.880" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s it as not to say we should not</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.360" end="01:22:16.080" style="s2">be trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.000" style="s2">it means we should be extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.080" end="01:22:19.120" style="s2">skeptical in our ability to actually do</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.000" end="01:22:21.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:23.440" style="s2">i&#39;m also very aware you know try to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.679" end="01:22:25.280" style="s2">very mindful of</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.440" end="01:22:27.040" style="s2">are we succeeding and what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.280" end="01:22:28.639" style="s2">to accomplish and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.040" end="01:22:32.400" style="s2">you know what is the actual practical</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.639" end="01:22:36.239" style="s2">effect of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.400" end="01:22:38.239" style="s2">all right adam had a question but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.239" end="01:22:40.719" style="s2">not going to talk</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.239" end="01:22:41.600" style="s2">yeah without them well maybe we&#39;ll we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.719" end="01:22:43.760" style="s2">see if</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.600" end="01:22:45.040" style="s2">uh talk to elu and maybe ely will want</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.760" end="01:22:46.560" style="s2">to come and</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.040" end="01:22:48.400" style="s2">share a bit of their experience in</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.560" end="01:22:50.880" style="s2">another day</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.400" end="01:22:53.120" style="s2">yeah get a call there&#39;s like three or</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.880" end="01:22:56.159" style="s2">four of us that have</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.120" end="01:22:58.960" style="s2">maybe more that have pretty intense cult</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.159" end="01:23:01.679" style="s2">experience so we could get like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.960" end="01:23:04.159" style="s2">for obvious reasons i mean learning from</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.679" end="01:23:05.920" style="s2">your guy&#39;s experience is very important</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.159" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">to me and i know a lot of people here</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.920" end="01:23:13.440" style="s2">yeah we want to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:16.159" style="s2">that you know we you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.440" end="01:23:19.600" style="s2">you know there is the danger here and we</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.159" end="01:23:22.800" style="s2">so we&#39;re aware of it and we want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.600" end="01:23:24.080" style="s2">so learn from others other mistakes adam</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.800" end="01:23:24.400" style="s2">had a question but i think it&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.080" end="01:23:27.520" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.400" end="01:23:29.040" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m sorry did you want to yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.520" end="01:23:31.440" style="s2">was just going to no wait no it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.040" end="01:23:31.440" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.960" end="01:23:36.800" style="s2">um oh i was just gonna throw in as well</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.239" end="01:23:39.280" style="s2">to your</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.800" end="01:23:40.960" style="s2">your point there brett just that uh you</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.280" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">know it it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.960" end="01:23:44.400" style="s2">i mean yes it&#39;s highly salient in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:47.120" style="s2">group like</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.400" end="01:23:47.440" style="s2">this one where it is it has an emphasis</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.120" end="01:23:50.320" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.440" end="01:23:51.360" style="s2">transformative community and and also is</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.320" end="01:23:54.080" style="s2">trying to create a</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.360" end="01:23:56.000" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion um but i</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.080" end="01:23:59.040" style="s2">i would also argue like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.000" end="01:24:02.719" style="s2">increasingly prevalent across the board</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.040" end="01:24:07.280" style="s2">as people starving for meaning</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.719" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.280" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">it seems clear to me that postmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.840" style="s2">ends in something like a whole hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">lot of cults</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.840" end="01:24:18.159" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t see a clear way out of</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:18.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.480" end="01:24:23.440" style="s2">yeah and that seems to be happening so</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.520" end="01:24:25.679" style="s2">at various levels that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.440" end="01:24:27.600" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.679" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s all very important stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.600" end="01:24:32.239" style="s2">people that have experienced the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:33.280" style="s2">extremes of these realms learning from</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.239" end="01:24:35.040" style="s2">from what they have</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.280" end="01:24:37.679" style="s2">uh experienced i think is really</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.040" end="01:24:39.040" style="s2">important so jana&#39;s not here but she had</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.679" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">outside of this</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.040" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">but she had a question can you tell us</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:43.520" style="s2">more about the people that were part of</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:45.040" style="s2">the cult</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.520" end="01:24:46.239" style="s2">what kind of reasons did they have for</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.040" end="01:24:47.520" style="s2">ending up there and can you say</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.239" end="01:24:48.880" style="s2">something about the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.520" end="01:24:52.560" style="s2">people who stayed there</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.880" end="01:24:52.560" style="s2">and the ones that were able to leave</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:25:00.480" style="s2">right we skipped adam</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.120" end="01:25:00.480" style="s2">coolest cult of all time</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.800" end="01:25:05.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know there&#39;s been a i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.440" end="01:25:07.600" style="s2">i&#39;ll probably just</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.040" end="01:25:08.320" style="s2">blanket answer with my religion to dodge</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.600" end="01:25:10.480" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.320" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">so christianity is the coolest cult of</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.480" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">all time</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.679" end="01:25:26.000" style="s2">uh okay so jana&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:28.800" style="s2">yeah so type of people that were in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.000" end="01:25:31.920" style="s2">cult there&#39;s often the character</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.800" end="01:25:34.320" style="s2">that people that join colts are like</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.920" end="01:25:36.560" style="s2">you know really screwed up to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.320" end="01:25:39.600" style="s2">or or have some type of</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.560" end="01:25:42.800" style="s2">heavy thing that makes them</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.600" end="01:25:45.440" style="s2">open or overly suggestible</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.800" end="01:25:46.800" style="s2">um in my experience that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.440" end="01:25:50.080" style="s2">particularly true</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.800" end="01:25:50.080" style="s2">and like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.239" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s the case like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.920" end="01:25:56.239" style="s2">person was at a really heavy</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:58.719" style="s2">transitional phase in their life</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.239" end="01:26:01.440" style="s2">um and then you just get these like</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.719" end="01:26:05.280" style="s2">miraculous aligning of circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.440" end="01:26:07.440" style="s2">where uh the person you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.280" end="01:26:09.120" style="s2">gets funneled in at just the right</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.440" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">moment that&#39;s probably why</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.120" end="01:26:12.800" style="s2">why the the j dubs are so successful at</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.000" end="01:26:15.120" style="s2">being bringing</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.800" end="01:26:17.280" style="s2">people in it&#39;s just like if you knock on</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.120" end="01:26:18.560" style="s2">someone&#39;s door constantly eventually</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.280" end="01:26:21.679" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find the guy that was</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.560" end="01:26:23.840" style="s2">having a midlife crisis that day</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.679" end="01:26:25.679" style="s2">you know and takes it as a sign from god</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.840" end="01:26:29.040" style="s2">that you knocked on their door</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.679" end="01:26:29.040" style="s2">whatever um</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.760" end="01:26:33.280" style="s2">so yeah there is there was some level of</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.560" end="01:26:36.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.280" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">going through a heavy transition point</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.560" end="01:26:43.120" style="s2">in general though there was not a clear</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:46.239" style="s2">um commonality on on the people</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.120" end="01:26:48.480" style="s2">that i saw in those those circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.239" end="01:26:50.400" style="s2">for people that started the cults there</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.480" end="01:26:52.880" style="s2">was a lot more of a clear</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.400" end="01:26:53.440" style="s2">sign and that&#39;s that they went through</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.880" end="01:26:56.480" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.440" end="01:26:58.400" style="s2">extreme transition that resulted</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.480" end="01:27:00.960" style="s2">in them believing they&#39;d come to an</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.400" end="01:27:01.440" style="s2">answer as opposed to leaving them in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.960" end="01:27:04.960" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.440" end="01:27:05.440" style="s2">mired ground of chaos that most people</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.960" end="01:27:07.600" style="s2">end up</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.440" end="01:27:09.280" style="s2">in when going through transformative</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.600" end="01:27:12.239" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.280" end="01:27:13.360" style="s2">um and then they tried to share that</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.239" end="01:27:15.440" style="s2">message</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.360" end="01:27:17.280" style="s2">usually not with the intention of</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.440" end="01:27:20.000" style="s2">creating a cult</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.280" end="01:27:20.639" style="s2">and then a cult forms around it as they</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.000" end="01:27:22.320" style="s2">try and</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.639" end="01:27:25.360" style="s2">teach whatever it is they learned</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.320" end="01:27:25.360" style="s2">through that experience</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.320" end="01:27:30.159" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s more overt like the</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.000" end="01:27:32.639" style="s2">person was like you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.159" end="01:27:33.360" style="s2">normal the normal way of living sucks</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.639" end="01:27:36.000" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.360" end="01:27:37.600" style="s2">build this bad ass farm and just invite</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.000" end="01:27:39.440" style="s2">people i like to it</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:41.760" style="s2">and then it gets weird as they try and</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.440" end="01:27:43.120" style="s2">navigate problems in a novel way and</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.760" end="01:27:44.960" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.120" end="01:27:47.040" style="s2">you know they end up doing the whole</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.960" end="01:27:50.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.040" end="01:27:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s such a broad phenomena i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.000" end="01:27:53.840" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.480" end="01:27:56.080" style="s2">quite answer this question as far as</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.840" end="01:27:58.719" style="s2">the difference between people who stayed</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.080" end="01:28:02.080" style="s2">and those that were able to leave</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.719" end="01:28:03.679" style="s2">a lot of that came down to sunk</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.080" end="01:28:08.000" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.679" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">and then that combined with just the</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.000" end="01:28:14.719" style="s2">novel circumstances of the person&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:17.920" style="s2">at that exact moment in time um</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.719" end="01:28:19.920" style="s2">you know for me what enabled me to</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.920" end="01:28:21.840" style="s2">break off from the one that i was like</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.920" end="01:28:23.440" style="s2">really in because the others were fairly</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.840" end="01:28:27.600" style="s2">easy to leave</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.440" end="01:28:30.080" style="s2">um was was the yellow and red flag</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.600" end="01:28:31.440" style="s2">system that i told you guys about in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.080" end="01:28:35.199" style="s2">last one</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.440" end="01:28:35.920" style="s2">um and i had like let a number of yellow</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.199" end="01:28:38.719" style="s2">flags</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.920" end="01:28:39.360" style="s2">slide until i got to a point where i</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.719" end="01:28:43.040" style="s2">could see</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.360" end="01:28:45.120" style="s2">myself recreating a situation that i had</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.040" end="01:28:47.360" style="s2">experienced earlier that was very</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.120" end="01:28:50.560" style="s2">traumatizing for me</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.360" end="01:28:53.520" style="s2">um and so that was like</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.560" end="01:28:54.480" style="s2">what kicked me out and even then i did</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.520" end="01:28:57.679" style="s2">so with like</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.480" end="01:28:58.800" style="s2">zero security in my decision like i did</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.679" end="01:29:00.880" style="s2">not know if</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.800" end="01:29:03.199" style="s2">you know the red flags that i thought</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.880" end="01:29:04.320" style="s2">were red flags were actually red flags</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.199" end="01:29:07.360" style="s2">or if i was just</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.320" end="01:29:10.800" style="s2">building it up in my head right</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.360" end="01:29:13.520" style="s2">i just couldn&#39;t tell and uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.800" end="01:29:14.320" style="s2">given enough time i was proven correct</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.520" end="01:29:17.280" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.320" end="01:29:19.840" style="s2">um well that&#39;s probably a useful project</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.280" end="01:29:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why i put so much</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.840" end="01:29:22.880" style="s2">go ahead i would say that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.880" end="01:29:25.280" style="s2">useful project for us is to put together</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.880" end="01:29:28.159" style="s2">a list of these yellow and red flags</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.280" end="01:29:28.719" style="s2">uh for us to keep in mind you know you</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.159" end="01:29:30.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.719" end="01:29:32.880" style="s2">especially you know from my part instead</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.960" end="01:29:36.320" style="s2">of organizing all this and</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.880" end="01:29:37.440" style="s2">and and and for people to to to watch</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.320" end="01:29:39.679" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.440" end="01:29:40.960" style="s2">to say hey maybe we&#39;re going too much in</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.679" end="01:29:42.000" style="s2">this direction in this negative</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.960" end="01:29:43.600" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.000" end="01:29:46.159" style="s2">so that might be right that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.600" end="01:29:48.760" style="s2">we should work on</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.159" end="01:29:50.080" style="s2">and it is like it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.760" end="01:29:52.719" style="s2">overemphasize</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.080" end="01:29:53.600" style="s2">how important that type of system is</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.719" end="01:29:55.520" style="s2">again when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.600" end="01:29:56.800" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re entering into an</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.520" end="01:29:59.760" style="s2">exploratory</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.800" end="01:30:02.159" style="s2">state dealing with a novel world view or</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.760" end="01:30:05.440" style="s2">cultic structure</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.159" end="01:30:09.280" style="s2">um like</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.440" end="01:30:12.719" style="s2">you will lose your normal mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.280" end="01:30:15.280" style="s2">for telling one thing from another</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.719" end="01:30:16.800" style="s2">like you you necessarily will lose those</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.280" end="01:30:20.639" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.800" end="01:30:22.800" style="s2">any type of effective work on you at all</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.639" end="01:30:24.320" style="s2">if it&#39;s totally ineffective then yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.800" end="01:30:25.280" style="s2">you&#39;re probably fine and you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.320" end="01:30:30.320" style="s2">getting nothing from</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.280" end="01:30:30.320" style="s2">it um so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.480" end="01:30:34.960" style="s2">that one is i i really think it is</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.040" end="01:30:36.639" style="s2">really important and it also i think is</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.960" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">a good practice</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.639" end="01:30:42.800" style="s2">for getting a person to like</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:42.800" style="s2">learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.719" end="01:30:51.679" style="s2">trust themselves while affording them</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.000" end="01:30:55.600" style="s2">a a legitimately and truly and deeply</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.679" end="01:30:56.159" style="s2">exploratory state so balancing those two</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.600" end="01:31:00.800" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.159" end="01:31:00.800" style="s2">as as usual yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.600" end="01:31:05.120" style="s2">so i don&#39;t have anything else there i</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.280" end="01:31:07.520" style="s2">wish i wish she was still here</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.120" end="01:31:08.719" style="s2">because i&#39;d like to hear a little more</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.520" end="01:31:11.440" style="s2">about this question</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.719" end="01:31:13.120" style="s2">but uh lemurian like crystal asks a</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.440" end="01:31:14.960" style="s2">common superficial assessment of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.120" end="01:31:16.560" style="s2">discord server by people i&#39;ve invited</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.960" end="01:31:19.199" style="s2">here is that it is culti</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.560" end="01:31:20.159" style="s2">what can we do to change this now i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.199" end="01:31:21.520" style="s2">like to hear a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.159" end="01:31:22.320" style="s2">what the specific comments were</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.520" end="01:31:25.520" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.320" end="01:31:30.400" style="s2">but uh you know i think we tried</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.520" end="01:31:33.440" style="s2">not to be uh but uh but</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.400" end="01:31:35.600" style="s2">specialized language and the upfront</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.440" end="01:31:36.639" style="s2">cost of 50 hours of lectures from a</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.600" end="01:31:39.120" style="s2">single person</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.639" end="01:31:40.480" style="s2">i would say would set off most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.120" end="01:31:43.600" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.480" end="01:31:45.840" style="s2">um more so than anything else</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.600" end="01:31:47.040" style="s2">i would imagine if i was coming into</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.840" end="01:31:49.280" style="s2">this in a novel</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.040" end="01:31:50.480" style="s2">situation that&#39;s probably what would</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.280" end="01:31:52.719" style="s2">trigger my</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.480" end="01:31:55.120" style="s2">my perception so so i mean this is a bit</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.719" end="01:31:59.120" style="s2">of a rock and a hard place because</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.120" end="01:32:00.320" style="s2">i think the educational aspects of of</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.120" end="01:32:03.199" style="s2">that course i think are</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.320" end="01:32:03.760" style="s2">are pretty pretty darn important for</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.199" end="01:32:07.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.760" end="01:32:10.239" style="s2">like if we want people to not just</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.520" end="01:32:12.000" style="s2">trust us to say you know that hey this</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.239" end="01:32:12.560" style="s2">is what we&#39;re doing because it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.000" end="01:32:15.600" style="s2">say hey</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.560" end="01:32:16.719" style="s2">this is why we&#39;re doing it uh so without</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.600" end="01:32:18.320" style="s2">going through the course</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.719" end="01:32:19.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any idea of that unless</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.320" end="01:32:22.080" style="s2">you have your own background</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.920" end="01:32:22.960" style="s2">in all the stuff but the vast majority</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.080" end="01:32:26.480" style="s2">of people probably</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.960" end="01:32:29.040" style="s2">don&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.480" end="01:32:29.920" style="s2">but but i but yeah it can seem daunting</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.040" end="01:32:33.199" style="s2">i wonder if we should</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.920" end="01:32:36.239" style="s2">create a just a shorter version of it</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.199" end="01:32:37.440" style="s2">uh for people but it yeah i mean a tough</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.239" end="01:32:41.120" style="s2">problem the intro</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.440" end="01:32:43.120" style="s2">is a legitimate intro like people can</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.120" end="01:32:44.480" style="s2">watch the first video in the series and</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.120" end="01:32:46.400" style="s2">at least get an idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.480" end="01:32:48.239" style="s2">and i when i pointed those out i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.400" end="01:32:50.080" style="s2">mean to argue that we should do</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.239" end="01:32:51.679" style="s2">something to change them</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.080" end="01:32:54.159" style="s2">at some level there is like a</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.679" end="01:32:57.920" style="s2">self-selection pressure that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.159" end="01:33:02.960" style="s2">actually useful um</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.920" end="01:33:02.960" style="s2">so can we see the cat</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.000" end="01:33:10.239" style="s2">yeah i think brett the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.600" end="01:33:13.440" style="s2">problem to nick&#39;s point is</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.239" end="01:33:14.159" style="s2">for all intents and purposes we are a</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.440" end="01:33:18.080" style="s2">cult</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.159" end="01:33:20.159" style="s2">right we have all of the credentials</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.080" end="01:33:22.159" style="s2">because cults are these things that are</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.159" end="01:33:23.920" style="s2">everywhere and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.159" end="01:33:26.239" style="s2">the question is how do you get people</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.920" end="01:33:27.440" style="s2">interested and involved without thinking</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.239" end="01:33:28.639" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to get trapped</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.440" end="01:33:30.800" style="s2">because the</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.639" end="01:33:32.400" style="s2">the meditation traditions do the same</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.800" end="01:33:34.000" style="s2">thing right they oh we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.400" end="01:33:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get you enlightenment just</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.000" end="01:33:37.679" style="s2">get some vocabulary and come on we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:33:37.679" end="01:33:40.400" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.400" end="01:33:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s fine and the next thing you know i</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.400" end="01:33:43.440" style="s2">mean that&#39;s dianetics</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.600" end="01:33:45.040" style="s2">that&#39;s how people get into diabetics</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.440" end="01:33:47.040" style="s2">right they read the book</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.040" end="01:33:48.880" style="s2">well i i got all custom language there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.040" end="01:33:50.560" style="s2">also the next definition of cults a</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.880" end="01:33:52.560" style="s2">little broader i think the</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.560" end="01:33:54.320" style="s2">the the question or this is culture the</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.560" end="01:33:55.280" style="s2">way i was just referring to it as a more</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.320" end="01:33:58.239" style="s2">the negative</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.280" end="01:33:58.719" style="s2">the negative sense of you know like nick</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.239" end="01:34:01.840" style="s2">has the</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.719" end="01:34:03.679" style="s2">positive cult and the negative cult um</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.840" end="01:34:05.120" style="s2">you know the idea is at least to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.679" end="01:34:05.840" style="s2">the negative being the negative one</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.120" end="01:34:09.120" style="s2">although i</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.840" end="01:34:09.760" style="s2">i i i&#39;m not convinced that cult is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.120" end="01:34:13.120" style="s2">word that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.760" end="01:34:15.600" style="s2">worth saving at this point that</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.120" end="01:34:16.840" style="s2">that that it&#39;s been tarnished pretty</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.600" end="01:34:19.760" style="s2">pretty well and</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.840" end="01:34:21.440" style="s2">uh you know it has a negative</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.760" end="01:34:24.480" style="s2">connotation that i think we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.440" end="01:34:24.480" style="s2">stuck with for a while and</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.719" end="01:34:28.639" style="s2">i think trying to resonate trying to</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.639" end="01:34:29.280" style="s2">save the term would be distrustful to</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.639" end="01:34:31.679" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.280" end="01:34:33.120" style="s2">you know i think they would think oh why</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.679" end="01:34:36.400" style="s2">are they trying to say the word cult</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.120" end="01:34:36.400" style="s2">they&#39;re probably because they&#39;re a cult</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.760" end="01:34:42.960" style="s2">yeah well the the other option is is you</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.880" end="01:34:43.679" style="s2">go the normal proselytizing route and</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.960" end="01:34:45.760" style="s2">then you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.679" end="01:34:47.520" style="s2">consumed with making sure your thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.760" end="01:34:51.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t a cult when it obviously</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.520" end="01:34:53.840" style="s2">is um yeah but i i take the criticism</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.360" end="01:34:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious you know it&#39;s brought up a</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.840" end="01:34:56.400" style="s2">lot that&#39;s why i try and use cultic</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.760" end="01:34:58.480" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.400" end="01:34:59.440" style="s2">to like strip it from some of its</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.480" end="01:35:01.280" style="s2">connotation</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.440" end="01:35:02.560" style="s2">while trying to get people to be more</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.280" end="01:35:05.520" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.560" end="01:35:05.920" style="s2">um but i think there is at some level</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.520" end="01:35:07.679" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.920" end="01:35:09.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a point where the gut punch i</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.679" end="01:35:11.679" style="s2">think is useful</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.280" end="01:35:13.040" style="s2">um or the frame break you know i i think</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.679" end="01:35:16.560" style="s2">everyone talking about how</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.040" end="01:35:18.960" style="s2">everything is tribal nowadays is not</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.560" end="01:35:19.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just dodging what is actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.960" end="01:35:21.840" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.760" end="01:35:23.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s doing so in a way that does not</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.840" end="01:35:25.600" style="s2">give us very useful</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.119" end="01:35:26.719" style="s2">tools for dealing with the scenario well</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.600" end="01:35:28.159" style="s2">yeah i have thoughts on that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.719" end="01:35:30.639" style="s2">another conversation not recovering the</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.159" end="01:35:30.639" style="s2">word is</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.440" end="01:35:37.920" style="s2">but but i mean so so i think i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.560" end="01:35:41.040" style="s2">obviously i</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.920" end="01:35:42.480" style="s2">whether we call it i would</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.040" end="01:35:44.080" style="s2">certainly not want people to associate</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.480" end="01:35:45.040" style="s2">this with the negative type of cult if</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.080" end="01:35:46.159" style="s2">they&#39;re going to associate it with</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.040" end="01:35:48.800" style="s2">colton now</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.159" end="01:35:49.760" style="s2">and uh i mean one one idea we played</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.800" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">with is you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.760" end="01:35:53.600" style="s2">creating the aspirant role so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.360" end="01:35:55.280" style="s2">the the easy barrier of entry of just</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.600" end="01:35:56.800" style="s2">anybody can come in and take part and</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.280" end="01:35:58.480" style="s2">sit with us and all that but then for</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.800" end="01:36:00.400" style="s2">those who want to go deeper</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.480" end="01:36:01.679" style="s2">you know you know and make more of a</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.400" end="01:36:03.600" style="s2">commitment you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.679" end="01:36:05.119" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re the people who will</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.600" end="01:36:06.639" style="s2">commit to</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.119" end="01:36:08.880" style="s2">watching the whole series for example</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.639" end="01:36:11.360" style="s2">and you know to following the ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.880" end="01:36:14.880" style="s2">practices and things like that those are</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.360" end="01:36:18.080" style="s2">you know ideas floating around right now</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.880" end="01:36:19.199" style="s2">right and that&#39;s gonna greatly increase</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.080" end="01:36:22.639" style="s2">the perception of</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.199" end="01:36:24.320" style="s2">it being culty yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.639" end="01:36:26.320" style="s2">yeah i mean on the other hand you do</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.320" end="01:36:28.159" style="s2">want people to</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.320" end="01:36:29.760" style="s2">you do want people to have a more</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.159" end="01:36:33.199" style="s2">invested role i think</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.760" end="01:36:34.159" style="s2">uh and so so it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s a rock and a</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.199" end="01:36:38.159" style="s2">hard place</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.159" end="01:36:39.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s yes yes at some point that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.159" end="01:36:41.199" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.280" end="01:36:43.119" style="s2">say as well is like at some point you</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.199" end="01:36:45.520" style="s2">just kind of go you accept</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.119" end="01:36:47.600" style="s2">what it is you&#39;re actually attempting</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.520" end="01:36:49.280" style="s2">you become very aware of the dangers and</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.600" end="01:36:51.199" style="s2">risks and then you start playing with</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.280" end="01:36:52.000" style="s2">the dynamics because if you want it to</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.199" end="01:36:54.320" style="s2">work or have</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.000" end="01:36:55.199" style="s2">any chance of doing anything you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.320" end="01:36:58.560" style="s2">going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.199" end="01:37:00.880" style="s2">play with those dynamics eventually</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.560" end="01:37:00.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.800" end="01:37:07.840" style="s2">so then we have conversations like this</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.119" end="01:37:09.520" style="s2">and try and deal with</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.840" end="01:37:10.880" style="s2">the dangers but yeah as far as playing</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.520" end="01:37:13.760" style="s2">like a pr game of</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.880" end="01:37:14.480" style="s2">things that look culty and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.760" end="01:37:17.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.480" end="01:37:20.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how effective that is i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.679" end="01:37:22.000" style="s2">far more concerned with is there any</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.560" end="01:37:24.480" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.000" end="01:37:25.119" style="s2">abuse or native impact on the people</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.480" end="01:37:28.000" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.119" end="01:37:28.400" style="s2">participating than i am with what&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.000" end="01:37:31.600" style="s2">pers</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.400" end="01:37:35.840" style="s2">public relations you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.600" end="01:37:35.840" style="s2">face right</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.000" end="01:37:39.520" style="s2">and yeah and i think with what part of</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.760" end="01:37:40.639" style="s2">the answer is i mean like i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.520" end="01:37:42.239" style="s2">you know if there are people who think</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.639" end="01:37:43.360" style="s2">oh this is really culty or whatnot in</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.239" end="01:37:45.280" style="s2">the negative sense you know what</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.360" end="01:37:47.600" style="s2">i&#39;d certainly like to talk to them or i</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.280" end="01:37:49.119" style="s2">i my suggestion would be hey</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.600" end="01:37:52.560" style="s2">hang out and tell us what you think</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.119" end="01:37:55.840" style="s2">after that and if you have issues i mean</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.560" end="01:37:57.199" style="s2">if people have these negative ideas</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.840" end="01:37:59.280" style="s2">i i&#39;d like to know about them because</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.199" end="01:38:02.000" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s something we have to counter</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.280" end="01:38:02.719" style="s2">you know it may be there may be</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.000" end="01:38:03.920" style="s2">legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.719" end="01:38:06.320" style="s2">things i mean i think we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.920" end="01:38:09.679" style="s2">pretty good job of being very open</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.320" end="01:38:12.080" style="s2">and yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.679" end="01:38:13.440" style="s2">you know i think i know john is</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.080" end="01:38:15.760" style="s2">definitely like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.440" end="01:38:17.360" style="s2">very humble he doesn&#39;t want to be like</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.760" end="01:38:18.719" style="s2">the whole leader figurehead he wants</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.360" end="01:38:21.280" style="s2">other people involved</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.719" end="01:38:22.719" style="s2">part of our mandate is to you know go</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.280" end="01:38:23.920" style="s2">with other groups you know coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.719" end="01:38:26.880" style="s2">with other groups and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.920" end="01:38:29.199" style="s2">been trying to do as well</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.880" end="01:38:30.320" style="s2">you know be in conjunction with science</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.199" end="01:38:33.440" style="s2">which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.320" end="01:38:35.360" style="s2">very which is by definition</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.440" end="01:38:36.480" style="s2">dynamic you know because science is</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.360" end="01:38:39.119" style="s2">always changing</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.480" end="01:38:39.679" style="s2">so practices will always change if we</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.119" end="01:38:45.520" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.679" end="01:38:47.760" style="s2">be in accordance with the best science</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.520" end="01:38:49.199" style="s2">right i mean at this point i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.760" end="01:38:53.679" style="s2">this discord has</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.199" end="01:38:55.280" style="s2">a strong enough like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.679" end="01:38:56.400" style="s2">if people are responding that way then</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.280" end="01:38:58.320" style="s2">they&#39;re probably not going to get much</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.400" end="01:38:59.360" style="s2">out of the situation anyways well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.320" end="01:39:01.520" style="s2">what i&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s just people</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.360" end="01:39:03.360" style="s2">who just came in looked around and then</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.520" end="01:39:04.880" style="s2">left versus people who hung out for a</p>

<p begin="01:39:04.880" end="01:39:08.719" style="s2">who hung out for</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.000" end="01:39:10.239" style="s2">for a few days and then left because</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.719" end="01:39:11.600" style="s2">they thought it was culty versus</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.239" end="01:39:14.320" style="s2">someone who just came in and sniffed</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.600" end="01:39:16.560" style="s2">around right in the initial</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.320" end="01:39:18.960" style="s2">so that yeah we should probably have a</p>

<p begin="01:39:36.480" end="01:39:44.159" style="s2">so um when i got out</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.000" end="01:39:48.080" style="s2">of that cult in the uk i was written</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.159" end="01:39:51.199" style="s2">i i found the checklist</p>

<p begin="01:39:57.280" end="01:40:03.760" style="s2">21 points which</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.639" end="01:40:06.800" style="s2">are like celtic like negative celtic</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.760" end="01:40:09.040" style="s2">structures usually have</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.800" end="01:40:10.480" style="s2">and this includes things like sleep</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.040" end="01:40:12.000" style="s2">deprivation and</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.480" end="01:40:15.280" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.000" end="01:40:19.440" style="s2">diet restrictions and</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.280" end="01:40:21.679" style="s2">like uh not like disorienting people by</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.440" end="01:40:24.639" style="s2">by not telling them what time it is</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.679" end="01:40:26.320" style="s2">this kind of stuff or like not been able</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.639" end="01:40:29.600" style="s2">to just leave physical premium</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.320" end="01:40:30.000" style="s2">premises so i can look that up but it</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.600" end="01:40:33.119" style="s2">sounds</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.000" end="01:40:37.440" style="s2">similar to nick&#39;s yellow</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.119" end="01:40:40.480" style="s2">red flag kind of system right</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.440" end="01:40:42.639" style="s2">so so i&#39;m saying and</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.480" end="01:40:44.000" style="s2">following up on this you mentioned this</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.639" end="01:40:47.119" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.000" end="01:40:51.840" style="s2">dichotomous like is it</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.119" end="01:40:51.840" style="s2">open isolated or is it open</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.080" end="01:40:56.320" style="s2">so i wonder what how would you assess</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.480" end="01:41:00.320" style="s2">what we do here</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.320" end="01:41:03.600" style="s2">on those measures because i feel</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.320" end="01:41:06.800" style="s2">this community is open and</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.600" end="01:41:08.480" style="s2">john is obviously a public figure and</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.800" end="01:41:10.639" style="s2">everyone can</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.480" end="01:41:12.159" style="s2">see what he&#39;s doing so there is nothing</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.639" end="01:41:16.000" style="s2">secret or</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.159" end="01:41:17.280" style="s2">kind of unsavory going on behind closed</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.000" end="01:41:20.320" style="s2">doors</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.280" end="01:41:23.040" style="s2">no yeah i would say this is very</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.320" end="01:41:23.760" style="s2">open and then there&#39;s pseudo boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.040" end="01:41:26.960" style="s2">formed from</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.760" end="01:41:29.679" style="s2">investment cost right</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.960" end="01:41:30.800" style="s2">investment in this case being a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.679" end="01:41:33.600" style="s2">time and</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.800" end="01:41:35.840" style="s2">brain power to understand that you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.600" end="01:41:37.480" style="s2">for reiki&#39;s lecture and</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.840" end="01:41:40.080" style="s2">where he&#39;s coming from that</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.480" end="01:41:44.639" style="s2">contextualizes the server</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.080" end="01:41:47.920" style="s2">um that that&#39;s not a real boundary</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.639" end="01:41:48.800" style="s2">the only other point would be that</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.920" end="01:41:51.119" style="s2">consumptive</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.800" end="01:41:52.480" style="s2">aspect of like how much does the</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.119" end="01:41:54.920" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.480" end="01:41:57.119" style="s2">use the tools available to it to</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.920" end="01:41:59.360" style="s2">contextualize the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.119" end="01:42:01.040" style="s2">um right is it isolating away from the</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.360" end="01:42:03.440" style="s2">world and trying to escape</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.040" end="01:42:04.239" style="s2">reality or is it dealing with it</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.440" end="01:42:06.080" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.239" end="01:42:08.639" style="s2">and in that regard i would also say it</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.080" end="01:42:12.000" style="s2">has a pretty high</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.639" end="01:42:12.880" style="s2">status of interfacing with the world as</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.000" end="01:42:14.719" style="s2">it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.880" end="01:42:16.560" style="s2">largely through the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.719" end="01:42:19.280" style="s2">verveiki has with</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.560" end="01:42:20.639" style="s2">guests and then also the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.280" end="01:42:23.600" style="s2">we have here</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.639" end="01:42:25.760" style="s2">well it&#39;s also baked into the the</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.600" end="01:42:26.000" style="s2">ecology of practices themselves which</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.760" end="01:42:29.360" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.000" end="01:42:32.320" style="s2">designed not to give you the answer</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.360" end="01:42:33.119" style="s2">but to help you be better able to figure</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.320" end="01:42:35.679" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.119" end="01:42:36.320" style="s2">your answers to figure out what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.679" end="01:42:39.360" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.320" end="01:42:40.800" style="s2">in your life and rather than saying</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.360" end="01:42:42.719" style="s2">this is the thing that&#39;s relevant for</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.800" end="01:42:45.840" style="s2">everybody you should all do this</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.719" end="01:42:48.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.840" end="01:42:50.000" style="s2">teaching you how to have maybe have more</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.560" end="01:42:52.960" style="s2">chances of being</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.000" end="01:42:53.280" style="s2">of having insight or or being able to</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.960" end="01:42:56.400" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.280" end="01:42:57.600" style="s2">you know break frame you know better to</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.400" end="01:42:59.440" style="s2">problem solve better</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.600" end="01:43:00.800" style="s2">so rather it&#39;s not giving you the answer</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.440" end="01:43:03.679" style="s2">it&#39;s giving you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.800" end="01:43:06.080" style="s2">a way to help get you better answers on</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.679" end="01:43:06.080" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.159" end="01:43:13.360" style="s2">yeah i mean part of that i would say is</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.199" end="01:43:15.520" style="s2">a good move and part of it i think is</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.360" end="01:43:15.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.639" end="01:43:20.080" style="s2">that might be a byproduct of having an</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.520" end="01:43:22.639" style="s2">extraordinarily small</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.080" end="01:43:22.639" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.520" end="01:43:27.360" style="s2">when it gets to the point of like</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.000" end="01:43:28.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between this</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.360" end="01:43:31.040" style="s2">discord</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.080" end="01:43:32.639" style="s2">and a legitimate retina and when you get</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.040" end="01:43:34.080" style="s2">into the question of like what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.639" end="01:43:37.360" style="s2">legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.080" end="01:43:38.639" style="s2">uh you know religious religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.360" end="01:43:40.960" style="s2">not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.639" end="01:43:44.639" style="s2">um i i think a lot of what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.960" end="01:43:49.119" style="s2">about here will be a lot more prevalent</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.639" end="01:43:49.119" style="s2">or more relevant</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.199" end="01:43:56.000" style="s2">things to contend with</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.480" end="01:43:57.760" style="s2">yeah you know so we&#39;re coming up to the</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.000" end="01:43:59.840" style="s2">end but jay david&#39;s had a couple</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.760" end="01:44:01.760" style="s2">questions on on</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.840" end="01:44:03.760" style="s2">sort of the religion it&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.760" end="01:44:04.880" style="s2">maybe should it be have curriculum and</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.760" end="01:44:08.239" style="s2">exams and</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.880" end="01:44:11.840" style="s2">prerequisites and admission criteria</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.239" end="01:44:13.280" style="s2">and you know i think john&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.840" end="01:44:16.080" style="s2">eventually at least for some of his</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.280" end="01:44:18.000" style="s2">things to have i mean he&#39;s doing courses</p>

<p begin="01:44:18.000" end="01:44:21.119" style="s2">meeting crisis kind of of course</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.600" end="01:44:22.719" style="s2">he&#39;s doing the meditation course there</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.119" end="01:44:24.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t exams but</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.719" end="01:44:26.239" style="s2">i mean eventually i guess they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.960" end="01:44:28.480" style="s2">know you could have</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.239" end="01:44:29.440" style="s2">actually you know classes and teachers</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.480" end="01:44:32.080" style="s2">you know teaching</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.440" end="01:44:34.080" style="s2">the ecology of practices and people</p>

<p begin="01:44:34.080" end="01:44:37.840" style="s2">hours or skills to to pass</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.400" end="01:44:47.199" style="s2">yeah yeah this is probably more</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.040" end="01:44:48.560" style="s2">this is like getting more hands-on in</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.199" end="01:44:51.920" style="s2">terms of like</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.560" end="01:44:51.920" style="s2">community development</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.360" end="01:45:02.560" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s yeah it is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.639" end="01:45:04.960" style="s2">you were bringing up the aspirant&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.560" end="01:45:08.400" style="s2">that might be like you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.960" end="01:45:09.040" style="s2">watched whatever x amount of time of his</p>

<p begin="01:45:09.040" end="01:45:12.480" style="s2">and have a clear idea of the ideas being</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.280" end="01:45:14.840" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.480" end="01:45:16.000" style="s2">and practitioner where people are</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.840" end="01:45:18.239" style="s2">regularly</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.000" end="01:45:19.520" style="s2">you know participating in the ecology of</p>

<p begin="01:45:44.000" end="01:45:47.840" style="s2">and then i would also make sure to say i</p>

<p begin="01:47:15.600" end="01:47:20.159" style="s2">conversation</p>

<p begin="01:47:25.440" end="01:47:28.960" style="s2">and whether you call it a cult or not we</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.360" end="01:47:32.239" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be a bad cult</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.960" end="01:47:35.760" style="s2">and right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.239" end="01:47:38.320" style="s2">yes i try to make it clear like i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.760" end="01:47:40.000" style="s2">advocating that everything calls itself</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.320" end="01:47:42.199" style="s2">occult</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.000" end="01:47:43.440" style="s2">i i&#39;m trying to advocate for like a</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.199" end="01:47:46.639" style="s2">sociological</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.440" end="01:47:47.119" style="s2">lens that pushes a little bit closer</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.639" end="01:47:49.840" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.119" end="01:47:50.880" style="s2">our phenomenology so it&#39;s it&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.840" end="01:47:53.119" style="s2">trying to incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.880" end="01:47:54.159" style="s2">honesty as an ideal when dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.119" end="01:47:56.320" style="s2">sociology</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.159" end="01:47:57.520" style="s2">and then playing with it from there i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.320" end="01:47:59.199" style="s2">not saying like</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.520" end="01:48:00.560" style="s2">this is what it is so everyone should</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.199" end="01:48:02.719" style="s2">call itself that</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.560" end="01:48:04.639" style="s2">but being aware that you are dealing</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.719" end="01:48:08.320" style="s2">with cultic structures</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.639" end="01:48:08.880" style="s2">i think is important well thank you</p>
