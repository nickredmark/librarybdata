<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">in terms of predicting this and to hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">that you are surprised</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">i must say um i i can&#39;t be terribly</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">surprised at what has happened but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">certainly surprised at the speed with</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">which it is happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">exactly so in an original article in</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">2015 we were predicting that there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">going to be an increase in anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">and you know we thought it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">modestly measurable</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">you know little thing on a graph it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">like oh see here it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about uh you know graphs</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">that go off uh up like hockey sticks</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">when it comes to mental health so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">basically we saw a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">coming we didn&#39;t expect it to come like</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">next year</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s interesting i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">is that sounds like caused us both to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">caught off guard by the speed what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">is there an accelerant in here that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">might have</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">might have perceived if we had looked at</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">it um you know definitely social media</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">has sped</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">everything up it&#39;s sped up polarization</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">it spread up sorting it sped up mental</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">health issues you know we</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">we argue in the book at least but</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">definitely i&#39;d say trump</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">um i i feel like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">the ridiculous political era we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">has sped up</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">all the pro all of the uh political</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">processes we talked about in cuddling</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">the american mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">because one of the things we did did say</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">that was one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">generation z was so different was</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">because the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">politically was hotter than ever and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">that just went</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">um through the roof in 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">yeah it really did go um through the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">roof now</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">you of course focused in coddling</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">on the degree to which online dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">do amplify these processes so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">uh come out of nowhere that that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">definitely a big part of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">model and i did write something in 2014</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">uh called freedom from speech</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">which talked about how i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">as other</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">and the thing is you know ultimately in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">a lot of ways i&#39;m a i&#39;m a steve pinker</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">optimist</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">i i would rather live now than 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">you know i&#39;m excited about space</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">elevators and carbon nanotubes and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">the all</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">and having nanites in my blood and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">that kind of stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">but one thing that i i did want to add</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">some nuance to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">the argument of things getting better</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">which was really almost like there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">sugar high in the early part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">uh of the teens um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">that there are some things that get</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">worse precisely because other things are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">getting better</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">so technological advantage advancements</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">that let you live</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">um in communities that reflect your</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">values or even find those communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t live close to them</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">you know that that sounds lovely um but</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">also as</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">you know everything from you know uh</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">already described but i have the sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">that the online</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">environment that what we have in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">seen is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">a phase transition where we are now</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">dealing with a critical mass of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">for whom the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">online environment is primary</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">and the online environment is of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">not actually primary but if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">mistake it as primary</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">it might result in certain dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">i think we are now seeing unfold</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">so in short what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">is if i&#39;m having a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">evolutionary biologists</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">online if i&#39;m in a chat about</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">presumably i have the right or we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">to exclude young earth creationists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">not that they don&#39;t have the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">to speak about young earth creationism</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">but if we are to have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">talk about evolutionary biology anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">there has to be a place where we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">simply say actually we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">entertain</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">young earth creationism here and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">that right whatever it is made of looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">like it has been extrapolated to all</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">sorts of things where it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">belong so for example uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">online we are told that if one</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">has any skepticism about the claim</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">that a man who declares himself a woman</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">is in fact a woman upon that declaration</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">if we have any doubts about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">then we are we are turfs we are trans</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">exclusionary radical</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">feminists and therefore we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">committed a sin</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">a grave right wrong yeah a grave moral</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">wrong and we are to be driven out</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">and so i have the sense that this i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious nonsense i&#39;m a biologist i</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">the fact that you may declare yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">female doesn&#39;t make you female and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">you know we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">agree that that&#39;s the way you should be</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">treated but it doesn&#39;t change certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">underlying biological realities</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">nonetheless if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">people see the internet as a space in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">which they are allowed to establish this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">rule in the same way that i as an</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">evolutionary biologist might establish</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">the rule</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">that young earth creationism is isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">be discussed in this you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">in this subreddit or whatever that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">would get this behavior where the point</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">is you have to exclude those who violate</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">the rule in order that the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">can progress as normal i i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">a lot of truth to that and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">it is a lot where my head is about two</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">to two different things</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">um the first is that one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">why i think things have gotten so hot</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">in 2020 in terms of hyper polarization</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">and ideology</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">run wild is that because of covet</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">because we&#39;re home all the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">we have become our avatars we&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">our online personality</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">24 hours a day and without face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">contact without the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">you know the rigmarole of daily life um</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">people in their avatars</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">they&#39;re uh much less reasonable they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">much more ideologically pure they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">much braver of course because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">actually um you&#39;re not actually facing</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">uh people so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing the distortion of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">hap because at first i remember like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">during covet it was kind of nice to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">everybody online you know it was like</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">and we all spent way more time online it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">was like hi everybody how are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">there was this kind of honeymoon period</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">and then that weird kind of spiral of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">of ideology took over but here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">here&#39;s the least</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">probably popular or on pc thing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">probably going to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">is that i feel like what&#39;s happened to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">our entire society</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">is that tactics for winning arguments in</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">dormitories in the night</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">and and and in departments in the 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">have become treated as if they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">the law of solomon um that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">essentially you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">any dissent from uh from theories of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">privilege</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">um any dissent from theories about uh</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">they&#39;re serious about sexual identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s just a great moral sin</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">um and that doesn&#39;t have to be have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">be discussed but all these things they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">weren&#39;t meant to actually be true</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">they were supposed to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">rhetorical advantage in arguing but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">know if you do assume</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">they&#39;re 100 true i mean that was one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">the reasons why you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">this goes beyond what fire does but why</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">i was concerned about the 1619 thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">is because the the 16 19 argument the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">argument that it&#39;s all was only ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">just about slavery and nothing else was</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">something that you would hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">on campus sometimes and it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">uh debated uh as as it should be</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">but then it just got treated suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">just in the past couple</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">of what was it was it was that this year</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">that that came out uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">i believe it was about a year ago a long</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">year wow</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">yeah so but that argument got</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">being treated as if it was gospel fact i</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">was like wow okay we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:08.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve really we these arguments have won</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">but not not because they&#39;re true because</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">they&#39;re rhetorically useful</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">and taken for granted by a a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">group of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">former college students or current</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">college students</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">well i wonder if our models are about to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">converge here because</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">um the way i would they sound like they</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">yeah i think i think they&#39;re headed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">this direction so what what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">imagining</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">is that people from</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">our generation and uh am i right</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">gen x yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">yes we should we should those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">still remain</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">in this tiny generation should gather</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">for a reunion at some point but</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">um so what i&#39;m imagining is that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:53.880" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">our generation and those above are</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.880" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">misunderstanding something about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">arguments that are being</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">deployed because they come couched</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">as arguments about matters of fact which</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">is very confusing</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">right but in fact what i suspect they</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">is gambits in a negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">that in effect if you take my model that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">basically there is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">a generation or several generations now</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">are playing with the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2">online environment is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">in some sense deeper truer more real</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">and you know i can still man that point</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">although it&#39;s obviously wrong in the end</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">but right</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">if you imagine that people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:41.560" style="s2">proceeding from that starting point</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">then there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.560" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">establishing</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">the rules of that environment going</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">and if you believe as i do and i would</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">presume you do that the u.s for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">is not perfectly fair with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">race that there are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">historical biases that echo through to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">modernity then the point is well those</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">need to carry no weight</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">online right we can actually neutralize</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">yep for real and it&#39;s not that difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">what we do is we set out the rules</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">by which online discussion proceeds and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">you can see this in the case of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">gender question</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">because at some level if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">how you are to be treated online if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">say you&#39;re a woman</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">you&#39;re a woman right that&#39;s plausible</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">it becomes implausible when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">see your doctor</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">right or when you commit a crime and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">have to decide which prison to send you</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">or we have to decide whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">can enter a race in</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">a women&#39;s category rather than compete</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">against men</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">but online there&#39;s no need for any of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">those things to be relevant we</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">can just simply decide the sexes are</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">equal</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">you are what you say you are let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">and so we can neutralize issues of class</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">neutralize issues of race we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">neutralize issues of gender</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">online and that when we are told</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">that uh if i say well no</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">there&#39;s an issue of gamete size that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:13.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no amount of surgery that can</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">correct for it and it has implications</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">right i&#39;ve just said something i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s controversial at a biological</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">but if i say that online then the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">is i have to be punished because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">violated the proposed rule and that in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">effect the vast pylon of people who will</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">call me a turf</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.519" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">are really basically enforcing</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">the new rules of how of essentially</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">etiquette of how we are to interact</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">in the online environment so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">then the problem comes that the outside</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">world actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">is primary it is real and they wish to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">export sure it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">well if you&#39;re gonna push me to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">philosophy i&#39;ll say we cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">perfectly certain but it would be uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">it would be uh pointless to to worry</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">about it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">1619 is effectively the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">online rules right in which we are to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">treat we have been told that we are to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">treat the united states as if</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">it was exclusively about slavery that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">100 of the project we are to treat that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">as real</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">i would argue as some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">compensation right that there has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">a historical blindness to the importance</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">and so now there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">compensatory over emphasis that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">rules of the online environment but</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">they&#39;re now being exported into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">world we&#39;re now going to teach them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">children as fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">yeah right rather than them being the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">rules of the discussion online</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">yeah and one last wrinkle on it is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">uh place</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">that uh i you know heights</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">uh his primary area of scholarship is on</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">what&#39;s called moral foundations which</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you know all about</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:55.759" style="s2">and you know when we were working on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">book i was asking are you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.759" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">some of this ideology is an analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">religion or is taking the place of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">religion and he says</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">it&#39;s taking the place of religion flat</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">out um and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">that so some of these rules that because</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">they have this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">moral heat behind them that basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">your brain is supposed to shut off if</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">they&#39;re violated</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">it really like like the word used before</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">it really does</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">have all the markings of of sin</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">yeah it does and then i would uh add</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">my evolutionary wrinkle to uh to your</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">work and john&#39;s work here and i would</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">say the problem is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">functioning</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">as a literal religion but without the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">that religion brings to the table that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">makes it more or less safe</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">forgiveness and mercy uh no but these</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">would be downstream products of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">it would be the fact that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">religion if it&#39;s a true religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s long standing right so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">know it&#39;s not riddled with fatal errors</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">it may be riddled with untruths oh nice</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">okay yeah i get it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">so at some level what we&#39;re facing are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.959" style="s2">is the invention of a new religion and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">there is no one alive who can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.959" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t end in gulags or gas chambers</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">or starvation</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">or you know nuclear exchange we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">know what happens because this one is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a prototype yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">know it&#39;s playing with all of the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">important tools we&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">it sweep through you know governance</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">which means that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">you know the nuclear regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">commission is dealing with the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">you know presumably fission</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">is a process born of white supremacy or</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:37.919" style="s2">right so that&#39;s very dangerous oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of funny because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">we&#39;re both left-leaning people</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">and and that&#39;s and we you know i i used</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:44.720" style="s2">to work at this program called the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">environmental project in the 90s we</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">worked with inner city high school kids</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">to do environmental justice work</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve i got all my democrat</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">friends together back in 2003 to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">listen</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">really what we should be focusing on is</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">and to see you know my side of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">spectrum actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">um we care about new we care about um</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">global warming but we want to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">fracking and no nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like are you serious about this and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">and that gets treated like it like an</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">uh like an article of faith and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">all arguing</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">with the same kind of one-upsmanship and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">and grandstanding that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">argue in dorms yes now you and i might</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">come out different places</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">on fracking and fission</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but yeah nonetheless i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">love to be spending</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">astronomical amounts of money on fusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">um to be clear oh me too</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">that that&#39;s exactly where i think we</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">should be investing and it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">need some upgraded kind of vision to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">us there because we don&#39;t know when</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">right and just for now it&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">the other options</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">and we&#39;re not gonna we&#39;re not gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">to where we need to be but the but</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">really i think we should be spending</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">apollo project type money on fusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">i agree i&#39;ve i have argued we need a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">manhattan project for fusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">um because it&#39;s actually the one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">the one technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">that i think plausibly saves us going</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">forward that said</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">i think if we do if we invented it today</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">if it got announced this afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">it would make things worse not better</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">yeah i can actually think of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">ways or at least we&#39;d just</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">figure out a way to argue ourselves out</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">of it i mean this this has already</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">started happening with some of the um</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">uh super carbon materials like that i</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">got excited about you know like i was</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">amazed at how fast people were talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">about you know the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">particulate matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">you know to to um be very harmful to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">people&#39;s lungs</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">but as if that&#39;s why we shouldn&#39;t pursue</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">it it&#39;s like this could be this could</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">change everything this gives a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">you know um if we have this can&#39;t we try</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">that issue you know later well we and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it&#39;s like the precautionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">principle that they have uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">you know currently in the european union</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">which is just which is just a formula</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">stagnation and not being able to fix any</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">of the problems you currently have</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">well so uh heather i have a book that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.679" style="s2">will be coming out</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">uh next year oh tell me and it is going</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.679" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">include in it the argument that we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:08.480" style="s2">version of the precautionary principle</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">but that the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.480" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">precautionary principle is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">everything depends on how you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">instantiate it because</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">if you instantiate it narrowly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">right you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">bring everything to a halt because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">can&#39;t be totally certain of the safety</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">of anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">sure um so anyway there&#39;s a i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a more sophisticated way</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">um to pursue it but yes it is something</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">we would have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.039" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">agree to broadly and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">you know you&#39;re an interesting person to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">be talking to about this because</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">uh it is i think clear to both of us</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">that we are actually watching a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">dangerous breakdown in civilization</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">that is in some ways the downstream uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">consequence of new technologies whose</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">danger we didn&#39;t anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">do you mean you mean specifically social</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">well i mean you know social media</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">i mean feed algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">search algorithms i mean focus</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">groups and the ability to predict</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">and to modify it with sophisticated uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">propaganda all of these technologies</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">have caused a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">um a breakdown in our sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">and in our sense of allegiance to each</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously at one level the root</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">of the problem which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">uh part of the argument you deploy in in</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:36.559" style="s2">coddling</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">yeah um so how do you square that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">with your sense about the precautionary</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">principle was there a place where we</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">needed to look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">what was unfolding and say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">this could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">so dangerous that we have to put the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">brakes on it in some way um</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">you know if we had a precautionary</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">principle for social media like</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">let&#39;s say that was part of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">already social media still would have</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">gone ahead because</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">really people didn&#39;t see any harm in it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh you show cap pictures and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">hey you get pat on the back for</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">um for what group you&#39;re in i i think i</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">think even a strong version of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">still would have led to the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">twitter and facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">um the sorting algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">and of course you know since i&#39;m a civil</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.080" style="s2">liberties guy um you know i think in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">terms of um</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.080" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">my biggest fear of course is is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">centralized power um</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">and so when i was working on the book</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">with height when we were finishing up</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">our recommendation sections for social</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">media you know he he definitely had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">lot more faith in top-down</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">um solutions but i know what top-down</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">solutions are going to look like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">going to be you know the president of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">princeton uh shouldn&#39;t pick on princeton</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">actually no they did the job you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">the professor pat&#39;s thing was actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">pretty bad um and it always turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">be whatever is in the interest of power</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:48.559" style="s2">um that&#39;s the thing that gets banned and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">people say please</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.559" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">have more censorship to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">downtrodden it&#39;s like yes we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">that and now i&#39;m going to shut up my</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">critics</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">you know it is the way it works so my</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">hope is that we start developing um</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">cultural norms around</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">use of social media i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">really the only way out is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">is some process of developing norms</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">i i feel like i&#39;ve seen some glimmers of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">reasonability</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">in little enclaves on twitter or on</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">facebook for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m just completely uh completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">spoiled um</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">so i i don&#39;t think there i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">the precautionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">principle wouldn&#39;t have known far enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">into the future what the downside would</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">have been meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">i you know and this is something i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">been saying for a long time but i still</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">really think it twitter is the closest</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">to looking at the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">um the human mind works of probably any</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">technology that&#39;s ever been</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">developed and what&#39;s better is or</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">better in the sense of more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">is that it&#39;s immediate and it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">hundreds of millions of people so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">kind of like looking into the collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">unconscious of the entire species</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">and if that doesn&#39;t get people excited</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">as a research opportunity you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">nicholas christakis and i have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">friends ever since</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">actually since well before the incident</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">at yale</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">but he gets really excited about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">stuff too and and there&#39;s so much to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">about human nature and tribalism and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">from this technology um if we can just</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">survive its initial</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">impact i feel like we&#39;re in the period</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">you know sometimes people will say oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">luke lukianov and height you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">people said the same thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">printing press and it&#39;s like you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">chose a bad example there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">because it led to you know hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">years of religious war um became pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">much directly out of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">so i think right now we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">religious war i just hope it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">right or fatal to the species that would</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">be bad that would be unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">um but all right so this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">you are you are hostile to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">of um structures that would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">and i agree would be abused by people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">shut down their critics i mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">already seeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">this um i i would challenge your sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">about a view into the collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">okay great because i believe twitter</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">would be that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">if twitter were an unmanaged platform</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s more like the superego now no</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">since there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">powerful norms it&#39;s just the way we talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">it is downstream of many things but one</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">is twitter&#39;s perverse incentives yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">you&#39;re right right and so the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:31.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">a glimpse into the unconscious of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.720" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">propagandized person</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">right we are a propagandized population</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">what we think on twitter is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">heavily edited not just by our</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">distorted fear of a pylon right</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">right the fact that a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">piling on you in an ugly way</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">is enough to dissuade you for from</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">saying something when in fact 100</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">or for leaving the house right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">exactly but the point is the the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">people pile on</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">and the way people have now organized</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">themselves to pile on more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">to modify what gets said is a distortion</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">the view into the unconscious and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">there&#39;s twitter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">obnoxious policy of deciding</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">um you know for example that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">um covid19 that sars cove</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">ii is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">that the consent the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">consensus that it is a natural virus</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">that emerged</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">from bats is so secure that we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">declare</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">anything that doesn&#39;t adhere to this</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">consensus</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">as um a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">um unforgivable thought that it will</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">label things</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">yeah right um what that does is it tamps</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;ve got lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">who are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">the facts even just the basic facts and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">saying that doesn&#39;t add up and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">this other</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">hypothesis that does add up and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like we know enough to know</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">which origin it has yeah so well and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s kind of funny kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">the gateway drug to censorship in a lot</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">conspiracy theories and i take two</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">different approaches to that as being a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">free speech person who isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">bothered you know by this is one even if</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">they&#39;re false conspiracies move the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">world and it&#39;s important to know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">people really think full stop</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">this this is this is my free speech</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">radicalism it comes down to something</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">very simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s always important to know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">people really think period</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">and so for example like we would have</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">such a poor understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.840" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">of of where the anti-semitism came from</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">before world war ii if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">the the uh protocols of zion it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">being this huge</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:49.279" style="s2">you know uh uh fraud and hit</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">but understanding like people&#39;s paranoia</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.279" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">and superstitions all of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">it is is um is so incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">but also the other part is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">always a possibility that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">um and i mean given you know my family</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">had to flee the soviets you know um</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s just one conspiracy after the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">so this is funny brett</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.430" style="s2">that this room doesn&#39;t think i&#39;m here so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">i occasionally have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.430" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">well um maybe you should just take up uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">gesticulating as a more</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">central part of your communication</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">modality oh i&#39;m actually really tamping</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">it down right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">this is the one that i seem to do for</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">everything according to my wife</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s an atom or the galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">or you know like there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">that actually it&#39;s like well this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">going to happen and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">yeah i do it without even realizing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s arguments in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">yeah right there&#39;s a certain roundness</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">to that argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">there is a certain that was a favorite</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">law school professor uh said that one</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">trying to be nice um but but i thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">that was great</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">so let me uh take you back to two things</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">you just said here</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">cool um one i want to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">yes um because i feel like we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">the boat on this one</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">okay great there is a very obvious way</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">to deal with conspiracy theories and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">that is not to traffic in them</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">right but there&#39;s a way to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">possibility of true things</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">and it just so happens that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">most excellent system you could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">want for dealing with them which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">so i uh want to be very clear and i have</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">been very clear with my audience</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">that theory has a precise meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">means it has withstood</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">rigorous tests there should only ever be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">one theory at a time</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">right that is to say the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">natural selection is the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">natural selection because we have so</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">tested it and there is no competitor</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">right before it was tested it was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">and so i would say the responsible way</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">to deal with the conspiracy issue is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">these are hypotheses the fact that one</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">advances a hypothesis doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">even believe it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">right you can have all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">hypotheses this you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">our conversation could be taking place</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">a simulated universe i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">that&#39;s true but i do regard it as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">and to the extent that it makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">predictions it&#39;s testable so</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">so i think the point is we have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">sold a bill of goods we&#39;ve been led</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">into a dangerous territory by</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:24.320" style="s2">thinking in terms of conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">when in fact they are hypotheses they</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">make predictions and we can treat them</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">exactly as seriously as you would</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">a proposed scientific idea that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">been tested or</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">has you know given mixed results well</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">here&#39;s why you get in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">brad thought experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocacy are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">essential to the production of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">and i say this stuff on campus and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:49.760" style="s2">people are like what people have to take</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">the other side of different arguments</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">yeah actually ideally you&#39;d have someone</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">who actually believes the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">the argument because they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">know the most arguments for it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be able to um to defend</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">it but if not someone in your team</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">should pretend</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">that they are willing to throw out these</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">other hypotheses on what actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m seeing i&#39;m seeing a situation on</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">campus</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">where that&#39;s been sort of obliquely</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">threatened</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">and now it&#39;s being very directly</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">threatened we just had a case of st</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">where a prophet do you know do you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">this one brett i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">this is a this is a case where a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">professor was um in a history class was</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">um the colombian exchange you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">uh all the wonderful things that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">rest of the world got</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">from columbus&#39;s uh quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">discovering the new world</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">and of course that includes things as</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">basic as potatoes and tomatoes like</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">that alone would have made it an</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:45.679" style="s2">incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">exchange but this is a serious</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.679" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">historical question kind of like for all</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">the horrors that came out of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.960" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">um the triangle slavery and all this all</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">the the um</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">uh and and the murder and the exposure</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">to smallpox and all these horrible</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">things the question is you know was it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">worth it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:03.760" style="s2">any serious intellectual any serious</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">student should be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.760" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">huh you know and and puzzle through that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:08.480" style="s2">and come down be able to come down on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.480" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s treated in this case so much</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">that the professor was suspended um</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">at st john&#39;s and i think this i think he</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">still is um he was relieved from</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">and and i&#39;m seeing more and more cases</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">because a lot i saw a ton of cases for</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">whereas professors saying something on</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">twitter that would get them in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">absolutely a free speech issue</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">absolutely important but it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">closer and closer to the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">although you might know something about</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">that well yes i</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">it does seem to me i encountered</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">something a few years back i&#39;ll see if i</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">can remember what it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">yeah but okay so i totally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">this thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">is an essential tool right and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">ability to voice a thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">even an obnoxious thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">right is part and parcel of how</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">you know we do moral philosophy among</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">other things i mean trolley problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">right if you couldn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">trolley problems because you&#39;re killing</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">innocents well then you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">robbed of this important uh tool for for</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">the advancement of uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">of ethics yeah but um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">we um well i wanna i wanna take you back</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">to that second thing before we</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">lose the thread sure sure so you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">very skeptical about top-down</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">solutions to our online problem you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">agree that we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">dealing with very dangerous downstream</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">consequences of technologies that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">couldn&#39;t foresee the hazard</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">yeah as they were invented so that some</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">sort of precaution were it possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">might have saved us from that but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">conceivable precaution could have</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">existed um but here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">isn&#39;t the solution for online an</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">upgrade to our</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">constitutional protectionists that have</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">worked so well for speech in other</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">so like what would that look like well i</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">think it would look like exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">you have just described which is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">radical</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">commitment to keeping the space open to</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2">including obnoxious ones because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">consequence of trying to shut it down</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">and leaving only respectable ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">is unthinkably terrible on very short</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">time scales</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s been that&#39;s been my and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">people like david french&#39;s argument that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">essentially if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">start regulating speech guess what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">have this absolutely brilliant body and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m the obnoxious american my my</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">um and you know you&#39;re taught from a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">pretty early age not to go over there</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:46.879" style="s2">thinking your values are superior but i</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">totally break that norm when i go to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">other countries and talk about first</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">amendment</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">because i and and i have and what i</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">explain is i know you guys think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">nuts but</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">in this country you know any practically</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">any country in europe</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">you&#39;re going after speech because it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">someone finds it offensive</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">in our country one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">differences between us and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">is actually relatively small but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">that we have a bedrock principle that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">can never be</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">merely because someone finds it</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">offensive that doesn&#39;t make cultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">these norms change from period to period</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">they&#39;re different from from economic</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">class economic class from nation to</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">nation from men to women that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">in some cases so the principles that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">actually are</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">have been thought out by frankly some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">the best minds um in</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">in us history i mean you know oliver</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">wendell holmes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">louis brandeis were no were no slouches</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">on this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:36.079" style="s2">and that it presents this really</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">sensible body of of of law</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.079" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">um and actually philosophy and how you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">actually deal</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">deal with speech and i think that would</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">be ideal um</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">way to regulate speech to use those</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">standards regulate speech on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">i can&#39;t quite bring myself though to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">want to give up the freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">association</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">and expressive rights that these</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">companies have in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">but i do think that if there was if</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">there was a place that actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">applied these rules um it would be and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">applied them very</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">uh very firmly it would be a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">environment for one</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">um even though there&#39;d be some nastiness</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">of course to be expected</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">but the direction that um twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">facebook are currently going</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">i think that it&#39;s going to start looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">like the absurdities that you see</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">uh in in europe and and worse it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">to also</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">involve things and and you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">the reasons why nobody wants to even do</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">the thought experimentation what if this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">actually was a biological weapon well</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">because of the power</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">wealth and influence of china well</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">i should say just point of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">that it was a biological weapon is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">hypothesis it means oh no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">production</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">and i assume that and the funny thing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">i know people on the on the interwebs</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">would would be like well</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">he claimed this and i&#39;m like yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a i i totally understood his</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">hypothesis it&#39;s a hype well that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">the one</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">that so i personally believe um the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">robust hypothesis we don&#39;t have a theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">of its origin yet we really don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">but the most robust hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">is a lab leak but not a weapon yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">a virus that had picked up</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">capacities through what&#39;s called gain of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">function research</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">and then escaped presumably it infected</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">a worker and would have gotten out that</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">way um though that&#39;s not the only path</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">in any case these are competing</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">right i haven&#39;t seen any support yet for</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">bio-weapon hypothesis though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">hypothesis whether there&#39;s any evidence</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">for it or not the point is</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">right were it true it would it would uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">make certain predictions about the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">it behaved</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">well the whole time bomb aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">the ability to um transmit</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">asymptomatically and then you get wallet</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">by it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">um you know two weeks later is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">clever</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s definitely one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">why i think people think it you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">sometimes go to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">it being a weapon is it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">perfectly designed to spread</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">well i would say that&#39;s not a prediction</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">though that is an observation</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">of its nature which leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">hypothesis right it</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">could be a bio weapon in which case it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">would have to have other</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">features but but in any case i guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">my only point is it just so happens that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">the most robust system ever devised</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">i believe the most robust system</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">possible for figuring out what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s already the bedrock of western</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">why do we exclude conspiracies from</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">its application why do we leap to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">calling these things theories rather</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">than start with the idea that their</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">you know and you know to your point</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">about thought experiments</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">the beauty of this system is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:48.160" style="s2">a formal feature of it that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">that you are</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">and positing</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.079" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">predictions that would come from that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">explanation has nothing to say about</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">whether you believe it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">right in fact when you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">scientifically the right thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">to generate as many hypotheses to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">explain an observation as you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">and then test to see which of them is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">correct which means that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">simult you&#39;ve simultaneously advanced</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">mutually exclusive ideas that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:16.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">part of the nature of the work and so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">we simply brought the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">of this hypothetical deductive thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:25.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">questions of conspiracy and collusion</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.520" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">we free ourselves from the madness that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">happens when</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">you know even voicing a conspiracy is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">now taken to be an embrace of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">and that is taken to be a sign of some</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">sort of mental failure</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">yeah well and that&#39;s what i was getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">at by saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">what your problem is kind of jokingly</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">but it does seem that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">so much progress comes from us um</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">trying to get into our prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">you know basically kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">putting our assumptions to one side and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">trying to actually bring it forward</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">based on evidence and that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">um but it&#39;s really important to remind</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">everyone you know like that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">why you know rational thinking was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">radical idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">when it was proposed you know by by</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">greek thinkers or or buddhist thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">you know for example the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">the discernment you know as it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">in the buddhist buddhist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">because everything about human beings</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">almost everything pulls us against it</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">we&#39;re superstitious we&#39;re tribal</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">uh we&#39;re we&#39;re not good seeing our own</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">biases and blindness</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">all this kind of stuff but which also</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:29.599" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">a little digression but it&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.599" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">care a lot about it&#39;s funny in these</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">arguments that you see on campus is you</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">things that basically say we only</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">recently discovered this thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">called bias and by bias they mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">prejudice um</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of amazing though that</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.599" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">they put in the language of bias because</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">the constitution&#39;s about what do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">think separation of powers is about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">do you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">all of these things were partially</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">because we were lucky enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">founded as a country during a period</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">where there was a lot of rational</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">badly and well we make decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.359" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">therefore splitting things up and having</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">checks and balances and all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">stuff abs absolutely brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">well so when you said earlier that um</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">you depart from the the norms</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">by advocating for the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">uh our principles are superior i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">shy about this i mean and to me it seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">like another</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">empirical question i mean on the one</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">hand it is certainly true</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">that our system was counter-intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">on its founding and has spread yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">people have seen what it does and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">have embraced it in large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">yes so that suggests something about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">i would also argue that you know you to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">say whether it is superior or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">one has to identify a criterion that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">or several criteria that you are trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">but i think it would be hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">better than</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:01.680" style="s2">realized liberty right that to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">extent that a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.680" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">a fantastically capable creature</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">that can engage in insight innovation</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">compassion the creation of beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">all of these things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful when a system liberates</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">us to do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">and that therefore there is some basis</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">to judge our system</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">and um to the extent that there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">others out there that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">do very well on uh those</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">evaluations most of them are um</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">building on the prototype that was set</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">up here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s interesting because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">always been as someone who&#39;s like a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">fan of david hume and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">scottish enlightenment i&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">pretty hard on the romantics and i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">that a lot of the evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">of the world came out of the the post</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">you know the post enlightenment period</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">and i still think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">however um i have developed a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">of a soft spot in my heart</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">you know for what it must have been like</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">for those early days of liberty that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">basically kind of like what</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">what can i see about the beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">complexity of the world and about my own</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">if i&#39;m freed from a narrow expectation</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">of religious expectation of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">every single person in the world should</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">be like and i i get at an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">level how powerful that must have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:19.520" style="s2">and interestingly at the same time geez</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">interestingly at the same time we got to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.520" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">learn more about human nature because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">that so it ended up being this</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">interesting feedback loop the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">rationalists keep on kind of studying</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">but once they actually see what a full</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">flowering of humanity could look like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">with everybody from</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">you know walt whitman to oscar wilde</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">einstein</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">um we in this co-relationship of liberty</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">and learning</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">we got to learn a lot more about human</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">nature absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">now here i i actually have no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">you&#39;ll think of this but</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">my sense yeah well we&#39;ll see about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">so my sense is that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">founding structures of the u.s were</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">an absolutely brilliant prototype</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">flawed in many ways sure but every</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">prototype will be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">cynical and pessimistic at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">cynical and optimistic at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">well uh they had the correct tensions</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">identified for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t possibly have anticipated</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">the technological world</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">that these protectionists would need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">to function in and so in some sense i</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:24.720" style="s2">have the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">that as brilliant as the founding</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.720" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">documents are</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">that they are inadequate to our</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">modern puzzle that they point the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">direction to what problems we should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">but for example i think the founders</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">keenly aware of the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">um of malignant governance</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">they were not nearly frightened enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">the kinds of scaling effects that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">internet would bring about and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">that the kinds of power that they feared</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">might not be in governmental hands at</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">the point that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">um we faced the next battle with them</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">that they would be in private hands</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">which i think is the problem that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">were grappling with a moment ago about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">but but but to be clear in defense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">the of the founders one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">that they added besides</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">um tremendous optimism about human</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">nature and realism and pessimism about</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually liking groups</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">was flexibility was the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">actually change it and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">that you know no religion</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">you know would would allow for it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">like well we&#39;re kind of assuming we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">not right about everything and that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">epistemic humility they had from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to make it hard to change it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s not impossible uh to change it</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">to adapt to new uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">to new to new changes so they basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">anticipated the fact that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">possibly have known everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">um and uh allowed for changes just they</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">had to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">yeah it had to jump through a serious</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">hurdle and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">what is on us is that we&#39;re too partisan</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">divided to actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:54.720" style="s2">you know um to make any of that those</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.720" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">uh super majority type situations</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">they&#39;re basically impossible into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">current environment all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">two points one uh i agree with you about</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">their far-sightedness with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:07.920" style="s2">building in a self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">mechanism i still think we may have</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.920" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">outstripped the capacity of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">at least as it&#39;s understood and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge danger so i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">i you know we do effectively need</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">the upgraded constitution but we dare</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">not open the process that would create</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">it because it would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">a disaster if we would get so many</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">stupid things</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">got the dumbest amendments you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">seen in your yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">so the mechanism is uh is not up to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">challenge of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">but i do want to point out you might</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">wanna are you sitting down greg</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">better okay good now you could stand up</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">but you might want to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">something because what i&#39;m about to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">is so mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.520" style="s2">that uh it could result in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:54.839" style="s2">disequilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.520" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">the religions also have an update</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.839" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">capacity but it&#39;s an it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">evolutionary one</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">and so for example martin luther uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">nailing the 95 theses on the church door</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">results in a um well what in biology we</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">might call a speciation event</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">what in uh computer science we might</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">call a forking event</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">right and basically it creates a new</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">of christianity which then forks into a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">bunch of different versions of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">protestantism</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">and the point is sectarian disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">over how things are to be understood</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">what traditions are to be held which</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">ones are to be jettisoned</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">that is the fodder that selection</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">on and what we see is</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">religions are constantly in battle to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">you know you know does your version of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">listen to the pope or not right you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">keep your catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">but you jettison the pope and you become</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">you know the greek orthodox church or</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">so become american catholics well</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">american and that would be one of many</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">different versions</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">where you know the book is the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">atheist by the way raised catholic just</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">picking on your own people then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">it was at least forgivable until five</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">minutes ago i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">within the rules</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">but uh but in any case yes the update</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">mechanism is different</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">in the constitutional case the founders</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">gave us</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">a conscious mechanism for intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">the structure in the religious case what</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">we have is an evolutionary and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">unconscious mechanism for update um but</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">i would argue they amount to something</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">very similar mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">interesting yeah i i like it um have you</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">have you had jonathan rausch on your</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">show no not yet he&#39;s coming out with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">book um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">awesome and i&#39;m totally jealous of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">it&#39;s called the constitution of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">you know like the some of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">you were describing before it just made</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">me think of his theory of liberal</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">um just the idea um and i think it</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">deserves theory rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">hypothesis in this case uh just just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:10.960" style="s2">the enlightenment produced a system for</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">uh deciding things it&#39;s not quite the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">scientific method actually you could</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">kind of include the scientific method as</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">a subpart of liberal science</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">um and it&#39;s you know something that he</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">wrote in his 1993 book kindly</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">inquisitors</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">um but he&#39;s really expanding on that now</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">and what i like is he&#39;s taking on both</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">you know uh academia and journalism you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">with a left-facing uh threat but then</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">the epistemic disaster</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">that is the trump administration um uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">and he&#39;s he&#39;s taking it from both</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">directions i&#39;ve got i&#39;ve gotten to read</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">some of it so far and i think he&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:47.440" style="s2">it awesome</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">well uh so i&#39;m now speaking without</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.440" end="00:49:51.599" style="s2">knowledge of the topic on which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">we&#39;re talking but i would say uh it</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.599" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">sounds</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">i would argue that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">but that method is embedded in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">which you might call liberal science</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">the fact is many features of that larger</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">informal</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">agreement are essential for it to work</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">in other words nowhere in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">method will you see</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">the process by which um we</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">uh innovate our way out of a cul-de-sac</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">right it&#39;s not captured there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">captured in</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">the habits of mind and discussion</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">amongst the sorts of people who become</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.880" style="s2">fixated on</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">the way fields get stuck right and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.880" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">getting a field</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">unstuck is an unruly process in which</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">entertain all sorts of outlandish</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">most of which are simply wrong and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">end up finding some sort of uh path out</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">your off your local optimum onto a</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">higher peak yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">so anyway yes i i would love to see if</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">captured that and uh described it</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">properly i would love to see this sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">of expanded scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">understood well because frankly it only</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">does you so much good to teach students</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">you know uh observe or hypothesize</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">predict</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">test right that&#39;s part of it for sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">but it ain&#39;t the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:21.760" style="s2">by a long shot no absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">yeah so all right if we um maybe switch</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">topics just a little bit can i ask you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">uh you and i met in must be late 2017.</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">steeped in your way of thinking them</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">showing up at that conference and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">uh being stunned by it makes makes</p>

<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">um let me ask you though</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">so you and jonathan height had</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">done your initial article and you were</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">thinking very deeply about the hazard of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">what was taking place on college</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.480" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">campuses and you had formulated the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">igen the basically the internet</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">generation and the fact that they were</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">cognitively seemingly quite different</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2">from the generations that had preceded</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.920" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">at some point the evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">debacle happened yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">do you remember this was before we knew</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">do you remember your encounter</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">with that material and what you thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">in light of what you had</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">already imagined was taking place this</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">uh and your debacle that was uh the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">spring of 2017</p>

<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">just before 10 in the morning wow um</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.520" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">i remember uh hearing about it and by</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">that point i was so</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">shocked and sad and jaded because you</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">know the milo riots which we cover in</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">some detail in the book i don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">what you think about milo yiannopoulos</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">but that was insane</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">and then we had you know the wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">alison stanger assaulted</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">you know defending a professor she</p>

<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">he had the surrounding of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">uh of the place where heather mcdonald</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">was speaking um at claremont mckenna</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">and so basically like when that started</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">happening to you</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">um i was already so sad and cynical um</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">but yeah i remember that being</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">especially outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">and wanting to and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:23.760" style="s2">because sometimes the cases that are the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">most spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.760" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">are the ones that fire gets very</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">cautious around because there just seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">to be too many moving parts and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">very serious about making sure we had</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">our</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.319" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">at the same time i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.760" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">if there was there was like except i i</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">something to the effect of it being the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.520" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">most dangerous i don&#39;t know that it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">i think it</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">it certainly was um the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">colorful and i you know it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">it was kind of comprehensive because it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">it just included</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">you know because you even had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:28.559" style="s2">backlash from right wingers you had</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">you know administrators showing acting</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.559" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">like administrators it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">it was it was like a symphony yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">had it all i think i think benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">boyce is actually writing a musical</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">about it which i think will be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the perfect way to do it i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">but yes it was it it was all inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">it had all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">the layers and the it had an obsession</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">with um documentation</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">mm-hmm right so i remember the canoe</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">meeting</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">yes yes the wonderful canoe meeting so</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">that is the one of the weirdest</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">saddest it it and and the administration</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">in so many cases they acted</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">really like and i don&#39;t mean this i mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">this in very literal sense like children</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">or like cult members who have been</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">reduced to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">infantilized state</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">but as i was sitting in that meeting i</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">was having this</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">this uh i wouldn&#39;t say despondent but it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">was next door to the feeling of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">despondent sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:32.240" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t think i was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">able to explain</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">the absurdity of the situation to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">right i thought that it was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">impossible for me to</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">even i was even concerned i wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">able to explain it to heather right who</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">was only</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">a couple blocks away at the time and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">realized that they</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">evergreen had these very fancy they had</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">basically a television studio</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">and they were recording the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">and i thought oh no they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">record it but they&#39;re going to realize</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">how bad this makes them look and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">not going to release it is there</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">anything i can do to force them</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">to release it right and i was pondering</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:10.400" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.400" style="s2">and it turned out nope they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.400" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">realize at all what they had</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">filmed and they put it out and it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">thank goodness at least now i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">sound like a crazy person yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:22.079" style="s2">because it actually happened they caught</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.079" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">yeah yeah i had a similar situation</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">because i i was on a videotape nicholas</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:31.280" style="s2">christakis</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">um you are that was me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.280" end="00:57:36.880" style="s2">um in in the solomon quad wow</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:38.480" style="s2">leading by the way to like horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.880" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">kind of like conspiracy theories like</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.480" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">how did greg luchanov end up in this and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like well it&#39;s pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">um uh erica who i adore</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.040" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">and and nicholas had invited me to speak</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">there um i just</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s true i ended up in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:53.920" style="s2">firestorm kind of kind of shocked</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:55.440" style="s2">and so i i was videotaping it and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.920" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">reason why i released it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.440" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">was because there was at least a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.079" style="s2">other people videotaping it including</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">the yale daily news</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.079" end="00:58:03.280" style="s2">um and they should forever be ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.280" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">because i was told that night by someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">who worked for the news but was critical</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">of this that they were planning to</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">release the footage of the confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:14.640" style="s2">in a way that will make nicholas look</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">bad and i was like</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.640" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">okay i guess i have to post my video now</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">i posted the video showing him showing</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">absolutely amazing composure in the face</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">of such shoddy nasty treatment and</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">keeping in mind also they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">after his wife you know they were going</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">after his kids who were who</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">were there they asked his son</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.359" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">to sign a a denunciation of his mother</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">and he&#39;s still like somehow nicholas was</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">just amazing he he just uh he just held</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">it together</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:47.119" style="s2">and so yeah for a very different reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">like they they they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.119" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">the yale daily news refused to put</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">anything up because they</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">they thought it made the students look</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:55.119" style="s2">bad but of course it made them look bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">because</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">revealing was not the rest of the world</p>

<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:19.119" style="s2">anybody to editorialize about it it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">self-evident what was going on and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.119" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">had a lot of elements of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">you know cult and bullying and uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">this really heavy coercion and obviously</p>

<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">thank goodness at least that it has</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">happened in a couple places where</p>

<p begin="00:59:46.559" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">hard to convey</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">um what was really going on there and</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">that was something that was</p>

<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">and then you know we should have watched</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">what we asked for because we got it</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">um but so we suddenly have this</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:01:00.160" style="s2">um yeah and i think that one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">they weren&#39;t expecting though was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">fact that since you could actually see</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">some of this it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">it it didn&#39;t look as as good on film as</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">as they thought it did</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">or it did in the venues that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">you know if they were playing to an</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">online audience that they knew</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">then these looked like wins but they</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">couldn&#39;t help but it being broadcast to</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">a larger world that understood it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.680" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">way off yeah something like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">oh and while we still have some time i</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:38.640" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">but we try to also be creative about it</p>

<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">for our uh for the individual incidents</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">cases where students get in trouble</p>

<p begin="01:02:22.640" end="01:02:25.359" style="s2">just a labor of love by non-filmmakers</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">but it</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.200" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment when when this idiot is</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">is organizing this nazi rally where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">just kind of there&#39;s little things wrong</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.720" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">into a disgrace</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.480" end="01:03:17.359" style="s2">like it&#39;s absolutely comedic when you</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">get to see what this guy looks like in</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.359" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">real life</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s called the mighty ira and</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:23.760" style="s2">and we&#39;re really psyched about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:25.280" style="s2">awesome i am definitely going to check</p>

<p begin="01:03:29.440" end="01:03:35.039" style="s2">cure for uh obnoxious speech is to let</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">it be aired so people can see what it</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.039" end="01:03:38.799" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:40.799" style="s2">is and yeah unfortunately you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">very clear that this era in which</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.799" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">um censorship is back with a vengeance</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">uh is also an era in which we are losing</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">agreement on the most basic stuff you</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">know whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">two plus two equals four whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.280" end="01:03:58.000" style="s2">men and women are different like we we</p>

<p begin="01:03:58.000" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">the ability to agree on anything and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:03.920" style="s2">think people do not fully appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">danger of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.920" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">yeah no i i it it worries me</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:10.799" style="s2">um and yeah i remember when people were</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:12.720" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.799" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">oh well you know when these students get</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.720" end="01:04:15.920" style="s2">to the real world</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">that&#39;ll straighten them out and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">definitely saying from the very</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">beginning it&#39;s like well no if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:21.839" style="s2">enough of them they&#39;ll change the real</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">world into a very strange place</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.839" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">and what&#39;s what drives me nuts is that i</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">hate and i have people who are</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">in charge of um all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.880" style="s2">companies come to us</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:34.799" style="s2">and say it&#39;s like listen we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.880" end="01:04:37.119" style="s2">crop from this elite school</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.799" end="01:04:37.920" style="s2">um or these elite schools and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.119" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.920" end="01:04:42.319" style="s2">like things that used to be just</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:45.200" style="s2">interpersonal tensions have turned into</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.319" end="01:04:46.079" style="s2">immediately going to human resources and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.200" end="01:04:47.920" style="s2">then like almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.079" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">complete parallelization of some</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.920" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">organizations but they always say</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.319" end="01:04:53.920" style="s2">but you can&#39;t say what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">organization this is um but it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.920" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">to bring</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s going to bring organizations down</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">it probably already has</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">you know what happened at the um at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:02.079" style="s2">new york times with james bennett that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:03.599" style="s2">was absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.079" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">this dynamic you know definitely there</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.599" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">were older uh older people as well who</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:09.359" style="s2">were against him</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:10.400" style="s2">but the whole dynamic of just the um you</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.359" end="01:05:12.240" style="s2">know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.400" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">if we can call you make a strong</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.240" end="01:05:15.280" style="s2">argument that somehow this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">and of course they rhetorically use the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.280" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">this is threatening our lives</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:20.319" style="s2">argument which is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">rhetorical uh card you can play</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.319" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">to get rid of a uh editor who was</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:26.559" style="s2">specifically hired</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">to try to rock the boat back in 2016 um</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.559" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">it&#39;s th this summer i hope that i</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:34.319" style="s2">feel like the fever is starting to break</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:36.240" style="s2">a little bit at least this current fever</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.319" end="01:05:38.079" style="s2">and that maybe things aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.240" end="01:05:39.760" style="s2">illiberal and scary as they were maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:42.319" style="s2">in say august</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.760" end="01:05:43.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to come back at some</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.319" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">point if we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.200" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">something about it well it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">come back and a lot is</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:49.760" style="s2">riding on the election and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">clear that either</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.760" end="01:05:56.240" style="s2">path actually addresses the issue but</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting that you see it as</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">possibly the fever having broken i</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:03.200" style="s2">hope that&#39;s the case i think we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">great deal of danger but</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.200" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">we uh we we are just that i i feel like</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:08.880" style="s2">there is at least</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:10.240" style="s2">um some amount of pushback that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.880" end="01:06:11.680" style="s2">seeing where people aren&#39;t immediately</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.240" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">getting fired for saying</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.680" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">you know what would have once been</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">considered mildly controversial stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:19.039" style="s2">yeah so you said it&#39;s going to bring</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:21.039" style="s2">down institutions</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:22.559" style="s2">i think if anything you&#39;re being too</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.039" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">cautious that</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.559" end="01:06:25.680" style="s2">uh at some level the game theory is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:29.200" style="s2">very clear</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.680" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">and to the extent that you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.200" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">different if you had universities</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:36.000" style="s2">with different commitments to wokeness</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">those that were woke</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.000" end="01:06:39.440" style="s2">would fail because they would be</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:42.079" style="s2">producing</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.440" end="01:06:43.760" style="s2">inferior graduates who were less capable</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">of thinking clearly about all the things</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:47.599" style="s2">that college is supposed to arm you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:48.799" style="s2">to think about but when every college</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.599" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">does it the point is</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.799" end="01:06:53.039" style="s2">everything downstream of those colleges</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:53.920" style="s2">is going to suffer those flaws which</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.039" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.920" end="01:06:59.760" style="s2">that the private sector firms that</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:03.039" style="s2">depend on those graduates</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.760" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">will be hobbled relative to any</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.039" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">presumably foreign competitors that</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:10.400" style="s2">similarly hobbled so effectively you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:13.280" style="s2">looking at everything</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.400" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">at the higher scales being jeopardized</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.280" end="01:07:18.000" style="s2">simultaneously which</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">ultimately means the nation will be uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.000" end="01:07:21.119" style="s2">rendered and capable of fending off its</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">competitors abroad which could</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">restructure</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">the way the whole planet functions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">frankly it could restructure</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:29.039" style="s2">the level of commitment to liberty that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.559" style="s2">the planet has because</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.039" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">the u.s has been bedrock to that</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.559" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">commitment to liberty yeah that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">funny you should say that because</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly one of the things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:39.359" style="s2">working on an article about right now</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.440" end="01:07:41.599" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.359" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">just by having an increasing incidence</p>

<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">you know papers being withdrawn and and</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">research really being seriously caught</p>

<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">skepticism about it because people are</p>

<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">stuff at home and it&#39;s ridiculously</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">why not do it in other places and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:05.520" style="s2">think that the um</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">the the downstream effects of american</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.520" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">higher education turning into</p>

<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:13.760" style="s2">globally will have</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.720" end="01:08:16.799" style="s2">very dire results for um the</p>

<p begin="01:08:21.520" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">at some level</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.880" end="01:08:27.359" style="s2">even if you acknowledge as you and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:31.120" style="s2">both did at the top of this discussion</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.359" end="01:08:33.359" style="s2">that there is uh plenty of inequity</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.120" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">in the us and that it is not evenly</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.359" end="01:08:36.719" style="s2">distributed the fact is</p>

<p begin="01:09:11.279" end="01:09:13.839" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:15.359" style="s2">that maybe the dust will have settled</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.839" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">and we&#39;ll be on to something</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.359" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">smarter than this by the time you need</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:20.640" style="s2">to send them into the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">well if something can&#39;t continue the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.640" end="01:09:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s going it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s uh yeah it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.000" end="01:09:28.480" style="s2">frightening thing you&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">but uh all right i want to ask you about</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.480" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">a couple last things before i let you go</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">great um so i want to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">the observation about the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.920" end="01:09:42.799" style="s2">of what we might have called social</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">justice warriors</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.799" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">back in 2015 what we might now call</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">uh wokeness um and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.120" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">the relationship of that belief system</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">to cognitive therapy</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">oh they&#39;re just completely incompatible</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">in what way</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:03.760" style="s2">well one of uh and it&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:05.679" style="s2">things you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.760" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">as i explained in my book i had anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.679" end="01:10:07.760" style="s2">and depression cognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:09.440" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.760" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">saved my life but as i was studying</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.440" end="01:10:12.719" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">it&#39;s particularly given what i did it</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">was blazingly obvious that campuses seem</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:17.520" style="s2">to be teaching</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">everybody to engage in these cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.520" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">distortions and this includes</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">binary thinking which is either or</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">thinking mind reading assuming that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:26.080" style="s2">know where someone is coming from</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">probably the biggest one is over</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.080" end="01:10:30.640" style="s2">generalization is a cognitive distortion</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:31.600" style="s2">and as you&#39;re teaching yourself all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.640" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">these um</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.600" end="01:10:35.840" style="s2">all these habits hold on again wow it</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">won&#39;t turn back on anyway</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.840" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">um as you&#39;re teaching yourself all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:42.000" style="s2">these uh habits</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:43.760" style="s2">particularly working on campus you it</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.000" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">was as if universities and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.760" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">administrators were saying</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:49.440" style="s2">do over generalize do engage in binary</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:51.120" style="s2">thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.440" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">and they are that&#39;s exactly what a lot</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.120" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">of this ideology comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:57.120" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s actually one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:10:58.640" style="s2">reasons why cbt has been shown to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.120" end="01:10:59.520" style="s2">somewhat less effective with this</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.640" end="01:11:01.600" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2">because there are too many dogmas that</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.600" end="01:11:05.760" style="s2">rely on over generalization</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:06.800" style="s2">require binary thinking catastrophizing</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.760" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.800" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">um so the two uh the the uh cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy and getting</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.159" end="01:11:15.199" style="s2">over cognitive distortions which is also</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:18.719" style="s2">a better way to argue</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.199" end="01:11:20.800" style="s2">a better way to think um a better way to</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.719" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">understand the world better is to try to</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">address these in yourselves</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">a lot of the social justice stuff the</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">most toxic of it relies</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">on on these things so they&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:32.719" style="s2">they&#39;re like matter and anti-matter</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:34.080" style="s2">and unfortunately what i see happening</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.719" end="01:11:36.640" style="s2">is rather than</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.080" end="01:11:38.159" style="s2">um go with the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.640" end="01:11:41.440" style="s2">reality-based approach</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.159" end="01:11:43.920" style="s2">um people are rejecting the obvious</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.440" end="01:11:47.360" style="s2">lessons of cbt</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting so</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.360" end="01:11:52.800" style="s2">a i find this a very provocative insight</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.800" end="01:11:55.040" style="s2">and an important one it fits exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.800" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">with what i&#39;ve encountered and so many</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.040" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">others have</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">as well but there is some</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:05.679" style="s2">incredible process by which</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">everything functional is being turned on</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.679" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">its head it&#39;s almost as if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:11.920" style="s2">that seeks that which works to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:14.480" style="s2">invalidate it</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.920" end="01:12:16.159" style="s2">so i remember you know before evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">melted down</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.159" end="01:12:20.719" style="s2">i remember the first time i was in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">faculty meeting and i</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.719" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">said something about the hazard of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:28.080" style="s2">was taking place</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">to enlightenment values</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.080" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">i didn&#39;t think the idea of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">values being a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:36.400" style="s2">could possibly be controversial in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">room full of academics</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.400" end="01:12:40.080" style="s2">but what i got back was pushback that</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">enlightenment values were</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.080" end="01:12:43.520" style="s2">this oppressive system and i was just</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:46.640" style="s2">stunned the first time i heard it</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.520" end="01:12:48.480" style="s2">but um then you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.640" end="01:12:50.719" style="s2">downstream a couple years and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.480" end="01:12:54.000" style="s2">looking at the invalidation</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.719" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">of basic arithmetic we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:58.560" style="s2">the invalidation</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:13:00.159" style="s2">of the idea of a colorblind society</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.560" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with the invalidation of</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.159" end="01:13:05.679" style="s2">the idea that there is something</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:06.480" style="s2">logical that is independent of power</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.679" end="01:13:09.120" style="s2">it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.480" end="01:13:12.159" style="s2">every single thing on which you could</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.120" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">start a reboot to some sort of agreement</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.159" end="01:13:17.360" style="s2">is being sabotaged right and</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:18.560" style="s2">you know i think you&#39;re what i find so</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.360" end="01:13:20.320" style="s2">compelling about your</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.560" end="01:13:22.480" style="s2">your point about cognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.320" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">therapy is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.480" end="01:13:29.040" style="s2">um you&#39;re talking about the basic</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">ability of the mind to cope</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.040" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">is being sabotaged by an ideology that</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">is going to make people</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.840" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">weaker more vulnerable more</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:42.880" style="s2">volatile i mean it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:43.840" style="s2">yeah no it it&#39;s and here&#39;s and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.880" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">where i actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.840" end="01:13:47.920" style="s2">because i i work at a job that can make</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:49.120" style="s2">you very angry</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.920" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the reasons why you</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.120" end="01:13:52.800" style="s2">see me compulsively cracking jokes on</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:54.480" style="s2">on twitter is because it&#39;s just like you</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.800" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">know it it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a coping mechanism but one thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:13:59.600" style="s2">that i&#39;ve tried to do since we are</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.080" end="01:14:01.280" style="s2">really trying to change the culture</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.600" end="01:14:03.199" style="s2">is when i write something i tend to take</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.280" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">out all the all the anger</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.199" end="01:14:07.199" style="s2">you know um i get rid of the adverbs you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:09.280" style="s2">know i go after everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.199" end="01:14:10.400" style="s2">um that shows anger but there is one</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.280" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">thing that i am</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.400" end="01:14:13.679" style="s2">very angry about and i didn&#39;t say in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.679" end="01:14:18.239" style="s2">is we know this generation has higher</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.480" end="01:14:19.920" style="s2">levels of anxiety and depression</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.239" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">we know this generation has higher</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.920" end="01:14:23.840" style="s2">levels of suicide now i think that some</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">of that ideology that creeps in earlies</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.840" end="01:14:27.040" style="s2">is playing a part in it</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">but also i think things like you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.040" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">the wealth stratification and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">other other factors at play</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:35.040" style="s2">but to know that and then have students</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.480" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">show up on your campus and to tell them</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.040" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">i oh yeah i know you have really high</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2">rates of suicide and depression and</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:40.880" style="s2">self-harm</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">by the way here&#39;s an ideology in which</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.880" end="01:14:45.760" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">evil um and you almost all of you</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.480" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">never actually fix it</p>

<p begin="01:15:40.320" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">do there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.679" end="01:15:44.640" style="s2">logical steps that we could actually do</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:46.080" style="s2">to take that we&#39;ve been meaning to so</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.640" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">maybe this is the chance</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.080" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">and instead that opportunity being</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.920" end="01:15:50.560" style="s2">squandered and turned into something</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">about like</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:54.719" style="s2">let&#39;s get kids kicked out of college</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:56.960" style="s2">let&#39;s get professors in trouble for</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.719" end="01:15:58.080" style="s2">faux pas essentially it&#39;s like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.960" end="01:15:59.679" style="s2">squandered this opportunity to help</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:01.920" style="s2">people in the real world</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.679" end="01:16:04.719" style="s2">um to participate in this weird</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.920" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">pointless sad little dance</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.719" end="01:16:11.520" style="s2">yes and in fact uh what we saw</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.840" end="01:16:12.400" style="s2">was that students who figured out how to</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.520" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">achieve</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:18.239" style="s2">were actually socially punished by</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:19.600" style="s2">their would-be peers for doing so</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.239" end="01:16:21.600" style="s2">there&#39;s this belief</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.600" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">you know that achievement is itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.600" end="01:16:25.679" style="s2">you&#39;re having capitulated to the system</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:28.800" style="s2">rather than you empowering yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.679" end="01:16:31.760" style="s2">um to do good in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.800" end="01:16:34.880" style="s2">you know i mean you you don&#39;t deliver</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.760" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">the punchline of the setup you just</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.880" end="01:16:39.600" style="s2">gave but basically you&#39;re arguing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:41.280" style="s2">this is going to kill people</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.600" end="01:16:43.520" style="s2">that you are taking people who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.280" end="01:16:46.800" style="s2">already vulnerable because they already</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.520" end="01:16:49.360" style="s2">have anxiety and self-doubt and you are</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.800" end="01:16:51.040" style="s2">creating an unwinnable circumstance</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.360" end="01:16:54.000" style="s2">which is exactly the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.040" end="01:16:55.600" style="s2">um hopeless situation that does lead</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.000" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">people to hurt themselves</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.600" end="01:16:59.520" style="s2">and i i agree with you you know i as a</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">professor i very</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.520" end="01:17:06.320" style="s2">keenly felt an obligation to see</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:09.360" style="s2">students and to help them see</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.320" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">clearly in part because things do look</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.360" end="01:17:14.159" style="s2">pretty hopeless until somebody helps you</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:16.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know navigate the world and</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.159" end="01:17:17.600" style="s2">understand where you where you fit in it</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.000" end="01:17:19.600" style="s2">and just to see a movement</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.600" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">undoing that kind of work in some sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.600" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">of generic blanket across the board</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:28.480" style="s2">super rapid way is very frightening yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">yeah and ultimately relying on tactics</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.480" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">to win arguments in dorms in the 1990s</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:34.719" style="s2">yeah now once you say it you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:37.120" style="s2">right about that</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.719" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">all right last question where do you</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.120" end="01:17:40.320" style="s2">think we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:41.679" style="s2">i hope i was always i always hope the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.320" end="01:17:44.719" style="s2">last question will be uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.679" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">how dare you</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.719" end="01:17:48.560" style="s2">where do i think we&#39;re headed um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:51.120" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:51.600" style="s2">a lot less confident in that prediction</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.120" end="01:17:53.679" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:54.719" style="s2">that i than i would have been maybe five</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.679" end="01:17:55.920" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.719" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">things are going to get worse before</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.920" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">they get better um for sure</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:02.320" style="s2">i am so optimistic about the upcoming</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.760" end="01:18:04.000" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.320" end="01:18:06.719" style="s2">that my family and i are getting out of</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.000" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">dc uh for the entire month of november</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.719" end="01:18:12.719" style="s2">um and i love my i love this town like i</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:13.600" style="s2">i i like dc as a city in its own right</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.719" end="01:18:15.520" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.600" end="01:18:17.280" style="s2">i&#39;m scared about what november is going</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.520" end="01:18:17.920" style="s2">to look like and and people like what</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.280" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.920" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">i&#39;m like when you can think of 14</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.080" end="01:18:22.800" style="s2">different possible</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:24.239" style="s2">possible scenarios it might be time to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.800" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">take your kids and</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.239" end="01:18:27.440" style="s2">and go in the short term i think things</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.440" end="01:18:30.560" style="s2">in the next i&#39;m not looking forward to</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">the next six months</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.560" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">um if there is a landslide that would</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:37.040" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.679" end="01:18:38.640" style="s2">um because what certainty one way or</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.040" end="01:18:41.040" style="s2">another would help but the idea that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.640" end="01:18:43.280" style="s2">actually have you know someone saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.040" end="01:18:44.960" style="s2">a president saying that the the election</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.280" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">is flawed there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.960" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be radicalizing like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:49.600" style="s2">the old mcvey types you know from the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">1990s</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.600" end="01:18:54.080" style="s2">who blew up stuff to um so that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:55.600" style="s2">to be incredibly ugly so basically yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.080" end="01:18:57.040" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m predicting things are going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.040" end="01:19:00.640" style="s2">very ugly for the next six months i</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.960" end="01:19:01.440" style="s2">don&#39;t really know what things are going</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">to look like</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.440" end="01:19:07.120" style="s2">after um after covid uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:08.880" style="s2">the you know i&#39;m super i&#39;m hopeful that</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.120" end="01:19:10.640" style="s2">20 20 21</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.880" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">will be a better year i think it almost</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.640" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">statistically has to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">a better year um but you know when it</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:18.320" style="s2">comes to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:20.840" style="s2">the the long scheme the long scheme of</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.320" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">thing i&#39;m i&#39;m bullish on the human race</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.840" end="01:19:25.360" style="s2">um i think as long as we don&#39;t kill the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:28.159" style="s2">golden goose of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.360" end="01:19:29.840" style="s2">not just of of of um producing wealth</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.159" end="01:19:30.640" style="s2">and growth which we desperately need to</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.840" end="01:19:32.239" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.640" end="01:19:34.400" style="s2">which is much more essential to our</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.239" end="01:19:37.360" style="s2">society that than people seem to get</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.400" end="01:19:38.159" style="s2">um you know particularly in some in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.360" end="01:19:40.159" style="s2">of these circles</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.159" end="01:19:41.280" style="s2">i&#39;m also very excited about you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.159" end="01:19:43.280" style="s2">technological</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.280" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">progress and i do think the long-term</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:48.960" style="s2">is better than you would think given all</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.199" end="01:19:49.360" style="s2">the all the things conspiring against it</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.960" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.360" end="01:19:53.520" style="s2">one very simple reason that you alluded</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.440" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">to before it works really well</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.520" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">um societies that actually can talk</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:20:00.080" style="s2">tend to do better but uh for the next</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:03.440" style="s2">six months</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.080" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">um if i could get i i cropped i cracked</p>

<p begin="01:20:06.080" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">about how uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.760" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">time travel is possible and we know that</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">if you can you know get</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:14.239" style="s2">any fragment of the speed of light you</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">start actually having noticeable time</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.239" end="01:20:16.400" style="s2">shifts and</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:18.000" style="s2">therefore i&#39;d like the country to take</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.400" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2">the sacrifice and move me and my</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.000" end="01:20:23.040" style="s2">family into i don&#39;t know like may of</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.920" end="01:20:26.080" style="s2">next year next year as fast as possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.040" end="01:20:27.600" style="s2">i like it oh yeah i i agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.080" end="01:20:30.000" style="s2">it seems like there&#39;s an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.600" end="01:20:33.199" style="s2">potential energy built up in the system</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.000" end="01:20:34.320" style="s2">yeah i did i read david french&#39;s um book</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.199" end="01:20:37.040" style="s2">divided we fall</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.320" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">um and i also have to remind my fellow</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.040" end="01:20:39.920" style="s2">left of center people it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:41.840" style="s2">this is one of the few people who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.920" end="01:20:43.920" style="s2">right up center who&#39;s actually trying so</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:46.719" style="s2">don&#39;t kick him away but he made such a</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.920" end="01:20:50.000" style="s2">plausible case for um</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.719" end="01:20:51.280" style="s2">uh for the country dividing and</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.000" end="01:20:53.040" style="s2">one thing that he did that i think was</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.280" end="01:20:55.360" style="s2">really important that people tend to</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.040" end="01:20:57.360" style="s2">you know forget is what the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:20:58.480" style="s2">for world peace would be if suddenly the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.360" end="01:21:01.040" style="s2">us were</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.480" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">divided and and the number number one</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.040" end="01:21:04.480" style="s2">and two powers</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.840" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">in the world where china and russia yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.480" end="01:21:08.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.960" end="01:21:08.719" style="s2">so can i ask you um i i have looked at</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">the map</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.719" end="01:21:13.840" style="s2">and unfortunately the cities are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:15.679" style="s2">distributed about the place in such a</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.840" end="01:21:18.719" style="s2">way that they can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.679" end="01:21:20.000" style="s2">secede from the rural parts of the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.719" end="01:21:22.000" style="s2">have you ever noticed this</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.000" end="01:21:23.840" style="s2">oh yeah i talk about population density</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.000" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">and how much of how much of a predictor</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.840" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.239" end="01:21:28.000" style="s2">of uh of where you are politically and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">and you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">um i do think that probably the most</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:34.560" style="s2">plausible one</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:35.760" style="s2">would be some kind of like california</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.560" end="01:21:37.520" style="s2">secession</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.760" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">was the one that i think would that</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.520" end="01:21:42.400" style="s2">seems the most plausible to me</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:43.280" style="s2">california well geez okay yeah i mean we</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.400" end="01:21:45.360" style="s2">talk sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.280" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">uh i think mostly jokingly about</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.360" end="01:21:49.440" style="s2">cascadia</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:52.719" style="s2">up here but um yeah i i</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.440" end="01:21:54.080" style="s2">must say i&#39;m stuck uh with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.719" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">recognition that there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.080" end="01:21:57.520" style="s2">geographic</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">mechanism to divide the country that</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.520" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">solves the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:03.440" style="s2">the puzzle as it stands well that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:06.000" style="s2">of the reasons why i like um</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.440" end="01:22:07.120" style="s2">i like david french&#39;s closest thing to a</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.000" end="01:22:11.040" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.120" end="01:22:12.639" style="s2">which is let&#39;s get comfortable with um</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.040" end="01:22:13.840" style="s2">federalism again you know essentially</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.639" end="01:22:15.520" style="s2">like if the states are going to be this</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.840" end="01:22:17.040" style="s2">different let them be that different</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.520" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">you know within the bill of rights of</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.040" end="01:22:19.600" style="s2">course um because you know they should</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:21.199" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.600" end="01:22:23.120" style="s2">obliged by that but you know if</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:24.719" style="s2">countries if states want to experiment</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.120" end="01:22:25.520" style="s2">with everything from health care to as</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.719" end="01:22:27.840" style="s2">they already are</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.520" end="01:22:28.560" style="s2">you know uh medical marijuana and that</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.840" end="01:22:31.520" style="s2">kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.560" end="01:22:31.840" style="s2">then we should definitely remember that</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.520" end="01:22:33.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.840" end="01:22:34.960" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve been pretty desperate</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.679" end="01:22:37.199" style="s2">before and</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.960" end="01:22:38.800" style="s2">as long as you as long as you allow for</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.199" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">something that allows a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.800" end="01:22:43.520" style="s2">internal diversity we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.040" end="01:22:45.760" style="s2">potentially weather it but if we</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:48.320" style="s2">if we try too hard to to have impose</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.760" end="01:22:51.440" style="s2">uniformity we&#39;re going to snap</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.320" end="01:22:52.239" style="s2">um do you think we could give the woke</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.440" end="01:22:54.800" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.239" end="01:22:56.400" style="s2">a state or loan it to them and then when</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.800" end="01:22:56.960" style="s2">they discover how dangerous what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.400" end="01:22:58.880" style="s2">playing with</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.960" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">is maybe we could be generous and</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.880" end="01:23:03.360" style="s2">welcome them back and uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:04.719" style="s2">start over i wouldn&#39;t wish that upon my</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.360" end="01:23:07.360" style="s2">uh darkest enemy</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.719" end="01:23:08.560" style="s2">i hear you yeah now that i hear myself</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.360" end="01:23:11.600" style="s2">say it&#39;s a terrible idea</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.560" end="01:23:12.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a i mean my my here&#39;s my family</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.600" end="01:23:13.840" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.080" end="01:23:15.840" style="s2">my great-grandfather was a serf he</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.840" end="01:23:16.480" style="s2">bought his way into freedom in 1858 and</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.840" end="01:23:18.480" style="s2">immediately</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.480" end="01:23:20.400" style="s2">lucianov started doing very well we</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.480" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">became professors and lawyers and judges</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.400" end="01:23:22.480" style="s2">and landowners and all this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:24.480" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.480" end="01:23:26.159" style="s2">we were peasants who made good and in</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.480" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2">every any other country that would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.159" end="01:23:29.040" style="s2">considered commendable</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.280" end="01:23:30.880" style="s2">and instead there was an ideology that</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.040" end="01:23:33.199" style="s2">my family had been fighting</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.880" end="01:23:34.000" style="s2">you know ever since we could read</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.199" end="01:23:35.600" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.000" end="01:23:37.440" style="s2">that was over simplistic and that was</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.600" end="01:23:39.440" style="s2">usually by</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.440" end="01:23:40.880" style="s2">intellectuals first generation educated</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.440" end="01:23:43.040" style="s2">people and meanwhile the peasants were</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.880" end="01:23:45.280" style="s2">like actually i&#39;d like things to be 15</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.040" end="01:23:46.639" style="s2">better you know it&#39;d be lovely if i</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.280" end="01:23:48.239" style="s2">could own a couple more things and have</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.639" end="01:23:50.560" style="s2">some more time off but the</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.239" end="01:23:53.840" style="s2">but the intellectuals wanted the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.560" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">revolution so for example in 1862</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.840" end="01:23:57.280" style="s2">um was 62 they assassinated zara</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">alexander ii</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:01.120" style="s2">on his way to create a duma on his way</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:03.120" style="s2">to create a parliament</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.120" end="01:24:04.239" style="s2">because these radicals thought that that</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.120" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna that would</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.239" end="01:24:07.440" style="s2">that would be too good and people</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want their glorious</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.440" end="01:24:10.560" style="s2">you know bolshevik revolution at that</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">point so and so like the progress of</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.560" end="01:24:15.120" style="s2">russia was stalled by people who</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:16.639" style="s2">by by this category of people and they</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.120" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">wanted to shoot people like me and my</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.639" end="01:24:20.080" style="s2">family in the back of the head because</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:21.040" style="s2">we were educated but didn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.080" end="01:24:23.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the reasons why we had</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.040" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">to get the hell out of there and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.440" end="01:24:26.960" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">what these ideologies can do once they</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.960" end="01:24:32.639" style="s2">take on that religious fervor</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">and having to fight it again</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.639" end="01:24:38.560" style="s2">terrifies me um but uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:40.000" style="s2">hopefully you know people will not let</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.560" end="01:24:41.840" style="s2">that happen again</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.000" end="01:24:43.040" style="s2">hopefully well i have to say i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.840" end="01:24:44.960" style="s2">help but hear an</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.040" end="01:24:46.719" style="s2">echo of evergreen and so many other</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.960" end="01:24:47.679" style="s2">places in what you just described you</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.719" end="01:24:49.760" style="s2">know the idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.679" end="01:24:51.600" style="s2">of uh you becoming a villain because</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.760" end="01:24:53.679" style="s2">you&#39;re educated and you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.600" end="01:24:55.360" style="s2">yeah that feels like exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.679" end="01:24:59.440" style="s2">happened um</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.360" end="01:25:00.320" style="s2">i will say greg i&#39;m not all that hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.440" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">about where</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.320" end="01:25:03.679" style="s2">we&#39;re headed i agree with you about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">danger of what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.679" end="01:25:08.719" style="s2">but i&#39;m uh really pleased to have you on</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:10.800" style="s2">the right side</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.719" end="01:25:12.000" style="s2">absolutely brett and i&#39;m looking forward</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.800" end="01:25:14.159" style="s2">to seeing you again</p>
