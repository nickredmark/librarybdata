<p begin="00:00:05.330" end="00:00:10.050" style="s2">this is a quick update about a big event</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">we&#39;ve got coming up next Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.050" end="00:00:14.099" style="s2">and also a quick update as to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:16.920" style="s2">doing and how we&#39;re trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.099" end="00:00:19.590" style="s2">ramp up rebel wisdom to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:21.990" style="s2">what&#39;s going on because our sense is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">that this is a beginning of as Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:27.090" style="s2">Hall talks about the meta-crisis a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:29.010" style="s2">of these sort of systemic issues that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.090" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about on the channel around</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.010" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">existential risk and phase-shift are now</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">really kind of coming home to roost like</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:38.040" style="s2">this is where we feel that we&#39;re at we</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:41.219" style="s2">feel that this is going to be just the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.040" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">first stage in a growing crisis that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.219" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">going to be who knows how long it will</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">last but it but it will be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">sort of shift into a new operating</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">system as the old operating system shows</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s not really fit for purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try and kind of outline</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">that in the films we&#39;re gonna be putting</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">out over the next week&#39;s but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">thinking because we&#39;ve always been about</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">not just the intellectual content but</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">also about kind of the the inner shifts</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">that we need to kind of make to be equal</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">to the challenge of the times that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">what we&#39;re really thinking about with</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">this big online event which Ali&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">to talk about now yeah so the event is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">free online event it&#39;s gonna be on</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">Sunday April the fifth and it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:29.820" style="s2">combination of the two things we have in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">the title resilience and sense making so</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.820" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">the part of the way it came about is we</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">were we were talking about what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">really needed right now what are we all</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">in need of and those qualities feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">really essential in a time when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">a huge amount of change a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">complexity so resilience is our ability</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">to withstand pressure and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">becoming more and more important and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">since making it is obviously our ability</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">to understand what&#39;s going on and those</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">two concepts and those two qualities</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">that we can develop are very tightly</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">coupled together because if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:02.250" style="s2">make sense of the world and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on we don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.250" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">way to turn you don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">direction to go in that has a huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">impact our resilience kind of wears it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">down so we need to be connecting both of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">those things together so in this film</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">we&#39;ll kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">introduce you to who&#39;s gonna be at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">event and they kind of split in two</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">let&#39;s call them sense makers so people</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">like Jamie wheel and Dinah Shore</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">Hamilton who will talk about the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">and then a whole host of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">facilitators who we&#39;ve we know where</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve worked with in the past to who can</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:34.470" style="s2">really give tools that that increase</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">either our resilience or our sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:38.130" style="s2">making so here we&#39;re just gonna play a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:39.810" style="s2">few short clips from some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.130" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2">speakers and facilitators who are going</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.810" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">to be taking part in the event starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">with Jamie wheel things are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:51.150" style="s2">destabilize before they Rico here I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">think I opened our talk on Thursday</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.150" end="00:02:54.989" style="s2">night with this same quote from</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller because it&#39;s it gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.989" end="00:02:59.130" style="s2">us to the point where he says quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:01.950" style="s2">clearly our task is predominantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.130" end="00:03:04.980" style="s2">metaphysical but is how to get all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.950" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">humanity to educate itself swiftly</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.980" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">enough to generate spontaneous social</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">behaviors that will avoid extinction now</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">he read that half a century ago sure he</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">was on time there were many many things</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:22.769" style="s2">he was well ahead of the curve on so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">also have Diane musho Hamilton who we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:27.209" style="s2">had on the channel before and Diane is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">really an expert facilitator she&#39;s a Zen</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.209" end="00:03:32.130" style="s2">master and has a lot of experience in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:34.140" style="s2">mediation as well so Diane is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.130" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">helping us to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.140" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">emotional landscape we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">right now so I find that the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">together are extremely helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:44.700" style="s2">during our time right now where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:46.920" style="s2">experiencing more global stress we talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">about existential threats and wicked</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.920" end="00:03:51.690" style="s2">problems right now we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">this challenge of this virus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.690" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">affecting all public health around the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">world it&#39;s really important that we but</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">we have both skill sets so then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">got a combination of sort of individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">practices for resilience and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:08.489" style="s2">community resilience how do we build</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">more anti fragile community for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.489" end="00:04:13.829" style="s2">ourselves where we live and also online</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">so we have Sarah ness and rich Bartlett</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.829" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">who we both featured recently in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">film about resilience I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">really important what they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">share are things really really important</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:25.950" style="s2">and we&#39;re also going to create a space</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">for people to offer help and also ask</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.950" end="00:04:28.470" style="s2">for help and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">try and create more of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.470" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">community feeling of everyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">attending the event so as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">talks and the framing then we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">of different practices and the practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">are really important we&#39;ve said on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:42.090" style="s2">channel quite a few times that we you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:43.229" style="s2">know we need an intellectual framing we</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.090" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">need to be able to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.229" end="00:04:47.400" style="s2">but then we need to really live these</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:49.229" style="s2">insights out in our own lives and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:52.169" style="s2">where we see the real impact is when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.229" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">combine those two things and so and as</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.169" end="00:04:56.430" style="s2">well as that we we&#39;re really conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:58.889" style="s2">of having I think John for baekje often</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.430" end="00:05:00.830" style="s2">calls an ecology of practices so lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.889" end="00:05:02.879" style="s2">different techniques and practices</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.830" end="00:05:04.620" style="s2">trained different skills and different</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.879" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">types of awareness in us and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:11.009" style="s2">trying to get as broad a range as we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:14.190" style="s2">so for example we have breath work and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.009" end="00:05:16.409" style="s2">breath work is really really really very</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.190" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">effective at helping us to gain insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.409" end="00:05:20.969" style="s2">but also to regulate our nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:23.219" style="s2">it&#39;s a control of our nervous system and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.969" end="00:05:25.259" style="s2">build our resilience consciously so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.219" end="00:05:26.969" style="s2">have amazing breath work facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.259" end="00:05:29.940" style="s2">called Nicola price who&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.969" end="00:05:32.599" style="s2">leading some breath work sessions and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.940" end="00:05:34.650" style="s2">also have various different types of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.599" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">movement or what we sometimes call</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">embodiments are really coming into an</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:40.590" style="s2">awareness of our bodies and really</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:43.259" style="s2">connecting to that so we have coral for</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.590" end="00:05:45.930" style="s2">who&#39;s a brilliant yoga master we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.259" end="00:05:48.150" style="s2">worked with before as well and we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.930" end="00:05:50.699" style="s2">Chris crude le who is a martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.150" end="00:05:52.469" style="s2">expert and so a TV presenter so he&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.699" end="00:05:54.300" style="s2">giving some simple techniques people can</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.469" end="00:05:57.000" style="s2">use as well and we also have a variety</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.300" end="00:05:59.279" style="s2">of other practices from from mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.000" end="00:06:00.719" style="s2">and relating practices as well so</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.279" end="00:06:02.909" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a lot on offer and people</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.719" end="00:06:04.500" style="s2">can kind of in those sessions pick and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.909" end="00:06:06.539" style="s2">choose whatever it feels like you need</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.500" end="00:06:08.669" style="s2">the most right now there should</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.539" end="00:06:10.500" style="s2">hopefully be something for you so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.669" end="00:06:13.110" style="s2">on that note as well about relational</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.500" end="00:06:14.610" style="s2">practices we&#39;re also releasing a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.110" end="00:06:17.449" style="s2">of films that we made for our online</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.610" end="00:06:20.340" style="s2">course one about inquiry and one</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.449" end="00:06:22.650" style="s2">meditation that we recorded around in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.340" end="00:06:24.870" style="s2">sovereignty and the inquiry one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.650" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">basically a guide to how to do inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.870" end="00:06:28.340" style="s2">is something we&#39;ve talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">past on the channel we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.340" end="00:06:34.469" style="s2">circling and different forms of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:36.180" style="s2">of pursuing the truth of the moment like</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.469" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a really really important practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.180" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">and the inquiry film talks about how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:43.810" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:45.610" style="s2">a practice of inquiry and why I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.810" end="00:06:47.590" style="s2">that&#39;s really important that it&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.610" end="00:06:50.320" style="s2">through in a lot more detail but what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.590" end="00:06:52.390" style="s2">really amounts to is a relational</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.320" end="00:06:54.760" style="s2">practice it&#39;s like a talking meditation</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.390" end="00:06:57.220" style="s2">of really trying to kind of come to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.760" end="00:06:59.290" style="s2">truth of what wants to emerge in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.220" end="00:07:02.190" style="s2">moment and why I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.290" end="00:07:05.110" style="s2">really important especially right now is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.190" end="00:07:07.300" style="s2">that as we start to develop that as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.110" end="00:07:09.370" style="s2">practice we start becoming much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.300" end="00:07:12.130" style="s2">aware of that in ourselves much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.370" end="00:07:15.760" style="s2">self-aware and then we also start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.130" end="00:07:19.960" style="s2">notice in the outside world what is new</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.760" end="00:07:21.820" style="s2">and exciting and what is emergent in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.960" end="00:07:24.520" style="s2">the culture we start to attune ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.820" end="00:07:26.140" style="s2">to what wants what is much more emergent</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.520" end="00:07:27.550" style="s2">in the culture and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.140" end="00:07:30.310" style="s2">important right now because I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:33.100" style="s2">we&#39;re very clear that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.310" end="00:07:35.320" style="s2">pre-existing fixed answers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.100" end="00:07:37.000" style="s2">ideologies are not going to be enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.320" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">for the task we&#39;re going to have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.000" end="00:07:40.120" style="s2">of go into the liminal we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:42.130" style="s2">liminal right now I&#39;m going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.120" end="00:07:44.229" style="s2">go deeper into it to come out the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.130" end="00:07:46.900" style="s2">side so that&#39;s what these practices</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.229" end="00:07:49.300" style="s2">allow us to do yeah that&#39;s a really nice</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.900" end="00:07:51.130" style="s2">point about the liminal because part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.300" end="00:07:53.229" style="s2">that that kind of in-between space that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.130" end="00:07:55.150" style="s2">we&#39;re in as a culture and I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.229" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">of us feel we&#39;re in in our lives right</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.150" end="00:08:00.490" style="s2">now because of the environment you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">one of the skills that really helps in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.490" end="00:08:06.280" style="s2">that moment is the ability to be present</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.350" style="s2">and the ability to be with whatever&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.280" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">going on and to kind of flow with it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s very much what part of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:14.050" style="s2">inquiry can give is that we&#39;re on a kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">of flowing process of following</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.050" end="00:08:17.950" style="s2">different threads as they emerge rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:20.950" style="s2">than trying to place a frame onto</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.950" end="00:08:23.410" style="s2">something and so the other thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.950" end="00:08:24.729" style="s2">releasing that we&#39;ve had from that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.410" end="00:08:27.190" style="s2">developed rather for the online course</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.729" end="00:08:29.200" style="s2">is what we call the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.190" end="00:08:30.580" style="s2">meditation and the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.200" end="00:08:32.289" style="s2">meditation combines a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.580" end="00:08:34.409" style="s2">practices we&#39;ve mentioned already so it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.289" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">combines breadth and then goes into</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.409" end="00:08:39.330" style="s2">concentration source or meditation so</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:41.650" style="s2">really zooming in and then goes into</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.330" end="00:08:44.290" style="s2">contemplation and mindfulness zooming</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.650" end="00:08:47.160" style="s2">out and then into inquiry either</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.290" end="00:08:49.959" style="s2">journaling or inquiring with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.160" end="00:08:52.780" style="s2">actually in a way the structure of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.959" end="00:08:53.710" style="s2">meditation kind of says something as</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.780" end="00:08:55.270" style="s2">well about</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.710" end="00:08:57.070" style="s2">partly what&#39;s needed and partly why</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.270" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this this day is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:03.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a combination in that of zooming</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:05.560" style="s2">in and zooming out so Joan rebecky says</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.310" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">really you know talks really well about</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.560" end="00:09:10.210" style="s2">the fact that some practices help us</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:12.070" style="s2">really zoom in and get more insight into</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.210" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">ourselves but we also need to combine</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.070" end="00:09:14.500" style="s2">that with zooming out</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:16.630" style="s2">so that kind of seeing the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.500" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">picture was when we zoom out we can see</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.630" end="00:09:21.520" style="s2">where our frames are broken and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:23.410" style="s2">these practices are about very much like</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.520" end="00:09:25.390" style="s2">removing your glasses saying okay where</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.410" end="00:09:27.160" style="s2">where have we been seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.390" end="00:09:29.590" style="s2">incorrectly where have we been deceiving</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.160" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">ourselves in some way and that&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.590" end="00:09:33.670" style="s2">way what we&#39;re doing as an entire</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:35.830" style="s2">culture right now you know business as</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.670" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">usual is is gone and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.830" end="00:09:40.450" style="s2">probably never coming back</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:42.220" style="s2">and so we&#39;re left now with to some</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.450" end="00:09:44.230" style="s2">degree other fixing or creating new</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.220" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">frames like new ways of seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.230" end="00:09:49.780" style="s2">new ways of interacting and it&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.100" end="00:09:52.570" style="s2">that we have some kind of process of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.780" end="00:09:54.130" style="s2">thinking deeply about this and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.570" end="00:09:56.380" style="s2">talking about it but then these</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.130" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">practices keep it fresh and they keep us</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.380" end="00:10:01.330" style="s2">from falling into different cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:03.220" style="s2">traps that we all have capacity to fall</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.330" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">into so in in a sense it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.220" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">development of wisdom individually and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:11.710" style="s2">as a group yeah and the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:13.390" style="s2">we are starting to really ramp up is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.710" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2">community calls we were doing there</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.390" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">every month and we&#39;re now going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:20.530" style="s2">doing them every week and with a guest</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:23.410" style="s2">so the next one next fuse day will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.530" end="00:10:26.170" style="s2">with Jordan Hall so a group sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.410" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">call with Jordan Hall which you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.170" end="00:10:30.820" style="s2">mentioned at the beginning Allie but</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:32.650" style="s2">it&#39;s for me sense making is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.820" end="00:10:34.960" style="s2">absolutely essential part of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.650" end="00:10:36.940" style="s2">because if we can really understand and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.960" end="00:10:38.980" style="s2">Jordan Hall is one of the best of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.940" end="00:10:41.110" style="s2">kind of just explaining what the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.980" end="00:10:42.970" style="s2">shifts are that we&#39;re seeing and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.110" end="00:10:45.270" style="s2">decay of kind of our own systems what</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.970" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">wants to come through if we can really</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.270" end="00:10:49.870" style="s2">understand that then we&#39;re not gonna we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:51.430" style="s2">are going to be more resilient cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.870" end="00:10:53.950" style="s2">not gonna be surprised by what happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.430" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna basically I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.950" end="00:10:57.450" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been watching us walked in</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:10:59.590" style="s2">the channel for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.450" end="00:11:01.270" style="s2">certainly from the sense-making calls</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.590" end="00:11:04.090" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had so far most of them have</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.270" end="00:11:06.290" style="s2">said we were expecting this we we feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.090" end="00:11:08.329" style="s2">like we knew this was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.290" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">and we feel actually quite excited about</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.329" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2">what the shift is that we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:13.579" style="s2">verge on so if you can really understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.750" end="00:11:16.040" style="s2">what these deeper shifts are we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.579" end="00:11:18.440" style="s2">prepare and we can not be knocked off</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">our sense of when they happen yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">just to just a round off if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:25.880" style="s2">interested in taking part in the day</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:28.519" style="s2">then do register there&#39;ll be a link in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.880" end="00:11:31.550" style="s2">the show notes below and we&#39;ll see you</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.519" end="00:11:34.009" style="s2">soon as the tech revolution continues to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.550" end="00:11:36.250" style="s2">destroy old media the Internet is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.009" end="00:11:39.110" style="s2">fueling a new intellectual awakening</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.250" end="00:11:41.029" style="s2">television made people look stupider</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.110" end="00:11:44.540" style="s2">than they were it turns out that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.029" end="00:11:47.509" style="s2">are smarter with longer attention spans</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.540" end="00:11:49.610" style="s2">then we thought I&#39;m a journalist and</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.959" end="00:11:58.190" style="s2">mainstream media can provide the level</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.759" end="00:11:59.930" style="s2">of analysis and insight we need for the</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.329" end="00:12:07.339" style="s2">of the world break down it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.180" end="00:12:18.529" style="s2">and when our ways of thinking break down</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the rebels and the renegades who</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.110" style="s2">to reboot the system all right so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.760" end="00:12:25.459" style="s2">happening is that people are perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.110" end="00:12:28.490" style="s2">because it&#39;s becoming increasingly</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.610" end="00:12:38.630" style="s2">to pretend isn&#39;t happening and so as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.290" end="00:12:40.040" style="s2">consequence this triggers a deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.630" end="00:12:41.959" style="s2">visceral sense and that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.040" end="00:12:44.180" style="s2">right because that deep visceral sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.959" end="00:12:47.060" style="s2">is the return to the aluminum the return</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.180" end="00:12:51.560" style="s2">to the mystery the shift that we are on</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.810" end="00:12:57.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like more like a shift from single</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.950" end="00:13:02.899" style="s2">these are the people and ideas rebel</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.570" end="00:13:12.529" style="s2">recognize that we don&#39;t have to value</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.940" end="00:13:14.630" style="s2">the game that it is playing and that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.529" end="00:13:15.709" style="s2">can now repurpose the hardware to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.630" end="00:13:17.899" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.709" end="00:13:20.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what I actually have hope in is</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.899" end="00:13:22.910" style="s2">that if if enough people can come to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.600" end="00:13:24.680" style="s2">that realization then then we wake up</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.910" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">and not in some</p>
