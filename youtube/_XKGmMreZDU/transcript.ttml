<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:37.670" style="s2">like higher trust higher bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.070" end="00:01:42.950" style="s2">conversations that aren&#39;t based in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.670" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">teacher Lee authority or epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.950" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">authority I think is something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">definitely trying to curate on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">podcast just in general and in my life</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">so I super respect your resistance there</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">and I want to respect that and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">definitely want this to be as totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">conversational and you know where this</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:10.770" style="s2">can be totally whatever we want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:11.800" style="s2">and I eyes what&#39;s coming what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.770" end="00:02:14.770" style="s2">up right there</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.800" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been talking about this I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.770" end="00:02:23.050" style="s2">at the stoah and then with my daily</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:26.230" style="s2">journals is that this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.050" end="00:02:28.060" style="s2">tomorrow it&#39;s like you know tomorrow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">like a concept alright and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.060" end="00:02:32.850" style="s2">actually feel that concept I felt since</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:38.020" style="s2">of that concept that has died for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.850" end="00:02:39.910" style="s2">tomorrow has died for me well and when</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.020" end="00:02:41.470" style="s2">if there&#39;s no tomorrow then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.910" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">logic dictates there&#39;s no today or no</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:45.940" style="s2">yesterday and if you&#39;re kind of living</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:48.010" style="s2">like there&#39;s no tomorrow and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.940" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">actually got this this idea was put on</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.010" end="00:02:54.190" style="s2">my radar or someone on Facebook saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:55.600" style="s2">about their procrastination like means</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.190" end="00:02:56.740" style="s2">putting things off er tomorrow but if</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.600" end="00:02:58.510" style="s2">there&#39;s the concept that s&#39;more doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.740" end="00:03:00.910" style="s2">exist then it stirred like an anti</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.510" end="00:03:03.610" style="s2">crafts nation occurs and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.910" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">interesting and that came up because if</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.610" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">you live like there there&#39;s a tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">then you have all these hopes and fears</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:12.610" style="s2">about your projects like what this podge</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:14.920" style="s2">of this podcast or things you write or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.610" end="00:03:17.290" style="s2">whatever and then there&#39;s like subtle</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.920" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">like egoic machinations like I want it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.290" end="00:03:20.980" style="s2">to be a certain way so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:23.320" style="s2">instrumentalize your word in order to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.980" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">meet that but if you have no tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.320" end="00:03:31.300" style="s2">you&#39;re just talking in the now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:31.959" style="s2">good place to be that&#39;s a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.300" end="00:03:35.320" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.959" end="00:03:38.320" style="s2">it feels cool that&#39;s a good place to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.320" end="00:03:43.209" style="s2">and I just even as we just begin to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.320" end="00:03:46.660" style="s2">I can hear the like the under lying like</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.209" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">the girders of Stoicism in just like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.660" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">your views there right yeah yeah so tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:58.630" style="s2">me about stoicism in general like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.930" end="00:04:01.750" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily think that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.630" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">be the end-all be-all voice for what</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.750" end="00:04:06.070" style="s2">this kind of sect of philosophy is but</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:08.739" style="s2">tell me how you like came across it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.070" end="00:04:11.019" style="s2">what it you know what&#39;s your history</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.739" end="00:04:14.350" style="s2">what what drew you to it and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.019" end="00:04:16.660" style="s2">done for you yeah so I hate talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.350" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.660" end="00:04:23.170" style="s2">hate is too strong a word but I dislike</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:27.920" style="s2">it why is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.170" end="00:04:31.970" style="s2">Epictetus said that don&#39;t explain your</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.920" end="00:04:34.640" style="s2">philosophy and body it and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.970" end="00:04:37.670" style="s2">started this stoicism Toronto group here</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.640" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">about three years ago and it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.670" end="00:04:42.290" style="s2">became like the largest oak group in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:45.650" style="s2">world had a big presence a lot of eyes</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.290" end="00:04:48.710" style="s2">were on us and I was sort of bored bored</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.650" end="00:04:50.900" style="s2">with it to be honest I didn&#39;t enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.710" end="00:04:54.890" style="s2">because the kind of wider stoic</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.900" end="00:04:56.690" style="s2">community they they just sort of talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.890" end="00:04:58.490" style="s2">about stoicism you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.690" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">there&#39;s like there&#39;s only so much you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.490" end="00:05:01.580" style="s2">can talk about and I will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:03.980" style="s2">I&#39;ll kind of explained it about life for</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.580" end="00:05:05.210" style="s2">you for people who were just on being on</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.980" end="00:05:06.830" style="s2">board into the whole philosophy but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.210" end="00:05:10.850" style="s2">feel like this preface is important for</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.830" end="00:05:12.140" style="s2">me and yes I got really bored so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.850" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">started this other group called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.140" end="00:05:18.290" style="s2">intellectual Explorers Club which</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:21.070" style="s2">afforded me to speak more on sort of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.290" end="00:05:23.000" style="s2">more jazzy intellectual interests I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.070" end="00:05:25.190" style="s2">called it like being a performative</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.000" end="00:05:27.590" style="s2">agnostic method act someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.190" end="00:05:28.940" style="s2">reality tunnel as if it were true so not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.590" end="00:05:30.590" style="s2">only you can think what they think but</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.940" end="00:05:33.740" style="s2">you feel what they think or feel what</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.590" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">they feel I should say that was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.740" end="00:05:37.790" style="s2">fun and that kind of gave me a presence</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:40.760" style="s2">on the internet with some of my musings</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.790" end="00:05:42.440" style="s2">on the culture war and whatnot but when</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.760" end="00:05:43.880" style="s2">this whole Kovac thing happened I said</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.440" end="00:05:45.500" style="s2">you know what let&#39;s combine those two</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.880" end="00:05:47.720" style="s2">things my stoicism really came online</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.500" end="00:05:49.820" style="s2">doing and this is kind of a search</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.720" end="00:05:51.290" style="s2">uncertain liminal state so I said you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.820" end="00:05:55.850" style="s2">know let&#39;s combine those things and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.290" end="00:05:57.830" style="s2">start the stoah and the stoah stoah poke</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.850" end="00:06:00.200" style="s2">alley is where this original Stoics was</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.830" end="00:06:02.090" style="s2">Xena gathered around and talked and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.200" end="00:06:03.140" style="s2">people said hey look through the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.090" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">and they got that&#39;s how they got their</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.140" end="00:06:07.870" style="s2">name and I&#39;m viewing the stoah as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:10.760" style="s2">place that&#39;s steward it by a stoic me</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.870" end="00:06:12.890" style="s2">but not necessarily to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.760" end="00:06:15.260" style="s2">stoicism a practice solecism which will</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.890" end="00:06:16.940" style="s2">happen there but a place to go here and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.260" end="00:06:20.300" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.940" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">nice edge of this moment so given all</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.300" end="00:06:24.740" style="s2">that uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:26.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll give sort of if you&#39;d like and give</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.740" end="00:06:29.980" style="s2">you like a 101 version of how I hold</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.630" end="00:06:33.550" style="s2">stoicism would love that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.980" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">so kind of the essence of stoicism is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.550" end="00:06:39.290" style="s2">live in accordance with nature another</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:40.550" style="s2">way I like to frame it but I got this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.290" end="00:06:42.830" style="s2">from Jordan Hall even though he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.550" end="00:06:45.950" style="s2">stoic is being in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.830" end="00:06:48.890" style="s2">with reality and how they recommend</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.950" end="00:06:51.560" style="s2">going about that is to be virtuous live</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.890" end="00:06:53.510" style="s2">in virtue and they talk about the four</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.560" end="00:06:57.040" style="s2">cardinal virtues just like Christianity</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.040" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">courage temperance and justice and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.400" end="00:07:07.910" style="s2">most important one is is practical</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:10.010" style="s2">reason you know prudence and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.910" end="00:07:12.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of like they have these</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.010" end="00:07:15.650" style="s2">sort of reasoned heuristics I&#39;d call</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.140" end="00:07:18.410" style="s2">them like the bed walk bedrock one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.650" end="00:07:20.810" style="s2">that dichotomy of control radically</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.410" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">focus on what&#39;s in your control and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.810" end="00:07:25.250" style="s2">don&#39;t concern yourself with what is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:27.320" style="s2">in your control so there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.250" end="00:07:29.450" style="s2">like psychological localism happens when</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.320" end="00:07:32.810" style="s2">that occurs and other principles like</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.450" end="00:07:34.370" style="s2">negative visualization focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.810" end="00:07:37.550" style="s2">worst case scenario come to terms with</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.370" end="00:07:39.950" style="s2">it be okay with it and the more that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.550" end="00:07:43.370" style="s2">they love thy fate right so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.950" end="00:07:45.350" style="s2">happens to you act as if you wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.370" end="00:07:49.310" style="s2">in your own life you know if you had God</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.350" end="00:07:50.900" style="s2">mode or whatever and so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.310" end="00:07:54.470" style="s2">like the kind of skeleton propositional</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.900" end="00:07:57.380" style="s2">skeleton of stoicism and the delicious</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.470" end="00:07:59.750" style="s2">thing for me it&#39;s more of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.380" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">entrepreneurial stoic or spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.750" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">entrepreneurial a spiritual entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:08.390" style="s2">this realm is that stoicism is a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:10.850" style="s2">philosophy to find itself in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.390" end="00:08:15.320" style="s2">to be discovered and I say this because</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.850" end="00:08:17.419" style="s2">like I think like 90% of the tech stoic</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.320" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">literature would disappeared we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.419" end="00:08:21.950" style="s2">have access to it we have access to some</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:23.720" style="s2">of the like the modern Roman Stoics not</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.950" end="00:08:26.450" style="s2">modern almost looks but like the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.720" end="00:08:28.880" style="s2">Stoics like Marcus Aurelius Seneca</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.450" end="00:08:31.640" style="s2">epictetus but most of the texts we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.880" end="00:08:35.300" style="s2">have access to and we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.640" end="00:08:37.010" style="s2">how they practiced like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.300" end="00:08:39.349" style="s2">some lineages like Orthodox Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.010" end="00:08:40.789" style="s2">or Buddhist ik traditions where we kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.349" end="00:08:43.070" style="s2">of know what it looks like still we</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.789" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know what stoicism looks like how</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.070" end="00:08:45.800" style="s2">its practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">and we can pretend we know we can like</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.800" end="00:08:50.899" style="s2">but know it&#39;s time to reinvent it in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">opinion it&#39;s time to discover it ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.899" end="00:08:58.579" style="s2">what it wants from us I love that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.170" end="00:09:04.089" style="s2">there&#39;s some things that come up for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.579" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">there as you the idea that you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.089" end="00:09:09.950" style="s2">ruminate on the worst possible scenario</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">and come to terms with it I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.950" end="00:09:14.360" style="s2">professional action sports athlete and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:17.269" style="s2">paraglide pilot and a Highliner and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.360" end="00:09:19.459" style="s2">that&#39;s just something that I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.269" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">been talking a lot about lately</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.459" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">especially in the midst of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:31.660" style="s2">like looming worst-case scenarios is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">really taking a hard look at what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.660" end="00:09:36.860" style="s2">what all the possible outcomes are and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:38.570" style="s2">recently had a friend on the podcast his</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.860" end="00:09:41.769" style="s2">name is Matt blank he&#39;s a BASE jumper</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.570" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">and a deep thinker and he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.769" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">levity on the far side of tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.560" end="00:09:55.570" style="s2">you know that was in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:59.410" style="s2">laughing at people who died BASE jumping</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.570" end="00:10:05.209" style="s2">pretty much which is like a pretty dark</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.410" end="00:10:06.920" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s something it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.209" end="00:10:10.540" style="s2">levity that base jumpers used to almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.920" end="00:10:13.130" style="s2">insulate them from the tragedy that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.540" end="00:10:14.990" style="s2">surrounds them at every jump the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.130" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">potential tragedy that surrounds them at</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.990" end="00:10:20.420" style="s2">every jump and so that&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">like one thing that comes up for me that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.420" end="00:10:29.390" style="s2">I see in like the culture that I live in</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:31.790" style="s2">that is some kind of stoic embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.390" end="00:10:33.529" style="s2">and I totally agree I love the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.790" end="00:10:35.089" style="s2">you don&#39;t like to talk about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.529" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">because philosophy is something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.089" end="00:10:42.370" style="s2">ought be embodied not just talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">and I think that right now we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.370" end="00:10:47.720" style="s2">crisis of virtue signaling and a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:51.470" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.720" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">100% and what I like about what you just</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.470" end="00:10:57.829" style="s2">said is I noticed people who gravitated</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:59.749" style="s2">to the stoic group here in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.829" end="00:11:02.329" style="s2">or people who gravitate to stoicism in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.749" end="00:11:04.540" style="s2">general people from the military people</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.329" end="00:11:06.799" style="s2">from like doctors extreme sports</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.540" end="00:11:08.799" style="s2">entrepreneurs people who have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.799" end="00:11:13.489" style="s2">with a high level of uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.799" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">they naturally build their stoic muscle</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.489" end="00:11:17.660" style="s2">if you will just doing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:19.999" style="s2">doing doing their passion right you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.660" end="00:11:22.759" style="s2">to be stoic at least in that area that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.999" end="00:11:25.309" style="s2">localized area right so imagine your</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.759" end="00:11:27.889" style="s2">stoicism in that extreme sport what was</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.309" end="00:11:29.269" style="s2">it again it&#39;s that was BASE jumping BASE</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.889" end="00:11:31.129" style="s2">jumping imagine this ptosis that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.269" end="00:11:32.809" style="s2">experienced during BASE jumping and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.129" end="00:11:35.119" style="s2">just globalize it to every aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.809" end="00:11:37.189" style="s2">your life yeah all right and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.119" end="00:11:39.049" style="s2">they say a peer who know that philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.189" end="00:11:42.379" style="s2">is a way of life it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.049" end="00:11:45.999" style="s2">we talk about or just talk about we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.379" end="00:11:48.470" style="s2">breathe it yeah I totally agree and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.999" end="00:11:51.109" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.470" end="00:11:55.549" style="s2">concept but at the same time I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.109" end="00:12:00.350" style="s2">that right now we are you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.549" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">that a I think that in general people in</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.350" end="00:12:04.669" style="s2">this like big nap that we&#39;ve been taking</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">since world war ii where everything has</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.669" end="00:12:10.549" style="s2">been so good and the garden has been so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:14.929" style="s2">fruitful that everyone has been so</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.549" end="00:12:16.459" style="s2">relaxed that i think that some of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.929" end="00:12:18.169" style="s2">concepts that we&#39;re talking about are</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.459" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">just completely and totally foreign to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.169" end="00:12:26.749" style="s2">people that philosophy as a practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:31.189" style="s2">philosophy as a intellectual exercise to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.749" end="00:12:33.379" style="s2">begin with is lost on people it&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.189" end="00:12:34.999" style="s2">just haven&#39;t been exposed to it and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.379" end="00:12:39.189" style="s2">know here we are we&#39;re talking about one</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.999" end="00:12:44.329" style="s2">small sect of philosophy that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.189" end="00:12:45.949" style="s2">ancient roots and deep practicality but</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.329" end="00:12:48.799" style="s2">people are completely and totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.949" end="00:12:50.779" style="s2">unfamiliar with even the terminology or</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.799" end="00:12:53.829" style="s2">the mental exercise let alone the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.779" end="00:12:57.949" style="s2">embodiment so I think there is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.829" end="00:13:04.189" style="s2">importance to talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.949" end="00:13:08.400" style="s2">philosophies that we use to to guide the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.189" end="00:13:10.770" style="s2">principles that modify our behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.400" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">because I think that most people have</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.770" end="00:13:17.220" style="s2">been watching Rick and Morty for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">while and I think they need to be</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.030" end="00:13:57.240" style="s2">afterwards it the the basic premise</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:14:01.380" style="s2">there is you know the culture war is not</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.080" end="00:14:13.620" style="s2">like a left versus right it&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.130" end="00:14:15.180" style="s2">called a multipolar war not I call they</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.620" end="00:14:16.860" style="s2">just took that term from international</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.180" end="00:14:20.670" style="s2">relations and applied it to the culture</p>

<p begin="00:14:46.280" end="00:14:54.390" style="s2">if you kind of look back in history</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">anytime there was a multipolar World</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.390" end="00:15:00.360" style="s2">Order it was always before a massive war</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">like World War 1 World War two</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.360" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">they had a multipolar World Order and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:07.020" style="s2">kind of leads to chaos when you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:10.380" style="s2">that like if you have a bipolar order if</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.020" end="00:15:12.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like us a Soviet Union or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.380" end="00:15:14.850" style="s2">like packs or unipolar is like Pax</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.900" end="00:15:16.620" style="s2">Britannica or packets Americana there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.850" end="00:15:18.810" style="s2">some kind of stability but if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.620" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">multipolar it&#39;s like oh you know danger</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.810" end="00:15:26.709" style="s2">coming up and I think we&#39;re there now</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:27.940" style="s2">and so why I mentioned this is that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.709" end="00:15:29.769" style="s2">can go down that threat to the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.940" end="00:15:34.269" style="s2">danger threat but why I mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.769" end="00:15:37.450" style="s2">is my postmodern proclivities the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.269" end="00:15:40.839" style="s2">ability to what I said earlier method</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.450" end="00:15:42.250" style="s2">act various reality tunnels and to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.839" end="00:15:44.110" style="s2">point where you can pastor like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.250" end="00:15:46.029" style="s2">illogical Turing test or just feel what</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.110" end="00:15:47.860" style="s2">they feel when they believe what they</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.029" end="00:15:52.089" style="s2">believe I think that&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.860" end="00:15:54.510" style="s2">skill set to have and why I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.089" end="00:15:57.790" style="s2">this is that a lot of people get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.510" end="00:16:01.000" style="s2">with the word philosophy all right like</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.790" end="00:16:02.950" style="s2">oh I&#39;ve learned all these uh terms and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.000" end="00:16:04.620" style="s2">concepts and all this shit and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.950" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s this own virtue</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.620" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">signaling there with philosophers and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:10.510" style="s2">feel this in the modern stoic movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:12.190" style="s2">there&#39;s like a pretension they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.510" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">oh I gotta I gotta use these words and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.190" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">everything a lot of people I noticed are</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">intimidated by the word philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:22.420" style="s2">because their egos are not associated</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:24.850" style="s2">with philosophizing or the terms that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.420" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">they use so I&#39;m very comfortable with my</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.850" end="00:16:30.310" style="s2">postmodern proclivities is to use</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:33.790" style="s2">different terms like being real okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.310" end="00:16:35.290" style="s2">like just being real and that&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.790" end="00:16:37.029" style="s2">I think it&#39;s more important to model it</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.290" end="00:16:38.890" style="s2">and allow other people to see you model</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.029" end="00:16:42.850" style="s2">it like what I&#39;m trying to do right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.890" end="00:16:45.220" style="s2">so yeah and why I mentioned all that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.850" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2">this is like if we want to like sell</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.220" end="00:16:49.720" style="s2">this or scale it up to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.100" end="00:16:51.310" style="s2">watching Rick and Morty and I never</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.720" end="00:16:54.190" style="s2">watch that show by her is good I saw</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.310" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">like I had no judgment on it but if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.190" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">want to kind of like bring it to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.910" style="s2">people then we might have to use</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">different languages we have to untether</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.910" end="00:17:06.610" style="s2">our ego from these these concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">then we got to talk to people in a real</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.610" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">way that to me is true philosophy I</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.709" end="00:17:19.689" style="s2">think that touches on the rich Bartlett</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.530" end="00:17:24.040" style="s2">and Sarah Nass this power of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.689" end="00:17:25.809" style="s2">authenticity in this and honestly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.040" end="00:17:28.750" style="s2">something that is really like relatively</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.809" end="00:17:34.120" style="s2">new in my life because I feel like for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.750" end="00:17:36.130" style="s2">long time I have been are a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.120" end="00:17:39.820" style="s2">my intellectual evolution</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.130" end="00:17:42.670" style="s2">involved like objective truth just being</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.820" end="00:17:46.410" style="s2">like the tip of the spear and the like</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.670" end="00:17:50.790" style="s2">the the highest part of the pyramid and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.410" end="00:17:53.620" style="s2">it led me to kind of just discredit</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.790" end="00:17:55.870" style="s2">subjective truths from people and from</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.620" end="00:17:57.940" style="s2">myself and I think I like dissolved a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.870" end="00:17:59.290" style="s2">big part of myself there and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.940" end="00:18:05.560" style="s2">lot of me that was hidden because of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.290" end="00:18:07.330" style="s2">that and now as we I think we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.560" end="00:18:09.100" style="s2">like on all fronts we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.330" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">just like in our embodied experience we</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.100" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">can see how that&#39;s important and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">just like being vulnerable and on</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:18.730" style="s2">authentic even with ourselves even in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:22.060" style="s2">our journal is like a powerful tool as</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.730" end="00:18:23.590" style="s2">well as like interpersonally and even</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.060" end="00:18:27.670" style="s2">like the scientific literature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.590" end="00:18:30.520" style="s2">coming out you know Sarah Nass brought</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.670" end="00:18:36.760" style="s2">up this study that was done on this</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.520" end="00:18:40.510" style="s2">shale oil rig that hired emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.760" end="00:18:43.990" style="s2">intelligence and vulnerability training</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.510" end="00:18:47.650" style="s2">for their oil rig workers and like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.990" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">incidence of fatal accidents went down</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.650" end="00:18:54.630" style="s2">like 80 percent on the oil rigs so this</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:58.410" style="s2">kind of vulnerability and subjective</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.630" end="00:19:01.810" style="s2">truth is really becoming a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.410" end="00:19:04.510" style="s2">mainstream thing in my mind as well as I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.810" end="00:19:06.870" style="s2">see it externally more and more the one</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.510" end="00:19:09.490" style="s2">thing that I want to go back to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.870" end="00:19:11.290" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.490" end="00:19:14.610" style="s2">exactly the term that you use a method</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.290" end="00:19:16.690" style="s2">something where you are feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.610" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">like you&#39;re putting yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.690" end="00:19:21.450" style="s2">shoes of someone else&#39;s perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:23.800" style="s2">understand what they feel with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.450" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">worldview that they have what is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.800" end="00:19:28.090" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about that for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">sure yeah and I through I recognized I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.090" end="00:19:34.420" style="s2">threw a bunch of crazy terms out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:39.310" style="s2">and a rapid-fire way and I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.420" end="00:19:42.790" style="s2">also say that I&#39;m glad to be here now at</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.310" end="00:19:44.860" style="s2">the beginning you recall I said I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.790" end="00:19:48.460" style="s2">want to be here but I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.860" end="00:19:50.259" style="s2">and so thank you for the invite yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.460" end="00:19:53.269" style="s2">answer your question about</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.259" end="00:19:55.460" style="s2">the method acting thing was it acting</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.269" end="00:19:57.980" style="s2">yeah I familiar with method acting the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.460" end="00:20:01.129" style="s2">technique and um I think that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.980" end="00:20:04.399" style="s2">actually come across this but I died the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.129" end="00:20:08.840" style="s2">term seems new to me right so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.399" end="00:20:11.210" style="s2">like a an acting technique where if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.840" end="00:20:12.769" style="s2">want to really feel the character that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.210" end="00:20:15.559" style="s2">you&#39;re playing if you&#39;re an actor right</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.769" end="00:20:17.299" style="s2">then you you kind of like put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.559" end="00:20:20.330" style="s2">in the motional reality that that actor</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.299" end="00:20:22.190" style="s2">is in or that character would be in so</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.330" end="00:20:23.480" style="s2">you kind of like I think I&#39;ve various</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.190" end="00:20:26.149" style="s2">techniques I imagine but you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.480" end="00:20:27.769" style="s2">conjure up memories of past times where</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.149" end="00:20:32.299" style="s2">you felt that so you can kind of feel it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.769" end="00:20:35.470" style="s2">when you&#39;re acting in that role and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.299" end="00:20:37.639" style="s2">I meet I mean I&#39;m repurposing that for</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.470" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">understanding all these what I call</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.639" end="00:20:40.940" style="s2">nomadic tribes like you know these</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:45.169" style="s2">different kind of philosophies in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.940" end="00:20:46.759" style="s2">wild so step one in my opinion actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.169" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">it could be step two I don&#39;t know one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.759" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">the steps is having the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:58.879" style="s2">articulate their views in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:00.289" style="s2">they feel fully understood all right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.879" end="00:21:02.779" style="s2">that&#39;s step one just on a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.289" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">level right make sure you your map of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.779" end="00:21:08.120" style="s2">their ideas is correspondent to their</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:10.100" style="s2">map well that&#39;s likely true that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.120" end="00:21:12.049" style="s2">being able to argue the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.100" end="00:21:14.600" style="s2">the argument right exactly right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.049" end="00:21:19.129" style="s2">having that capacity is one of the steps</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.600" end="00:21:22.039" style="s2">but then the other step is actually sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.129" end="00:21:26.570" style="s2">and allow those propositions to sink in</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.039" end="00:21:28.580" style="s2">and feel how the world feels when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.570" end="00:21:30.769" style="s2">believe them to be true</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.580" end="00:21:34.340" style="s2">right and you can do this exercise with</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.769" end="00:21:36.259" style="s2">social justice activists manosphere in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.340" end="00:21:40.279" style="s2">cells whatever and you actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.259" end="00:21:42.019" style="s2">certain things right yeah this is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.279" end="00:21:43.970" style="s2">going further than just being able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.019" end="00:21:46.850" style="s2">play devil&#39;s advocate but actually like</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.970" end="00:21:48.860" style="s2">beginning to embody for at least a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.850" end="00:21:52.190" style="s2">moment the ideology that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.860" end="00:21:55.639" style="s2">about yes exactly and then if you can do</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.190" end="00:21:57.020" style="s2">that then you can speak to them really</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.639" end="00:22:00.140" style="s2">speak to them not you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.020" end="00:22:02.330" style="s2">pretend to speak with them and so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.140" end="00:22:03.950" style="s2">think that is a really important skill</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.330" end="00:22:08.270" style="s2">set to have especially in this liminal</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.950" end="00:22:12.290" style="s2">space Wow yeah we&#39;re stomachs grumbling</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.270" end="00:22:14.990" style="s2">right now so I might mute myself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.290" end="00:22:20.380" style="s2">that is such a powerful tool and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.990" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s been like hinted at in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.380" end="00:22:25.490" style="s2">discourse of like being able to like</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:27.740" style="s2">open mindedness is being able to like</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.490" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">consider the other point of view and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.740" end="00:22:33.650" style="s2">people tend to do it just as far as they</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">can like find a crack in it to argue</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.650" end="00:22:39.640" style="s2">against it and it&#39;s like this it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:43.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a combat technique as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.640" end="00:22:46.090" style="s2">some kind of way to have a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.040" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">understanding and a broader view and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.090" end="00:22:55.730" style="s2">sympathetic a sympathetic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:23:00.140" style="s2">between someone else who has a different</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.730" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">way of thinking and I it just brings me</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.140" end="00:23:04.760" style="s2">to something that I&#39;ve been just</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:08.950" style="s2">ruminant ruminating on over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.760" end="00:23:15.320" style="s2">over so much lately is just the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.950" end="00:23:18.170" style="s2">fighting just the reality that I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.320" end="00:23:21.110" style="s2">that is not people using their</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.170" end="00:23:26.180" style="s2">intelligence and their cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.110" end="00:23:29.270" style="s2">their words to like move forward but</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.180" end="00:23:36.830" style="s2">merely as a way to weaponize their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.270" end="00:23:41.390" style="s2">opinions at another it is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.830" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2">lib tard or you know the Lib tardes</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.390" end="00:23:47.500" style="s2">versus the Trump supporters it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:51.880" style="s2">there is none of this embodied</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.500" end="00:23:54.350" style="s2">empathetic method acting which</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.880" end="00:23:57.049" style="s2">experientially we know method acting to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.350" end="00:23:59.269" style="s2">be something that is so viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.049" end="00:24:01.700" style="s2">powerful like when you watch the movie</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.269" end="00:24:03.950" style="s2">Joker and you see Joaquin Phoenix who is</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.700" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">like become someone else it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:11.389" style="s2">there&#39;s something like so powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.450" end="00:24:15.340" style="s2">almost like terrifying that is like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.389" end="00:24:19.130" style="s2">person has has like sat with another</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.340" end="00:24:21.139" style="s2">reality in a way for so long and in such</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.130" end="00:24:25.130" style="s2">a profound way that it like has</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.139" end="00:24:27.409" style="s2">literally changed them and we&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.130" end="00:24:34.279" style="s2">stories from Hollywood who have like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.409" end="00:24:36.440" style="s2">know stories of like of Jim Carrey when</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.440" end="00:24:43.639" style="s2">played that other comedian and Andy</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.220" end="00:24:45.889" style="s2">Kaufman Andy Kaufman and the story goes</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.639" end="00:24:48.350" style="s2">that like during the entire production</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.889" end="00:24:50.809" style="s2">he never came out of character and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.350" end="00:24:53.299" style="s2">was like almost like detrimental to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.809" end="00:24:55.460" style="s2">a number of his relationships because he</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.299" end="00:24:57.740" style="s2">was like so embodied in this other</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.460" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">person&#39;s reality that he like became</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.740" end="00:25:05.870" style="s2">them so we know experientially that this</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:09.620" style="s2">kind of being with another person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.870" end="00:25:12.049" style="s2">emotional reality or their or you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.620" end="00:25:13.820" style="s2">not just walking in their shoes per se</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.049" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">but actually like kind of like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.820" end="00:25:17.570" style="s2">like look through their eyes and see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:21.559" style="s2">world through their lenses and try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.570" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">feel what they would feel if if that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.559" end="00:25:27.049" style="s2">were the case if they had that ideology</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:28.760" style="s2">and those emotions and those experiences</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.049" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">we know this to be a really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.760" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">powerful thing and yet we I find us to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:40.340" style="s2">be absolutely just mired in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:43.010" style="s2">without resolution no desire to have any</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.340" end="00:25:47.270" style="s2">kind of resolution only conflict for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.010" end="00:25:49.910" style="s2">addiction of conflict right I am</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:52.850" style="s2">optimistic now and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.910" end="00:25:55.130" style="s2">you know I I did an analysis on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.850" end="00:25:56.660" style="s2">this on that culture war mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.130" end="00:25:59.930" style="s2">and the culture were 2.0 white paper</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.660" end="00:26:02.300" style="s2">that I mentioned maybe I can come back</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.930" end="00:26:04.460" style="s2">and chat about it but I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.300" end="00:26:06.770" style="s2">about that like I never really put this</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.460" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">connection together but when I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.770" end="00:26:10.790" style="s2">writing that white paper and we had this</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:13.340" style="s2">spreadsheet of like 32 different reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.790" end="00:26:16.460" style="s2">tunnels like tribes and you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.340" end="00:26:19.910" style="s2">tried my best to feel into each of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.460" end="00:26:21.260" style="s2">and I did have a mini breakdown on</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.910" end="00:26:26.050" style="s2">writing that paper like a mental</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:28.970" style="s2">breakdown what helped me out of it was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.050" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">Robert Anton Wilson he&#39;s a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.970" end="00:26:32.870" style="s2">agnostic and it&#39;s like I&#39;ve used sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:35.000" style="s2">that because a healthy post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.870" end="00:26:39.740" style="s2">being able to sit and that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.000" end="00:26:42.680" style="s2">liminal state without running into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.740" end="00:26:45.020" style="s2">certain narrative out of fear but I also</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.680" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">just what just came to my right now when</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.020" end="00:26:51.920" style="s2">you were talking is how potentially my</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:54.710" style="s2">stoicism afforded me of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.920" end="00:26:55.970" style="s2">do that without completely losing my</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.710" end="00:26:58.760" style="s2">mind or maybe I did lose my mind I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.970" end="00:27:02.590" style="s2">know but like you had like the has some</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.760" end="00:27:02.590" style="s2">semblance of sanity right like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.040" end="00:27:08.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a that the process of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.650" end="00:27:11.540" style="s2">if you follow the stoic algorithm if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.630" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">will it naturally leads to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.540" end="00:27:18.680" style="s2">acceptance commitment therapy calls</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:22.280" style="s2">cognitive diffusion so your thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.680" end="00:27:23.690" style="s2">your emotions get separated because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.280" end="00:27:25.190" style="s2">think a lot of problem is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.690" end="00:27:27.590" style="s2">trigger words right and every matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.190" end="00:27:29.240" style="s2">tribe has sacred values that trigger</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.590" end="00:27:30.430" style="s2">them where they&#39;re on their left or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.240" end="00:27:34.490" style="s2">right so everyone&#39;s getting triggered</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.430" end="00:27:37.280" style="s2">because my read is that their emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.490" end="00:27:39.620" style="s2">reality is so enmeshed with their</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.280" end="00:27:40.580" style="s2">propositional reality and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.620" end="00:27:41.660" style="s2">still exert not really in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.580" end="00:27:44.030" style="s2">where I didn&#39;t include them on the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.660" end="00:27:46.280" style="s2">original mimetic tribe list is because</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.030" end="00:27:48.560" style="s2">the Stoics not the capacity just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.280" end="00:27:51.530" style="s2">great distance between the two that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.560" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">one of the pillars right yeah and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.530" end="00:27:56.060" style="s2">mike my kind of like criticism i guess i</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:57.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s criticism on the modern</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.060" end="00:27:58.970" style="s2">stoic movement like my kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.680" end="00:28:01.250" style="s2">black sheep of the community a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.970" end="00:28:03.130" style="s2">bit but like that out of the unknown met</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.250" end="00:28:05.860" style="s2">a weirdo but like</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.130" end="00:28:07.750" style="s2">my I guess but I don&#39;t resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.860" end="00:28:10.180" style="s2">modern stoic community is that I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.750" end="00:28:11.260" style="s2">feel like they stay there all right they</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.180" end="00:28:12.670" style="s2">just kind of create that distance</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.260" end="00:28:15.130" style="s2">between of thoughts and then their</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.670" end="00:28:17.800" style="s2">motion they stay there but I like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.130" end="00:28:19.330" style="s2">idea of turning around you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.800" end="00:28:20.950" style="s2">like now that you have that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.330" end="00:28:22.840" style="s2">turn around and build a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.950" end="00:28:25.030" style="s2">with each one of those emotional</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.840" end="00:28:27.220" style="s2">realities mmm all right and if you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.030" end="00:28:29.920" style="s2">build a good relationship with fear love</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.220" end="00:28:33.220" style="s2">all that type of stuff and view each</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.920" end="00:28:35.380" style="s2">emotional state as a friend trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.220" end="00:28:37.720" style="s2">give you advice but having the prudence</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.380" end="00:28:39.010" style="s2">to recognize that even though they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.720" end="00:28:41.050" style="s2">friend they don&#39;t always give the best</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.010" end="00:28:42.690" style="s2">advice I&#39;m gonna have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.050" end="00:28:55.930" style="s2">with each one of those emotional states</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.690" end="00:28:58.930" style="s2">then good shit can happen and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.930" end="00:29:00.940" style="s2">why I feel really called to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.930" end="00:29:04.060" style="s2">stoicism I guess or maybe embody it</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:07.060" style="s2">publicly where I didn&#39;t before because</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.060" end="00:29:10.270" style="s2">we&#39;re living in this ever since Cove it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.060" end="00:29:12.070" style="s2">happened tomorrow has died even though</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:14.500" style="s2">maybe hasn&#39;t died for everyone it kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.070" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">of died because no one knows what</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.500" end="00:29:17.850" style="s2">tomorrow will bring right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:21.570" style="s2">living in this radically uncertain state</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.850" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">and then I think it&#39;s gonna keep getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.570" end="00:29:27.460" style="s2">more liminal it&#39;s gonna keep getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:30.430" style="s2">more crazy how can you set a proper goal</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.460" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">in this in this state you know but</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.430" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">confidently like a smart goal how can</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:42.700" style="s2">you set one and so I feel called to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">stoic publicly in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:50.170" style="s2">hence the stoah yeah I think that the</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.170" end="00:29:57.730" style="s2">like a psychological standpoint are just</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.780" end="00:29:59.890" style="s2">really super healthy and they the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.730" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">that you would separate your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.890" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">and your thoughts you would separate</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:06.790" style="s2">your identity from your emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:10.710" style="s2">your thoughts all of these things is</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.030" end="00:30:36.040" style="s2">front and center view but the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.940" end="00:30:38.290" style="s2">uncertainty has always been there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.040" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">yeah I understand yeah it has never it</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.290" end="00:30:44.170" style="s2">it has never been anything else than</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:45.790" style="s2">uncertain like we&#39;re all you know you</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.790" end="00:30:52.990" style="s2">for you now but it the certainty of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.220" end="00:30:55.510" style="s2">tomorrow has always been some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.990" end="00:30:59.110" style="s2">illusion some kind of construct yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.510" end="00:31:01.420" style="s2">that&#39;s really well put yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.110" end="00:31:05.170" style="s2">sort of like this this is a state this</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.420" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">crisis is an opportunity to wake up to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.170" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">that reality it really is it really is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:29.140" style="s2">the other night I did just getting deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.420" end="00:31:30.700" style="s2">now I had been given this from a really</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.140" end="00:31:38.800" style="s2">trusted friend I had been given this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.700" end="00:31:40.660" style="s2">this changa this activated DMT and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.800" end="00:31:42.370" style="s2">just kind of like I just had it for</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.660" end="00:31:45.480" style="s2">months and months and months and I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.370" end="00:31:51.100" style="s2">like had never really like had the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.480" end="00:31:53.290" style="s2">calling to to kind of go on that journey</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.100" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">but the other night it was just like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.290" end="00:31:57.580" style="s2">called him he I was out camping by</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:59.860" style="s2">myself on a mountain and it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.580" end="00:32:02.290" style="s2">kind of called to me and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.860" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">you said about where the Stoics stopped</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.290" end="00:32:11.500" style="s2">at separating their emotions from their</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:13.870" style="s2">thoughts where you want to take it a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.500" end="00:32:17.290" style="s2">step further by turning around and build</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.870" end="00:32:19.420" style="s2">relationship with those emotions is was</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.290" end="00:32:22.030" style="s2">like strangely reminiscent of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.420" end="00:32:25.830" style="s2">experience that I had this like really</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.030" end="00:32:29.809" style="s2">profound feeling that I was like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.830" end="00:32:32.549" style="s2">transported to this plane of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.809" end="00:32:35.010" style="s2">where I could see that my own</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.549" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">perspective had been knocked loose and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.010" end="00:32:42.660" style="s2">had like floated around 180 so that my</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:46.020" style="s2">own consciousness could then turn around</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.660" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">and see consciousness as a diffuse</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.020" end="00:32:54.330" style="s2">property that then the following</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:56.700" style="s2">profound realization was that everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.330" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">is relational like I only exist in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.700" end="00:33:06.090" style="s2">relationship to the tree right there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:08.309" style="s2">my girlfriend and as you talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.090" end="00:33:09.990" style="s2">the you know building these</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.309" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">relationships with different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.990" end="00:33:18.750" style="s2">yourself it reminds me of the the rich</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:21.210" style="s2">Bartlett the innermost circle of of of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.750" end="00:33:24.690" style="s2">coming into relationship with each part</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.210" end="00:33:26.460" style="s2">of yourself yeah 100% and then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.690" end="00:33:27.570" style="s2">being in right relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.460" end="00:33:29.160" style="s2">part of yourself because we&#39;re always in</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.570" end="00:33:33.270" style="s2">a relationship but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.160" end="00:33:37.740" style="s2">relationship could be pathological all</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.740" end="00:33:43.650" style="s2">sort of like that&#39;s going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.309" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">bedrock of Stoicism you know being right</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.419" end="00:34:08.310" style="s2">like just globalize that to every aspect</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.130" end="00:34:11.100" style="s2">of your life that is philosophy mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.310" end="00:34:13.320" style="s2">and you know as you say that being in</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.100" end="00:34:15.740" style="s2">right relationship with reality or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.320" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">first thing that you said was living</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.740" end="00:34:21.149" style="s2">within relationship with nature or being</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:22.679" style="s2">living in accordance with nature as to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.149" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">how the Stoics originally worded it okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.679" end="00:34:28.440" style="s2">perfect and that my my girlfriend is an</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:33.600" style="s2">Ayurvedic practitioner and Ayurveda is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.440" end="00:34:36.179" style="s2">essentially living in and in right</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.600" end="00:34:38.369" style="s2">relationship with nature the the rhythms</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.179" end="00:34:41.580" style="s2">of your body the rhythms of the seasons</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.369" end="00:34:42.899" style="s2">the the seasonal foods all these</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.580" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.899" end="00:34:51.089" style="s2">and there&#39;s like this you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:54.119" style="s2">the Zen idea that the truth is actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.089" end="00:34:55.980" style="s2">this like unnameable it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.119" end="00:34:58.829" style="s2">unnameable you can&#39;t even you can&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.980" end="00:35:01.859" style="s2">it you can only say what it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.829" end="00:35:04.950" style="s2">or you can only like point to it and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.859" end="00:35:08.130" style="s2">right your example of what the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.950" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">say and then a slight variation is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.130" end="00:35:13.260" style="s2">Greenhalgh says and then like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:15.390" style="s2">variation is what is what I ate a says</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.260" end="00:35:19.319" style="s2">about it and then my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.390" end="00:35:21.690" style="s2">anecdote is like like as I do extreme</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.319" end="00:35:23.460" style="s2">sports like in a paraglider I&#39;m flying</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.690" end="00:35:26.460" style="s2">deep in the mountains like if I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.460" end="00:35:28.740" style="s2">have some illusory concept it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.460" end="00:35:31.470" style="s2">actually map on to reality like my life</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.740" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">is literally in danger like I died from</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.470" end="00:35:37.890" style="s2">that kind of shit so being in right</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">relationship with reality is like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.890" end="00:35:43.670" style="s2">like that is a that is pretty close to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:47.190" style="s2">pointing at like the ultimate truth like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.670" end="00:35:50.520" style="s2">the right relationship to to reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.190" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">right and you yeah go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.520" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s um what&#39;s coming up right</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:57.089" style="s2">there like you know the finger and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:00.630" style="s2">moon type metaphor that you&#39;re just kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.089" end="00:36:02.849" style="s2">of like gesture towards yeah and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.630" end="00:36:06.119" style="s2">that too and I was baptized as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.849" end="00:36:11.450" style="s2">Orthodox Christian and Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.119" end="00:36:13.950" style="s2">Christianity there-there pan in theistic</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.450" end="00:36:16.049" style="s2">so there&#39;s pantheistic which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.950" end="00:36:19.410" style="s2">reality is God and pan in theistic is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.049" end="00:36:22.380" style="s2">reality is God is reality in outside of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.410" end="00:36:25.500" style="s2">reality right and so when I was baptized</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.380" end="00:36:26.910" style="s2">in that religion and was brought up I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.500" end="00:36:28.890" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really brought up in it it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.910" end="00:36:32.130" style="s2">like you know my babushka and my grandma</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.890" end="00:36:35.039" style="s2">you know like there was a sense that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.130" end="00:36:37.079" style="s2">was always swimming in reality right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.039" end="00:36:40.890" style="s2">their goal Orthodox Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.079" end="00:36:43.470" style="s2">theosis unification with God right which</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.890" end="00:36:44.760" style="s2">is very similar with stoicism my</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.470" end="00:36:46.680" style="s2">becoming right relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.760" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like kind of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.680" end="00:36:51.059" style="s2">the intimacy there with reality with God</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:52.559" style="s2">or wherever kind of metaphysics you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.059" end="00:36:54.300" style="s2">to use and again my postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.559" end="00:36:57.630" style="s2">proclivities allows me to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.300" end="00:37:00.390" style="s2">with both depending who I talk to and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.630" end="00:37:02.700" style="s2">and one thing I think is so critical and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.390" end="00:37:06.060" style="s2">Jordan Peterson talks about this too is</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.700" end="00:37:08.460" style="s2">a truthfulness being truthful and my</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.060" end="00:37:10.530" style="s2">issue an issue I shouldn&#39;t say this with</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.460" end="00:37:12.870" style="s2">I guess more accurate sin my annoyance</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.530" end="00:37:14.910" style="s2">with atheistic types especially the new</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.870" end="00:37:16.860" style="s2">atheist types and a lot of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.910" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">stoic movement they&#39;re all new atheists</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.860" end="00:37:21.000" style="s2">sort of LARPing as Stoics and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.350" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my uncheered able I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.000" end="00:37:25.250" style="s2">throw some shade out there so I get some</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.350" end="00:37:27.540" style="s2">heat from it and see how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.250" end="00:37:31.560" style="s2">charitable interpretation of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.540" end="00:37:34.530" style="s2">them and hold on I just have to say it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.560" end="00:37:37.950" style="s2">again they are new atheist LARPing as</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.530" end="00:37:39.720" style="s2">Stoics that&#39;s just too good I hope you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.950" end="00:37:41.160" style="s2">die I kind of didn&#39;t want you to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.720" end="00:37:42.510" style="s2">it again I just wanted like disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.160" end="00:37:44.790" style="s2">now that&#39;s gonna be like the pig or the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.510" end="00:37:51.840" style="s2">title of the I wanna make a meme out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.790" end="00:37:54.540" style="s2">it but it&#39;s do it there&#39;s even though I</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.840" end="00:37:56.580" style="s2">confess there&#39;s an uncharitable element</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.540" end="00:38:00.300" style="s2">there and that uncharitable niskanen</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.580" end="00:38:01.710" style="s2">Uyen sigh have so I&#39;ll gladly take the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.300" end="00:38:03.690" style="s2">heat and hopefully some productive</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.710" end="00:38:06.360" style="s2">conversations will emerge from this but</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.690" end="00:38:07.980" style="s2">the well I brought that up is that what</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.360" end="00:38:09.000" style="s2">I find a lot of people in the atheistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.980" end="00:38:13.160" style="s2">community especially the new atheist</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.000" end="00:38:16.410" style="s2">communities they really almost like</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.160" end="00:38:19.170" style="s2">obsessed with truth right this concept</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.410" end="00:38:20.700" style="s2">of truth and the way I hold how they</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.170" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">hold it to be a good performative</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.700" end="00:38:24.390" style="s2">agnostic here is that what philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.600" style="s2">call the correspondence theory of truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.390" end="00:38:29.910" style="s2">so you have models of reality and if</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.600" end="00:38:32.730" style="s2">your models of reality map over and are</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.910" end="00:38:34.620" style="s2">accurate to reality then you arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.730" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">the truth and the best way to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.620" end="00:38:38.670" style="s2">the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:40.440" style="s2">make sure the study is replicated and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.670" end="00:38:41.910" style="s2">you can memorize in institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.440" end="00:38:44.040" style="s2">pass multiple-choice tests and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.910" end="00:38:47.010" style="s2">all right oh so that that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.040" end="00:38:48.840" style="s2">the truth that&#39;s a little different than</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.010" end="00:38:51.240" style="s2">truthfulness what someone like Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.840" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">is talking about truthfulness is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.240" end="00:38:56.130" style="s2">constant act of mapping your words to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">what you believe to be true in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.130" end="00:39:01.500" style="s2">moment that includes your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:03.390" style="s2">includes your emotional reality uh you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.500" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2">know and then I started this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.390" end="00:39:07.560" style="s2">being truthful great like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:07.859" style="s2">to be here that was that was a truthful</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.560" end="00:39:10.200" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.859" end="00:39:11.849" style="s2">said it and I could tell it maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.200" end="00:39:13.890" style="s2">felt a little bit what the fuck is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.849" end="00:39:16.170" style="s2">guy and then with and it kind of lends</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.890" end="00:39:20.789" style="s2">the delicious conversation it did but it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.170" end="00:39:22.529" style="s2">felt real right and and that is even</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.789" end="00:39:23.759" style="s2">though I I think the truth net</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.529" end="00:39:25.470" style="s2">correspondence to your truth is</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.759" end="00:39:26.759" style="s2">important like I&#39;m not disabusing that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.470" end="00:39:29.430" style="s2">love science you know like I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.759" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">science is important but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.430" end="00:39:34.019" style="s2">talking to we&#39;re talking about what my</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:35.609" style="s2">jam is what I think people really have</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.019" end="00:39:37.319" style="s2">to ground themselves in is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.609" end="00:39:39.859" style="s2">truthfulness muscle because that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.319" end="00:39:42.509" style="s2">truthfulness muscle keeps you loyal</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.859" end="00:39:43.859" style="s2">right keeps you like keeps you loyal</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.509" end="00:39:45.690" style="s2">with reality keeps you in right</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.859" end="00:39:47.069" style="s2">relationship with reality because then</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.690" end="00:39:49.170" style="s2">when you get that egoic machinations</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.069" end="00:39:50.549" style="s2">start emerging then you can a bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.170" end="00:39:52.680" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna lie gonna try to engineer</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.549" end="00:39:54.089" style="s2">shit but when you&#39;re truthful yours in</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.680" end="00:39:58.559" style="s2">the moment just saying whatever wants to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.089" end="00:40:00.539" style="s2">be said and that is how I think one</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.559" end="00:40:01.430" style="s2">maintains right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.539" end="00:40:05.730" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.430" end="00:40:08.549" style="s2">hmm yeah it sounds to me like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.730" end="00:40:10.859" style="s2">it&#39;s almost it&#39;s almost synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.549" end="00:40:14.489" style="s2">the vulnerability of like just speaking</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.859" end="00:40:19.349" style="s2">what is actually real for you in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.489" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">moment right and that&#39;s like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.349" end="00:40:23.849" style="s2">the parallel that comes up for me there</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:29.130" style="s2">and I love that idea I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.849" end="00:40:32.630" style="s2">also there&#39;s like a parallel virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.130" end="00:40:36.019" style="s2">runs along with that that is humility</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.630" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">that is like that the knowingness of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.019" end="00:40:41.489" style="s2">the egoic machinations that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:47.369" style="s2">talking about these like mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.489" end="00:40:51.329" style="s2">arise to posture to position to like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.369" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">game theoretical part of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.329" end="00:40:57.569" style="s2">however condition that is um yeah go</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.089" style="s2">ahead yeah and all these like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.569" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">like oh I&#39;ll be Huff continued my I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.089" end="00:41:04.019" style="s2">charitable is like all these let&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.650" end="00:41:06.329" style="s2">of like intellectual nerds where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.019" end="00:41:07.769" style="s2">just there&#39;s a feeling if you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.329" end="00:41:10.829" style="s2">sink into it there&#39;s like a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.769" end="00:41:11.819" style="s2">knowingness right there&#39;s a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.829" end="00:41:13.769" style="s2">knowingness and there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.819" end="00:41:15.809" style="s2">quality to knowingness there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.769" end="00:41:17.130" style="s2">quality to unknowingness and if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.809" end="00:41:19.140" style="s2">really ground yourself for that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.130" end="00:41:22.789" style="s2">truthfulness muscle you can confidently</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.140" end="00:41:26.339" style="s2">be live in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.789" end="00:41:27.269" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s important because we</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.339" end="00:41:29.339" style="s2">don&#39;t know shit right now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.269" end="00:41:30.959" style="s2">Socrates is going back to Socrates you</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.339" end="00:41:35.489" style="s2">know like the only thing I know is I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.959" end="00:41:37.349" style="s2">know nothing yeah yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.489" end="00:41:41.339" style="s2">important honestly like I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.349" end="00:41:44.099" style="s2">the the truthfulness versus true</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.339" end="00:41:46.019" style="s2">delineation I think I&#39;ll just make here</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.099" end="00:41:49.949" style="s2">quickly for those who aren&#39;t familiar</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.019" end="00:41:52.829" style="s2">with it I think that it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.949" end="00:41:57.650" style="s2">are lost driving and you stop and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.829" end="00:42:01.079" style="s2">ask someone for directions if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.650" end="00:42:03.380" style="s2">misunderstand you or if they honestly</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.079" end="00:42:06.479" style="s2">don&#39;t know but they give you their best</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.380" end="00:42:07.799" style="s2">interpretation of the directions that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.479" end="00:42:09.449" style="s2">you&#39;re asking for and they say yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.799" end="00:42:11.659" style="s2">take your right there and then your</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.449" end="00:42:15.659" style="s2">second left and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.659" end="00:42:17.729" style="s2">they could be wrong objectively wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.659" end="00:42:20.759" style="s2">but could be being truthful they could</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.729" end="00:42:25.650" style="s2">be saying what they genuinely think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.759" end="00:42:28.529" style="s2">true right versus the actual directions</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.650" end="00:42:33.059" style="s2">being true and you can be both true and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.529" end="00:42:37.880" style="s2">truthful simultaneously but the this</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.059" end="00:42:41.729" style="s2">idea of truthfulness as a muscle as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.880" end="00:42:43.829" style="s2">practice of vulnerability that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.729" end="00:42:48.089" style="s2">something that honestly I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.829" end="00:42:51.150" style="s2">a beginner at and I&#39;m practicing it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.089" end="00:42:55.409" style="s2">practicing it just like as much as I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.150" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">and had a he a beautiful reaction</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.409" end="00:43:00.599" style="s2">yesterday as I had an interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:03.539" style="s2">my friend who I literally back spaced me</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.599" end="00:43:06.089" style="s2">giving advice and I just told her how I</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.539" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">was feeling and she just like melted</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.089" end="00:43:13.140" style="s2">yeah and you know this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:17.819" style="s2">vulnerability and our own truthfulness I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.140" end="00:43:19.859" style="s2">really feel is at it is a cornerstone of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.819" end="00:43:23.309" style="s2">this mimetic war that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.859" end="00:43:25.499" style="s2">about I think that in the culture war in</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.309" end="00:43:28.409" style="s2">the mimetic war there is so much</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.499" end="00:43:31.229" style="s2">posturing and bullshit that is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.409" end="00:43:33.630" style="s2">pretending of knowing this regurgitation</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.229" end="00:43:35.000" style="s2">of someone else who they thought had</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.630" end="00:43:37.250" style="s2">authority so they just</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.000" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">educate the authority but in reality</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.250" end="00:43:42.050" style="s2">there&#39;s no knowing there&#39;s no humility</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no you know there&#39;s no method</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.050" end="00:43:46.730" style="s2">acting that has gone in to the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.880" end="00:43:51.890" style="s2">side of it and it&#39;s just this this back</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.730" end="00:43:53.930" style="s2">and forth warfare based in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.890" end="00:43:55.580" style="s2">addiction for warfare and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.930" end="00:44:00.020" style="s2">there&#39;s another element that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.580" end="00:44:02.750" style="s2">the disillusionment that through their</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.020" end="00:44:07.180" style="s2">own knowingness air quotes knowingness</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.750" end="00:44:10.010" style="s2">or certainty they can somehow dispel the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.180" end="00:44:13.690" style="s2">uncertainty and the liminality of life</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.010" end="00:44:17.060" style="s2">itself mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.690" end="00:44:18.590" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s like arrogance there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.060" end="00:44:21.800" style="s2">this like it there&#39;s everyone is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.590" end="00:44:23.870" style="s2">putting on this mask right and Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.800" end="00:44:28.070" style="s2">Ness and I talked about what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.870" end="00:44:34.430" style="s2">like in leadership because I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.070" end="00:44:38.420" style="s2">if you saw Eric Weinstein his talk with</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.430" end="00:44:40.690" style="s2">Danish Martin burger but or with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.420" end="00:44:46.250" style="s2">it&#39;s on Joe Rogan and and Eric says that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.690" end="00:44:48.200" style="s2">that the the the responsible speech that</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.250" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">needs to be made by world leaders right</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.200" end="00:44:54.470" style="s2">now is I am so sorry I just need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:57.110" style="s2">apologize to everyone I didn&#39;t prepare</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.470" end="00:45:00.440" style="s2">for this in accordance with the academic</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.110" end="00:45:02.270" style="s2">papers and I you know I I didn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.440" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">the necessary precautions and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.270" end="00:45:05.180" style="s2">gonna pay for that so I need your</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">apologies I&#39;m gonna resign immediately</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.180" end="00:45:08.150" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna hand it over to someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:10.220" style="s2">who&#39;s in the blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.150" end="00:45:12.980" style="s2">but the reality is that all of our</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.220" end="00:45:15.800" style="s2">leaders have to put on this mask that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.980" end="00:45:17.180" style="s2">pretends that they&#39;re infallible that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.800" end="00:45:21.170" style="s2">they did everything right that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.180" end="00:45:23.240" style="s2">cannot admit any mistakes and what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.170" end="00:45:28.040" style="s2">talked about with Sarah Ness is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.240" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this negative feedback loop that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.040" end="00:45:37.820" style="s2">the people the citizens are not prepared</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:42.530" style="s2">to hear a vulnerable truthful mistake</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.820" end="00:45:45.470" style="s2">ridden speech from a world leader right</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.530" end="00:45:47.020" style="s2">and this is I drew the parallel to our</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.470" end="00:45:49.780" style="s2">medical system where</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.020" end="00:45:53.050" style="s2">the patients are looking for a pill for</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.780" end="00:45:55.840" style="s2">an ill and the doctors get stuck in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.050" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">loop so the doctors are then like</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.840" end="00:46:01.090" style="s2">they&#39;re up against a wall to tell their</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:03.130" style="s2">patients that no you&#39;re gonna need a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.090" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">stop drinking coca-cola and stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:05.830" style="s2">this you&#39;re gonna need to walk eight</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.050" style="s2">miles a day you&#39;re gonna need to like</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.700" end="00:46:15.340" style="s2">you have like the list of holistic</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:17.410" style="s2">realities that need to go into having</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.340" end="00:46:19.750" style="s2">such a physical transformation as is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.410" end="00:46:24.430" style="s2">necessary so often here in our modern</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.750" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">world it&#39;s like we I think in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.430" end="00:46:30.460" style="s2">stoicism really lends itself to being</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:34.119" style="s2">able to like pull off your mask be real</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.460" end="00:46:36.790" style="s2">with what is happening in you so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.119" end="00:46:39.010" style="s2">you can even begin to comprehend the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.790" end="00:46:42.550" style="s2">truthfulness that could come down the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.010" end="00:46:44.650" style="s2">hill from someone above you in some kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.550" end="00:46:48.030" style="s2">of any kind of hierarchy really because</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.650" end="00:46:51.850" style="s2">I feel like we have lost our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.030" end="00:46:53.350" style="s2">to hear from authority that they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.850" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">made a mistake that they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.350" end="00:46:58.869" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but they&#39;re not sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:47:03.100" style="s2">what to do yes we&#39;re like allergic to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.869" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">the uncertainty Peter yeah like I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.100" end="00:47:10.180" style="s2">I really liked what you said is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.369" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">metaphor you use it with the map someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.180" end="00:47:13.330" style="s2">comes with direction that is perfect as</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:14.500" style="s2">you know the map territory thing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.330" end="00:47:16.210" style="s2">your hundred-percent right is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.500" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">someone can be really truthful but there</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.210" end="00:47:20.700" style="s2">it got it wrong right and that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:24.070" style="s2">kind of need everyone to be truthful</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.700" end="00:47:26.170" style="s2">because that is when the truth will come</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.070" end="00:47:28.180" style="s2">out the truth will be some s in a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.170" end="00:47:29.830" style="s2">right if everyone starts opening up</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.180" end="00:47:31.180" style="s2">their eyes and just kind of risks being</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.830" end="00:47:32.740" style="s2">truthful with the blind men and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.180" end="00:47:33.910" style="s2">elephant then that I start opening up</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.740" end="00:47:35.590" style="s2">and we can say you the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.910" end="00:47:38.050" style="s2">collectively but we have to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.590" end="00:47:40.630" style="s2">other truthfully and for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.050" end="00:47:44.740" style="s2">Trump is coming to mind because there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.630" end="00:47:46.450" style="s2">an odd authentic see he&#39;s an oddly</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.740" end="00:47:48.670" style="s2">authentic in a way yeah because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.450" end="00:47:50.109" style="s2">like he&#39;s the king of bullshit but he</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.670" end="00:47:51.490" style="s2">bullshit&#39;s in such a way where it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.109" end="00:47:53.710" style="s2">of like he winks at you at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.490" end="00:47:55.690" style="s2">like yeah you know I&#39;m bullshitting and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.710" end="00:47:57.609" style="s2">I know you know right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.690" end="00:48:00.970" style="s2">like his feeling you feel him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.609" end="00:48:02.980" style="s2">really authentic there and so I do</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.970" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">think he got elected for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.980" end="00:48:06.369" style="s2">because I think people felt that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:10.660" style="s2">authenticity and I think that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.369" end="00:48:13.960" style="s2">good step towards leaders who are as</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.660" end="00:48:15.369" style="s2">authentic as that but truthful at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.960" end="00:48:17.830" style="s2">same time so I think there&#39;s a hunger</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.369" end="00:48:20.619" style="s2">here and I think Trump is just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.830" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">maybe a step towards that direction to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.619" end="00:48:26.349" style="s2">be nationally charitable that brings up</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:28.930" style="s2">a couple things for me that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.349" end="00:48:33.160" style="s2">thinking about lately and Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.930" end="00:48:37.000" style="s2">again brought up this amazing point that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.160" end="00:48:40.060" style="s2">he years ago wrote this article I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.000" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">he refers to it as K fab and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.060" end="00:48:46.840" style="s2">idea that like in professional wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:48.730" style="s2">like in professional wrestling the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.840" end="00:48:49.450" style="s2">outcomes are known before the match</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.730" end="00:48:52.060" style="s2">starts</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.450" end="00:48:55.000" style="s2">but like the death rate of the wrestlers</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.060" end="00:48:57.220" style="s2">is like very real like these guys are</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.000" end="00:48:59.080" style="s2">like getting broken collar bones and</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.220" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">scapula&#39;s at every match and like all</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.080" end="00:49:03.700" style="s2">these like there is a real element to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.119" end="00:49:11.010" style="s2">but in general the entire thing though</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.700" end="00:49:16.300" style="s2">is a fabrication right and we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.010" end="00:49:21.190" style="s2">hopefully fingers crossed we are moments</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.300" end="00:49:26.260" style="s2">away from our political structures being</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.190" end="00:49:28.270" style="s2">seen for what they are where the there</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.260" end="00:49:31.869" style="s2">are real elements to it but the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.270" end="00:49:36.720" style="s2">framework itself the rivalry the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.869" end="00:49:36.720" style="s2">outcomes are for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.020" end="00:49:43.150" style="s2">fabricated right and he talks about I</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:45.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know have you ever seen the clip</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.150" end="00:49:47.109" style="s2">but Donald Trump has literally been</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.220" end="00:49:49.000" style="s2">involved in professional wrestling like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.109" end="00:49:51.609" style="s2">yeah oh yeah I saw yeah right he had</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.000" end="00:49:57.849" style="s2">this match with Vince McMahon who is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.609" end="00:50:00.460" style="s2">founder of the WWE and Weinstein like</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.849" end="00:50:03.930" style="s2">talks about how powerful Donald Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.460" end="00:50:07.270" style="s2">because he Intuit&#39;s he into its</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.930" end="00:50:09.510" style="s2">professional wrestling and he into its</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.270" end="00:50:09.510" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.570" end="00:50:18.760" style="s2">this underlying thing that is that goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.339" end="00:50:20.950" style="s2">back to like Vince McMahon basically in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.760" end="00:50:23.770" style="s2">the history of the WWE they basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.950" end="00:50:26.980" style="s2">got pulled into Congress because they</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.770" end="00:50:31.030" style="s2">were about to face this huge spike in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.980" end="00:50:33.540" style="s2">taxes because they were being they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.030" end="00:50:33.540" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.880" end="00:50:39.950" style="s2">like they were falling into the category</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.680" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">of sports and sports has a whole nother</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.950" end="00:50:45.940" style="s2">tax bracket that they have to pay into</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:47.690" style="s2">and Vince McMahon goes in to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.940" end="00:50:49.579" style="s2">congressional hearing and he basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.690" end="00:50:52.269" style="s2">pulls the mask off the whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.579" end="00:50:55.009" style="s2">he says that the entire thing is made up</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.269" end="00:50:59.450" style="s2">which at the time it would like this was</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.009" end="00:51:01.490" style="s2">like a trade secret and he went in there</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.450" end="00:51:03.829" style="s2">and said this entire thing is made up</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.490" end="00:51:05.569" style="s2">we are not sports you cannot tax us like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.829" end="00:51:06.799" style="s2">this and what happened to professional</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.569" end="00:51:08.809" style="s2">wrestling did the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.799" end="00:51:11.089" style="s2">disintegrate no it didn&#39;t fucking</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.809" end="00:51:14.440" style="s2">disintegrate at all it like if if</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.089" end="00:51:17.539" style="s2">nothing else it got more popular and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.440" end="00:51:19.609" style="s2">this for me is if something is something</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.539" end="00:51:20.589" style="s2">that I&#39;m not sure actually how to feel</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.609" end="00:51:22.940" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.589" end="00:51:26.630" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.940" end="00:51:28.819" style="s2">intuited for a long time that people in</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.630" end="00:51:31.640" style="s2">general kind of know that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.819" end="00:51:35.170" style="s2">thing is made up and that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.640" end="00:51:38.150" style="s2">doing on the internet seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.170" end="00:51:41.269" style="s2">something that we are like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.150" end="00:51:47.329" style="s2">totally different things and no matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.269" end="00:51:49.700" style="s2">how concretely we dispel some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.329" end="00:51:52.809" style="s2">myths that are in the the gated</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.700" end="00:51:57.499" style="s2">institutional narrative no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.809" end="00:51:59.269" style="s2">like victorious we are in dispelling</p>
