<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">regulars of the stoa uh we talk about or</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:09.200" style="s2">at least i talk about something called</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">the metagame we used to have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">metagame mastermind here</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">and uh i remember i was doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">presentation for daniel kazanjian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">medimine mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">group and i just came up with the term</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">uh definition on the spot for for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">not on the spot but beforehand uh for</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">the metagame and i defined it as playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">the metagame helps us discover</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">the right relationship with the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">of games we are currently playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">so the idea there there&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">ecology of games and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">see it and decide which one to play and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">i find it quite compatible with this</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">game model because um jamie and jimmy</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">will talk about there&#39;s like four</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">ontological game categories uh the short</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">game the mid game the long game the deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">uh and um they all have kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">a different uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">way to go about playing them well so</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">that being said uh it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">standard still a format</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">jamie and eric are going to like uh chat</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">about it i imagine they might pull me</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">into that conversation too</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll do the q a so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">any questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">um just throw in the chat i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">call you i&#39;ll meet yourself if you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">so that being said i will allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">eric and jamie to mute themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">tag whoever wants to be taped in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">okay we on great thank you peter</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">hello everybody eric</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">um yeah today since we&#39;re short on time</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">i think this is going to be so much fun</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">um what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">to produce uh talk about this funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">little conceptual model for game</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">dynamics which today we&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">present as</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">kind of a lens and kind of a game so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">can pick up on the metagame frame easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">and you guys probably already have lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">of lenses to look at what&#39;s going on so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">this is just another one</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">the nature of what i want to do today is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">kind of explain it as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">possible because it&#39;s nice and simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll put it on and kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">at the nature of what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">look at people</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">look at this kind of accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s got everybody a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">jumpy</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">um and seeing if this lens is helpful</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">does that make sense um</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">again so if you take it in from the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">of again it&#39;s just a lens right</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">and we all start from this common</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">question of what the is going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">and what should i do and how should i do</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">it and where to begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">and i think that there&#39;s this common</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">overwhelm and four game takes that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">says okay let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">in any number of places but let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">by saying that is the metagame</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s a metagame that&#39;s characterized</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">by four games happening simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">and the nature of what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">do is not to win them</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">but to balance them juggle them get into</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">flow with them</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">now that&#39;s just a conceit that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">by putting on the lens and playing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">so we&#39;re not trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">philosophical statement about that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">but if we&#39;re going to address this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">of accelerating complexity coming at us</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">as a mystery boom what metaphor are we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">going to put on that in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">we can interact with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">um in a pleasant way in a productive way</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s what four game</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">is about and the first kind of idea is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">well part of the nature of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">is just too much is too much</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s just too much coming at you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">and of course you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">paralyzed in the same way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">juggle 15 balls</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite amount of balls so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">the game can&#39;t be who can juggle more</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">balls</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">um so four games looked at these four</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">different games that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">and give them names for them that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">already probably a little familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">first one is that everyone knows is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">their long game</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">your long game this is your narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">the narrative part of your life</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">you tell it in story form it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">just your plan of what you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s more like your life script and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">have it with you right now and i could</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">sit and we could talk to any one of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">and we could pull it out of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">people like peter who have put it online</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">we all kind of know a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">about what his long game is right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re here because of his long game</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">in the air you&#39;re breathing and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">got a whole mid-game situation around</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">head into</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">that&#39;s your environment that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">systems that&#39;s your actual gadgets</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">and those work together with your short</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">game and your long game</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">again this isn&#39;t anything new this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">a cleaner way of labeling what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">already know to be true</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">which makes it less teaching but more</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">showing</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">and then playing and then the last game</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">is your deep game which is uh more of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">metaphorical game</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">and this is an interesting one because</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">the deep game goes all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">edge of where we would all go if we had</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">hours to talk this out</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">which is mystery we&#39;d end up overlooking</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">at this void of mystery and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">with a cosmic shrug of i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">and if i did i couldn&#39;t put it into</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">words but when we communicate it we back</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">down there to some kind of metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">and i call that your deep game i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">river i don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">parade i don&#39;t and it can be on a macro</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">in terms of your ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">or it could be a micro in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">project the stowa is a digital campfire</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">that metaphor frames this um so within</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">deep so when you&#39;re staring at mystery</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">in a four game lens</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">you recognize the name of the game is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">mystery there&#39;s no escaping that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">where all the fun is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">the next layer so that&#39;s the meta meta</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">game if you want the meta meta games</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">mystery</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">the metagame next is what metaphor are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">you going to put around that mystery</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:02.959" style="s2">that gives you a sense of identity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">purpose and connection and resonance</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">that matches everything else and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">the nature of playing those four games</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">is getting those into alignment or flow</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">and you may or may not have ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">those terms but you&#39;ll probably have</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">been in that state</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">where your short game your mid game your</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">long game and your deep game are all</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">click it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">and aligned and you get this emergent</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">point and it feels like peter you&#39;ve had</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">suddenly complicated nuanced things can</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">get done</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">swiftly by a diverse group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">that seems to me to be the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">what who gives a why is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">important well i think it&#39;s why is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">important because a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">are facing accelerating complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">the nature of what they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">is a vocabulary of all vocabularies or a</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">to sim to not reduce it but to refine it</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">peter but also by this</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">broader long game that you&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">to set out which is f</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">which is what everyone&#39;s trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">their finger on and having listened to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">you it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">we could have some fun exploring well</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">maybe the nature of the long game is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">stealing the culture like oh okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">a narrative long game you could start to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">build with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not maybe it&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">thing but the the next step it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">me when you have this whole pack of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">uh well-intentioned hole thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">is they need a common vocabulary so they</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">can go from kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">tower of babylon situation to a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">coherent in action where everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">getting in their own four-game</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">generative flow</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to take your four games</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">and put them in mine i&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">so yours are in harmony with who you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">and what you want to do and how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">conceive it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">idiosyncratic thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s more of a thing of giving the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">content and then letting people play as</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">play as they wish that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">yeah totally um</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">i i can&#39;t go yeah okay yeah like uh</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">all right i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">i think there&#39;s one level uh worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">exploring here</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">jamie that was awesome thank you again</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">good to see everyone at the store this</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">um i have a few a few comments to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">on what jamie said</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">um one of the things i&#39;ve heard guy sing</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">stock and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">the circling crew talk about a lot is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">way of being you just have this essence</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">one of the best examples probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">someone like alan watts terence mckenna</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">people with this character persona</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">personality to them</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">and one of the things that i love about</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">four game and when i first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">started talking to jamie about this was</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">your way of being is the sum total</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:08.320" style="s2">of your four games right the way you act</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">the things you use</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.320" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">the you&#39;re trying to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">world like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">and what it allows for is like well you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">can actually tweak all these dials</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">if you want to be a different way if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">want to be a different person tweak some</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">of the dials that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">right tweak the metaphor that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">following um</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">i think when people get into like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">spiritual world a lot their deep game</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">narrative actually changes fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">and you can also see how it shifts down</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">and shifts up</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">if you change the metaphor of how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">view reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">your short game your feelings your</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">thoughts will change as a result it</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">cascades down but it also cascades up</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">you know you can see clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">with jordan peterson right</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">right in the mid game right if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">actually wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">change any of them you can start</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">anywhere that&#39;s a line that jamie has</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">freaking awesome as well right pick a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">game start anywhere if you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">a change you can actually just focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">these i think another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">worth addressing here is if any of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">are misaligned</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">like if your work doesn&#39;t actually match</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">what you state your role is or what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">state like the metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">you&#39;ll feel that friction and it comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">in like anxiety depression confusion</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">and so there is just a sense of yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">you can get everything in line</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">make it all cohesive and coherent you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">actually thrive</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">a lot more from it and again just the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">simple package that jamie has here is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">what extremely what appealed to me just</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">extremely about this whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">what jamie and i really clicked on in</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">one of our first conversations was oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just an individual thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">like you can take this and you can put</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">it for schools of thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">like what&#39;s the four game of zen right</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">what&#39;s the four game of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">what&#39;s the four game of yoga what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">four game of kovid</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">right jamie and i were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">that a little bit right it messed up</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">everyone&#39;s mid game started trickling</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">down into their short game</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">probably changed what you thought you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">could do with your long game maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">you thought it was like the wrath of god</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">was affecting the deep game</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">but so you can do events you can do</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">people you can do everything just</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">through this lens</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">and you know this this group is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:22.959" style="s2">of hosting a lot of different ideas a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">lot of different people</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.959" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">a lot of different concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">we can get into a mess of talking past</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">i&#39;m reminiscing on the sam harris jordan</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">where they were all actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">talk about the same thing but talking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">different levels of it and it just</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">became this</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">this show basically if you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">actually have this shared language where</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">mid game level what&#39;s going on here deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">game level what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">even people with highly polarized or</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">highly opposite or highly opposing views</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">can actually come together</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">for some semblance of a sane reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">and i think the i think the last point</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">on this is you know this zooms up from</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">individual to a company to a community</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">but to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">culture as well you know you look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">east versus west we talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">things trickle down</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">well if you have a story that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">kind of ghost in the shell</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">you know pulled here from the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">you know put here to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">suffer nature well that affects how</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">everything in your life would show up</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">but if you take you know there&#39;s a this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">kind of eastern culture like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">emerging from nature we&#39;re part of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">you see that reflect down into culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">into even the way they write</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">right their language is highly picture</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">based right it&#39;s more metaphorical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">not as literal as the kind of western</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">uh anglicized alphabet</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">like there&#39;s just a huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">um ramification</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">long long tail effect to just how you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">set up these games how cultures set up</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">these games how companies set them up</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s a there&#39;s always been a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">sense of how do we get like break</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">breakthrough velocity with the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">that&#39;s going on here because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">absolutely critical it&#39;s so absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">essential but so many of us are either</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">trapped in smaller communities have</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">trouble getting it out have trouble</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:17.240" style="s2">making people care</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">and jamie&#39;s package of just this</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.240" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">relentlessly</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">simple relentlessly concise package</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">actually highly aesthetic the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">thing can be boiled down to those two</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">pictures that i shared earlier like</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">this is the stuff that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">virally spread and that&#39;s that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">what appeals to me so much about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">model is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">encapsulates almost everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">we lost your audio there for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">there oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">uh i think all i was saying was you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">one of the advantages i think to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">is that the whole thing can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">summed up in those two pictures that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">right just the the the four game</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">breakdown and how they&#39;re all nested</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">within each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">and if you can just ship that off to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">people be like here</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">start here let&#39;s do this you actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">just bring together</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">everyone and get that kind of critical</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">mass the viral outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">of that&#39;s extremely useful to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">so i think i think that&#39;s my little</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">mellow riff on all that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">cool this was my internet that was uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">popping in and out so</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">i started with that uh jamie do you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">to add anything or should we pivot to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">the the q</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">a portion i think no we can we can pivot</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">to uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">you know matching up to with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">doing because now here we are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">culture wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">i think if you put the lenses on and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna say okay the metagame is</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">how do we play our four games well our</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">collective problem is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">how do we get our four game</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">together before it&#39;s too late</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">i mean language it as you wish you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">but i think part of that pro part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">that question which we can all look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">then i can we all</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">share looking at it is um whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">as eric says we&#39;re going to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.640" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">able to put it and articulate it in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">simple clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">enough direct enough way that we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">engage a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">and so i think simplicity and aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">are going to have to be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">um to get to the next piece and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">why i think you&#39;re this whole group and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing peter is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the group of people who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">naturally going to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">and do it i think so yeah no i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">share it and get talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">whatever&#39;s on everybody&#39;s mind and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">think we&#39;ll find if you take what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">your mind and look through a four game</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">or institution that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">basically create something that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">been created before and a dead player</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">can only be effective</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">uh following a script um</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">and so like and this is the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">about authenticity which i think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">etymology of that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">to um be the author of one&#39;s own life uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">so you&#39;re like authoring your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">your own script</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">so do you have any thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">about this sort of like self-authoring</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">process with each games and i find it</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">really useful too kind of like honing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">on okay this is a mid game that i gotta</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">write i&#39;m following a like a dead script</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">here or following a dead script a long</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">grain</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">etc uh yeah i would say um</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">all the the life scripting stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">a great in four game speech that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">real long gaming skill</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">absolutely that so and that&#39;s turning</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">into a story that kind of pulls you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">towards it and feels authentic</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">so i would say that that&#39;s now you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">tell a story about</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">the changes in your mid game or you can</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">well you didn&#39;t always have this mid</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">game you didn&#39;t always have this level</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">you know and put it together um but so</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">you could when i think of life for um</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.919" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">role you want to be the mid game you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">like to have the activities you like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">do the feelings you&#39;d like to feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">you won&#39;t hit it of course but that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">specificity</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">um help helps give give pull and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">more aligned it is and the more you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">see it</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">you know that&#39;s when everybody&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">vision and oh my god i got drawn to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">those are four games that are really</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">personally aligned</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">and so self-authoring for me is a great</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">long game</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">so you know jordan peters says</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">self-authoring good long game advice</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">good mid-game advice a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">starting anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">yeah i have one uh i&#39;ve won one comment</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">to add on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">which is uh you know it&#39;s nice it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">to have an idea that the work you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">doing is actually effective</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">or that it&#39;s actually going to work and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">you&#39;re not just kind of spraying and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">praying a bunch of random</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">and again you know i spoke if if any one</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">of these things is lacking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">actually going to feel it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">in whatever way that is if it&#39;s short</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">mid it&#39;s probably just a physical like</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">discomfort anxiety thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">but if it&#39;s on the upper levels like</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">you&#39;re talking existential dread</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">like complete nihilism stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">so if you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">you can almost use it to diagnose where</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">right if you feel like life is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">completely pointless</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">and yet you&#39;re filling it with the short</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">mid game stuff cars money</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">you know fancy stuff uh it&#39;s never going</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">to fix it because you&#39;re not addressing</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">it in the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">realm you actually have to get your</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">story and why you&#39;re here in check</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">which has absolutely nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">the material world right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">intangible</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">right it actually gets less tangible as</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">you go up and so it&#39;s like look</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">if you actually do want to self author a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">figure out what you&#39;re actually lacking</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">and then that actually gives you a sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">of what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">to fix those things and address them and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">bring them into line</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re a whole bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">you know running the hamster wheel of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">like well let me just</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">get the the smart watch optimize myself</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">suddenly fix the grand narrative of why</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like no man that&#39;s not how that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">works so actually it can be used to kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">of hone your</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">your focus and what you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">working on because yeah you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">break them all down where am i now</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">where do i want to be how do i want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">you know then you have a then you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">that path and it&#39;s just a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">showing up and doing it</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">rather than always feeling like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">know what i need to do next</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">it actually gives you some like answers</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">to that some steps</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">uh like in an inverse of that too um</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">tim ferriss came to mind like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">the knowing the right game domain</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">uh like i think he said something once</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">where it&#39;s like let&#39;s say if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">um are feeling bad maybe because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a good night&#39;s sleep or</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">and then you&#39;re trying to like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">have an existential crisis and try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">solve the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">life&#39;s mysteries meanwhile you just need</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">to eat right or go to bed at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">and focus on that kind of nickname or</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">short game</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:33.600" style="s2">yeah i would say ferris is is a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.919" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">example of a whole thinker</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.600" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">he&#39;ll point out a problem that presents</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">over here but maybe there&#39;s a solution</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">over here um but also a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">since he&#39;s not there&#39;s not a common word</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">for it we don&#39;t quite know</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">when he&#39;s jumping to a deep game thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">to a short game thing to a mid game</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">so it helps i think regular people kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">of digest</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">these four game proficient people</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">i can understand what they&#39;re saying i</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">can understand jordan peterson i can</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">found allows you to learn a lot quicker</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">from a lot more people</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">well actually there&#39;s a the ferris</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">is actually fantastic because it shows</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">the evolution of the games</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">over time because if you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">following like right now what he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:25.039" style="s2">going through in the past few years like</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">he&#39;s doing the the psychedelic medicine</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.039" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">push but actually like this week you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">know he released a big thing about</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">childhood trauma</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">you know addressing like deep inner</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">emotional wounds and so he progressed</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">again trying to fill like the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">higher level stuff with the success fame</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">money stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t work at all started doing some</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">kind of narrative inner emotional work</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">got more results and is actually like</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">again he&#39;s aligning it and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">a lot of results from it so i think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">a fantastic example of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">yeah you just gotta put your effort in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">the right places and it&#39;ll actually come</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">through for you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">yeah and a good example of starting</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">anywhere and getting everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">yeah yeah very cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">um rain you had a few questions if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">can choose one</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">yeah thanks thanks for being here eric</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">and jamie</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">um i had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">this you mentioned a couple times the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">benefit of a shared</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">language a shared framework um</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">which um seems you know true</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">a priori that that we need to have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">mutual understanding in mutual terms</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">um in terms of the culture cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">intellectual landscape</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">finding our way how i see it out of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">post-modern morass</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">where we can actually make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">things again and and say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">some things are true or at least more</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:57.120" style="s2">true than others</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">um is a big task without falling back</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">into modernist</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">paradigms um that say this is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.240" style="s2">this is the one way to talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">so um to make it more personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">i&#39;m sort of like unins uninspired</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">um so to speak from um</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">you know another model or another</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">framework so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">how would you propose to engage</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">meta-modern thinkers who</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">really don&#39;t care what the le the tools</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">the words of the framework are as long</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">something that they can fluidly step</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">in order to make sense in that moment in</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">that context</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.840" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">yeah i would say that&#39;s just exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">what it&#39;s for you have a long game</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">call it whatever you want you have a mid</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:44.480" style="s2">game you have a short game</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">you don&#39;t like the language or the frame</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.480" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">or whatever but the nature of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">progressing from whatever state</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">of affairs you are now to a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">richer</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">one way or another one model or another</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:55.799" style="s2">one yoga or another</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be taking this</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.799" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">multi-dimensional whatever you call</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:01.840" style="s2">situation you find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">and being able to put it in your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.840" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">mind in such a way that you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">feel like you&#39;ve got some agency on it</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">and take things from a mental realm and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">put them into a mid-game realm</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s really agnostic about forcing</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">the language down everyone who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">really fussy about it&#39;s a lens call it</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">what you want pick your own metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">this is just kind of getting started to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">make the point of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">whatever you want to call those</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">dimensions you can&#39;t not have them</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">and we can get more granular we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">make more dimensions we could forget all</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">the forms and have no dimensions at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">but there&#39;s some virtue if you get it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">just a few</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">you can have a high leverage without</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">being too overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">which i found has allowed you to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">complex things done over time</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">with a lot of people who do have</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">different models like i don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">agree on a lot of things if we have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">same long-term goal</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">right if we have the same short game</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">attitude what&#39;s going on in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">and mind is different we&#39;ll get along</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">just fine</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">so it allows you to to not have to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">and get those bases covered any which</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">way that works with people</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">one of my early jobs as a kid is i was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">trainer</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">and people want to come and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">talk about something instead of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">and it helps fix that it&#39;s like instead</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">of getting hung up on the lingo</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">it&#39;s direct pointing is a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">so i find the meta modern people are the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">because they&#39;ve gone and all they</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve done a lot of research down a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">lot of different dimensions so</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a lot of models and they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">connect a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">what they find when they look through</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">four games is they start to put things</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh i noticed the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">similarities between the long games of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">all this huxley and alan watts or the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">mid game between</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">king arthur and alexander or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">i think you guys have a lot of fuel for</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way of looking and we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">all put it on and look at it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">and and react to it differently but if</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">the nature of someone&#39;s life or a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">company or a culture is they&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">when you put on the lens you&#39;ll find one</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">of their four games is jacked up their</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">long game doesn&#39;t make sense their mid</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">game is counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">their behaviors are self-destructive or</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">is self-defeating and no amount of</p>

<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">circle if you look to a town or a nation</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">or or globally so</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s not this not not in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">silo so what do you are you thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">yeah i find a lot of of the relation bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">of the family comes into that long game</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">piece like what roles are you know i</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">distinguish role from identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">right your role as a father your role is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">a business a role as a teacher a role as</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">a steward</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">those are the roles you kind of commit</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">to from a long game point of view</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">so in terms of social interaction a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to play our roles well</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">um and so a lot of that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">until you get to really close personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">is we&#39;re relating role to role</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know all the intimate</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">pieces about you you know in business</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">and this group i think starts to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">some identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">because not only do we share a goal some</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">version of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">of a cleaner greener future everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">trying to figure out what their roles</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">in that longer plan and that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">think a lot of community you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">have a long game</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">because before we know our roles and how</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">we&#39;re going to relate what are we trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">and how are we trying to do it what do</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">we think is going on and what what are</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">we going to use to get there</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">so i think i find that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">social relations</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">once there&#39;s trying to be a purpose or</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">something to be done um the long game</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">roles</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">start to bring out the requirements of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">yeah i like that any follow-up michael</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.840" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m thinking like when suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">there if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">conflict between the roles uh some</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:35.840" style="s2">your children want this but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">do an extra project at work at the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">a family family member wants this of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">so how do you handle like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">the divergence of dissociation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a great case that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">multi-dimensional problem</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a perfect example and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where the agency is</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">and then i i i thou relating is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">um connecting with someone on a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">level like recognizing the the god</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">within each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">uh and a lot of these intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">practices that we practice here at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">stoa</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">kind of gesture towards i thou way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">relating so how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">like if you want to say if those are two</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">different types of games that i it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">constellation of games in the i thou</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">constellation of games how would that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">fit in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">four game model you know um</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">yeah interesting you could do well if</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">you think i</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">it versus you know if you go to deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">game then you can say lots of ways we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">going to look at dp game there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">i and it self and other and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">alien i&#39;m going to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">dualistic deep game that sets you up and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">really as opposed to a holistic deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">gain</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">it says hey me and the other and my</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">metaphor we&#39;re really the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">so those i see those as kind of riding</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">on two different</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">deep games of what&#39;s what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">when you recognize that hey we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">of the same thing i&#39;m not here to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">exploit you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got four games i&#39;m here to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">empower you and light you up so you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">go do</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">what you want to do i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">put ideas in your head i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">give you a language so you can go write</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">your own poetry</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">that that that difference um and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">where i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">in the deep game the more holistic point</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">of view</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">it is and it doesn&#39;t matter necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">the form but just the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">of gestalt the back goes with the front</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">the front goes all of a piece it can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s not alienating to each other um</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">i think that drills down to a short game</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">attitude</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">that you have with other people which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">like hey hooray i</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">won&#39;t get your four games stronger what</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">else what else what&#39;s more satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">than that as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying that instrumentalized</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">where i&#39;ve got some alienating deep game</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">that makes me go through life</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">trying to get people you know to execute</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">steps for me and so that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">might have a deep game problem but</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even know it but it would</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">present and you&#39;re this very exploitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">so a lot of people when they change or</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">they have a psychedelic experience or</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">some reason up in their deep game they</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">get that little holistic blip</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">and they realize the left hand isn&#39;t out</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">to get the right hand they&#39;re of a piece</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">then i think that kind of instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">way of looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">goes away you become less looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">world like a gold mine and more looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">like the world like a garden</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">and therefore your role changes in what</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">so if that makes sense would that be</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">like the flip between the finite game</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">versus infinite game and use carson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">yes pro yes yeah you could have finite</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">games within the infinite game but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">take them sincerely not too seriously</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the whole game metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">again if the framing of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">one of the virtues of the game is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">metaphor whoever uses it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">is by the time it drills down to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">short game it helps you have confidence</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">and a playful feeling</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">which is what you need to get into flow</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">so if i have divine judgment as my deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">game it&#39;s hard to get playful divine</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:11.440" style="s2">flow vibe</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">going in my short game so that&#39;s why a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">lot of these things where you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">to elicit</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">confidence they want to try to make it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">some type of game</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">because that&#39;s we can engage with games</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">again with sincerity without too much</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it gives it pull</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">and you want to do it for its own right</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">and as long as it&#39;s a generative game</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s what if the four game</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">elements are just right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">generative game</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">you&#39;re playing a generative game peter</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve the stow is a generative piece of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">mid-game</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">the more you do it the better you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got your things aligned</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of thing we&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">whereas if your law if your deep game</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">was some kind of alienating thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">all this was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">exploitive money grab that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">different four games that you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t be generative</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">from my point of view does that make</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">yeah i got a little i got a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">comment on that as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">which actually ties into i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">going to tie into michael&#39;s earlier</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">question as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">there&#39;s been some semblance of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">conversation where we&#39;re actually coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:14.320" style="s2">uh with answers already like oh let me</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">look at zen through this and actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.320" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">just inject into it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">i think it can also be really useful to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">start pulling things out and actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">getting the initial questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">rather than the answers for them like uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">with with michael&#39;s thing about family</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">and like choosing between family and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">if i actually look at my life through</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">this and what and where the tension is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">arising</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">a question comes up where it&#39;s like am i</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">actually okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">putting my work before my family and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">that could spawn</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">very very beneficial things for you and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">i think to peter&#39;s question as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">are we actually okay with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">smartest</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">people our countries produce earning the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">most amount of money to contribute to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">global</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">socioeconomic system that treats the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">world as i it</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">like is that actually are we comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">continuing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:05.359" style="s2">and that question can come from the lens</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually a starting point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.359" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not the end insertion it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">okay now i&#39;m seeing where the friction</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">why my stomach feels weird when the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">smartest ass people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">sell me stuff on facebook and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">where do i go with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">what does realigning that look like and</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">so yeah i think this actually ties into</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">jamie&#39;s point it can be generative</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.400" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">in that way of actually adding more or</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">giving us places to start</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">rather than just coming from this as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:37.119" style="s2">kind of post-hoc analysis</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">so the long game of stealing the culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">is back at the store officially after</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">after hearing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">i stopped using that phrase but i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">back um</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">do you have anything to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">jamie before i go to the next question</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:54.650" style="s2">nope that was good okay um</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:57.829" style="s2">alex you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.650" end="00:40:57.829" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">thank you peter so um i&#39;m trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">if i can phrase this question</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">the very language of game is something</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">do with others in society so it has a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">lot to do with external validation</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">it says my connection is unstable so i</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">hope i&#39;m not too choppy here</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">so it seems to me it&#39;s a very individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">lens</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">to look at society and who you are and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">how you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">interface with society it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">what neo and morpheus do</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">when they plug into the matrix you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">they&#39;re in the matrix and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.680" style="s2">playing a game</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">and then they come out of the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.680" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">presumably when you come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">matrix</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">you&#39;re that metaphysical self self your</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">that true identity and you even have it</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">here who is that true self who is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">you who is that metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s aware</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">um that you have a body on earth and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">presumably</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">there there&#39;s no game that&#39;s your true</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">so for me it&#39;s it&#39;s contradictory to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">that there&#39;s a metaphysical game</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">because that&#39;s external validation like</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll get laid by saying i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">like some great guru</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">right and i&#39;m getting this external</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">validation because i have this deep game</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">right but that&#39;s not why one should have</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:18.640" style="s2">a deep game</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">one should have a deep game not for any</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">external validation but because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">your true self</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">so i&#39;m i&#39;m finding a contradiction in</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">terms there</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">sure yeah let me help it that the real</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">thing we&#39;re saying is mystery the only</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">thing we&#39;re asserting the whole game is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">played on mystery which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">which isn&#39;t even asserting anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">about a true self i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">but the truest thing i know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a cosmic shrug</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">now if i want to handle it i can put any</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">kind of frame on it i want if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">want to put game i could put dance i</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">could put melody i could put garden</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">we&#39;re already it&#39;s already a conceit to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">put the frame on it so i&#39;m not mistaking</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.400" style="s2">but to get a sense of identity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">going to have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">to the metaphor because you can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">language on</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">mystery so if it&#39;s a way if if it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">of like an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">well then my identity is maybe kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">like a wave on the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">now that&#39;s not to say that is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just what it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s where my short game is going</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">to resonate oh if that&#39;s what i really</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">think if i really look in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">mystery and i say</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:24.880" style="s2">god i don&#39;t know but it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.880" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">well then that&#39;s deep game metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">the one i&#39;m operating with</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">and my identity is going to drill down</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">is that going to be the final truth</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">no you couldn&#39;t be in words anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not trying to make that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">i&#39;m aware of that mistake you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not trying to assert that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">that&#39;s why starting at mystery i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">is the most honest place</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">then we can say great let&#39;s play with</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">language and see what we can come up</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">with as we all stare at this mystery</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">that makes sense but that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">question are specifically</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">trying to avoid that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a great uh thank you um i find</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">it so interesting because yesterday we</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">had the session on</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">nihilism nihilism i don&#39;t even know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">to say the word</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">and this seems to be the opposite this</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">is the anti-nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">there&#39;s actually meaning in what we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">well because</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">yeah well because with wonder it in</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">mystery and i don&#39;t use unknowing or</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">anything i use mystery</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">because the flip side of mystery is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">curiosity and wonder and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">that you can self-validate even if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">you can say man that&#39;s true and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">everybody has regardless of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">culture or whatever they frame they put</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">and if i find if we can start in good</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">faith there</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">that saves a lot of trouble downstream</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.119" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">i think there&#39;s i think there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">other thing which is almost getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">to semantics but uh i i agree with how</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">you were describing the game</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">at some level but the other the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">way i would look at game is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">or at least play because you play games</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">of you know something you do for its own</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">sake</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s d it&#39;s done because it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">just beautiful in and of itself you</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">actually don&#39;t do it you don&#39;t give it</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">damn about anyone else i&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">because it gives me deep satisfaction</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:19.040" style="s2">i think there is a deep game lens where</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.040" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">what is going on here if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">playful</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">like if it wasn&#39;t going to be playful i</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do this this seems like a lot</p>

<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">orchestrating this like</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">because the thing in itself was</p>

<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">it probably just wouldn&#39;t be done and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">in that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:41.119" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a another framing of at</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">least the game</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">the game semantics or the game wording</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s like yo it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a thing in itself you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">actually have to play any of these games</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.599" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">you could just sit and kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">nothing be an npc you know have</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">you know just go along but they are fun</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">games to play should you choose to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">actually like</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">show up at the table and start playing</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">them yeah and the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">the frame of game forces you to think of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">you know so we&#39;re going to be playing</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">here that&#39;s not like working</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">um exactly or culture war or cultural</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">war or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">some frame that&#39;s you can&#39;t get out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">it it&#39;s there&#39;s no scenario although</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">you&#39;re locked in from the metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be tribes fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">killing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no plan in that and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">trying to get into generative flow which</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">requires a sense of kind of creative</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">wonder and play</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">and authenticity you&#39;ve snipped it off</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">before you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">started and then you layer into that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">mid game that&#39;s not conducive and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">all of that so these it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">non-obvious</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know not obvious significance of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.119" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">the of the deep game</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">and the play bit because it&#39;s a short</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">hop from play to creative</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a short hop from it&#39;s a mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">universe so let&#39;s build this on creative</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to get you into</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">generative flow so you can be in</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s coming out of you nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">telling you it&#39;s just that emergent</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:02.840" style="s2">in the moment we&#39;re trying to spark</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">spark that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.840" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.640" style="s2">and another thing uh came to mind with</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">the framing and this may be a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.640" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">to eric um</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">so like we need to worry at a previous</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">session she had uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">she said like the problem with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">these sense making spaces is there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">much epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">fat that was a term she used and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:22.839" style="s2">teased her i&#39;m like the term epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">fat is kind of epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.839" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">benefit you know like people in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">space and then i&#39;m sure eric we would</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">like geek out and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">masturbate about all these mental models</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">and these kind of these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">um but like from my dale carnegie</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">background i&#39;m a dale carnegie trainer</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the great thing about dale carnegie</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">he just simplified things and just spoke</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">in very common language</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">and to double click on rain&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">before um</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of cool having kind of a slew</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">of mental models they all might be</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">pointing like the fingers at the moon</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">but picking one that really resonates</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">the audience you&#39;re gonna speak to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">um so i&#39;m curious if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">yeah the so among among my friend groups</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">here i&#39;m probably the one just most</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:09.280" style="s2">personally interested in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:11.280" style="s2">kind of sense making stove space and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.280" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">the amount of times i&#39;ve sent a daniel</p>

<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">absolutely tragic because i&#39;m a huge fan</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">of everything going on in this space and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">i was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">this is critical like let&#39;s do this all</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">all hands on deck</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">and it is just falling like it is just</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">falling right at the face we never</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">tragic because at least at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">the at least at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">everyone in the world is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">to be playing some game you know this is</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">and there are a lot of people who have</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">capacity to do some of this and so there</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">is this just</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">what is the most relentlessly</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">it too it might actually help</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think we can underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">just how important that stuff is and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">you know again it&#39;s what made me land</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">with jamie so strongly was like</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">this feels maybe if it&#39;s not the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">answer like a damn good step in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">right direction because this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.839" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">almost more aesthetic than it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">and that was like something feels right</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">you know it helps put it helps at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">me anyway come from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">you can be like wow check out the long</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">you know what&#39;s the thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">bandits in the street recognize each</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">other immediately</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">yeah everybody that&#39;s trying to improve</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">things from a multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">insight it seems like put a circle</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">around all of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">um they have a lot a lot more in common</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">and particularly once there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">bit of common lingo it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">a reduction bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a refinement and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">connecting</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">um maybe gray you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">hi thank you guys i&#39;m loving this</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">session it&#39;s really energetic i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:26.960" style="s2">feeling like it&#39;s really alive for all</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">of us um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.960" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">curious about like how tight are the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">compartments</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">of these four different games does the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">deep game have</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">like prominent influences on your short</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">game does your short game go all the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:42.559" style="s2">to your deep game and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">good question uh the answer i think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.559" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">loose and personal</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">and the cool thing about it is once you</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">get the lingo and the spirit of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">you could go check your own which you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">which is what you really and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">where it really gets interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">there&#39;s no right or wrong in it</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">there&#39;s just what it is and what you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">tweak and once you start</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">noticing but one of the things i think a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:05.760" style="s2">lot of people notice once they look at</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.760" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">is the relationship between their</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">emotional space which is where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">problems show up</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">non-linguistic just</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have a thing to put it</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:19.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s where it presents</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">but part of that is because your long</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.599" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">game is jacked up</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">and no amount of you know pringles is</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">gonna fix it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">if that makes sense um but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:30.319" style="s2">really looking inside of you and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">once you get a sense if you know your</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.319" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">own four games well then you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">anything to apologize</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">a sense of calm comes on because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">not right or wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">but you can at least step back and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">from your point of view and then nobody</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">can make you wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">if that makes sense and you can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">really curious and admirable</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">about the parts that they have that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">different and then kind of meet on</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:56.319" style="s2">bits without any kind of dominator</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.319" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">going on yeah i actually have two uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">two images from jamie that i think are</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">fantastic ways to answer this i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">share my screen really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">so jamie continually comes back to this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">kind of nested</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">image where your inner is nested in your</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:17.839" style="s2">mid nested in your long nested in your</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">deep which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.839" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">absolutely correct and it kind of shows</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">proportion of influence like your deep</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">game your long game will</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">have a substantial impact</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">on what your short and mid actually end</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">up looking like you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">go the other way but i think it&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">think it&#39;s a lot harder</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">and then the other one i love is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">kind of taurus loop</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">um energetic donut where it actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">circles back in on itself right once you</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">once you wrap up a deep game it then</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.200" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">finds its way into well what does my</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.960" style="s2">tuesday look like based on that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">right if i suddenly believe that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.960" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">know i&#39;m following the kind of yoga</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">hindu philosophy well</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">you know the way i spend my day is going</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">to look a lot different and then it</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">trickles back up up up and then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">actually see like okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;m a dedicated practicing yogi now and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">reaffirms your relationship to your you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">know your long narrative and your deep</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:16.079" style="s2">game and it all just</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">circles back in on itself i think those</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.079" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">two really uh useful ways to to look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">how those things kind of play</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">play and dance with each other you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s fun in that sense of once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">got the lens for it you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">four games from the outside but then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">can do the thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">of getting inside their four games and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">looking from the app from the inside out</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">and sometimes if there&#39;s somebody that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">you really admire or feel connected to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">try that what is it like looking through</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">their eyes feeling that thoughts all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">same time you can get a connection</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">um with other people and learn on</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">different levels</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:55.359" style="s2">kind of non-linguistically uh so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">almost at the hour would you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.359" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">like five minutes to stay afterwards or</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">do you have to leave right at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">tower yeah um so maybe we&#39;ll just do</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">one or two questions or statements uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">margaret</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">uh you had a cool question uh or cool</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">statement if you can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">sure hi um so yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">whole conversation thank you jamie and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">eric very much for sharing this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">this whole conversation very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">reminds me of a game that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">i know i played briefly in childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">come back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">periodically throughout my life which</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">other people might have also played</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">essentially the game was you could not</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">mention the game and as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">mention the game you lose</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">and if you mention someone then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">cause them to lose as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">uh and this i mean it works with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">taurus model also of like an inverse</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">turning that inside out where instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">the rule being like you don&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">the game it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">we are all playing the game let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">that explicit and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">move from there</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s great that&#39;s great i</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.040" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">hadn&#39;t heard of that that does sound</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">like a fun game</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">but yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">of that and there&#39;s a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">again once you hold the lens lightly and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">you&#39;re not making a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">statement you can&#39;t escape the games you</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">can&#39;t not</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">play the games you can&#39;t leave your mid</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:22.640" style="s2">game you can&#39;t not you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">and then once you kind of accept that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.640" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">oh okay we&#39;re doing this vibe and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a happening and a lot of anxiety it</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:31.760" style="s2">seems to go away</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">but kind of in the spirit of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.760" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.280" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">not so much talking about swimming it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:47.760" style="s2">up the first thing about is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">reductionist it&#39;s all you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.760" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">sense of like no no captain simple and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">for me that&#39;s the first test there you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">go there&#39;s a short game of motion see</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">what that</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">feels like start anywhere um and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">that kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know sneakily simple um</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">which i think is kind of part of its</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">charm but you&#39;re right that is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">of first thing and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">um in these early days we kind of put it</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">out there without too much explaining</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">to attract people like you and like</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">peter who recognize it without</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">being explained too much because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">doing it well you&#39;re just not using the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">lingo um</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">so but to close up i would just say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">you know in my telling of the tale if</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">the nature of what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">get our four games together before</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">it&#39;s too late</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">and the headline coming out of the stowa</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">is hey maybe we&#39;re going to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:38.359" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take all these whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:40.240" style="s2">thinkers who can recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.359" end="00:58:41.839" style="s2">multi-dimensionality of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">but they&#39;ve got different lingos but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.839" end="00:58:46.079" style="s2">intention&#39;s good maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.599" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">next chance the stage of this long game</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.079" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">is some of us</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">start sharing a common lingo and moving</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:52.319" style="s2">the ball a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">sub projects in precisely the same way</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.319" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">peter&#39;s demonstrating with the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:59.119" style="s2">on a smaller scale so it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">like that&#39;s the nature of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.119" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">a positive long game looks out and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:05.200" style="s2">can be dressed up in any number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">but what i think eric and i are doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.200" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">are kind of going around and just</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">direct pointing to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:13.119" style="s2">already doing it well</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">and and i think that starts to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.119" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">community of this is how the long game</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">starts to think different people like</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">you doing things like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">and i think the non-obvious move is</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">there has to be a playful</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">frame to it because warframes and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">whatnot are just going to get you more</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:32.319" style="s2">war yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">yeah i guess i have two really quick</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.319" end="00:59:37.520" style="s2">comments uh to address</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">and your thing peter every person here</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.520" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">has probably seen</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">that kind of multi-panel cartoon where</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of dots and it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">is knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some connecting lines</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s like this experience and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">path and it&#39;s like this is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">everyone knows or has a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">the actual dots are they&#39;re like people</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">places things events whatever life</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">experience</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">what&#39;s the connective</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">tissue that puts all that together</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:07.119" style="s2">perhaps something like this it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.200" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">something that ties together all these</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.119" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">disparate things whether it&#39;s stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">your own life</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.680" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">whether it&#39;s different mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">whether it&#39;s different levels of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.359" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">the is going on</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:18.799" style="s2">uh and so actually like i say that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.799" end="01:00:22.720" style="s2">if done well this thing should actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">just disappear into the background</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">and serve just as connective scaffolding</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:29.359" style="s2">and never actually be</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:30.079" style="s2">need to be mentioned right but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.359" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">is that as it stands right now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.599" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">just a bunch of isolated islands</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:37.280" style="s2">doing a whole bunch of wicked stuff with</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">no real way of talking to each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.280" end="01:00:40.720" style="s2">or talking past each other or thinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">that they&#39;re actually doing different</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">things when they&#39;re doing the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">thing and so if there is if there can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:48.000" style="s2">this little connective tissue</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">that puts everything together which</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.000" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">again jamie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">relentlessly simple like four lenses</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:57.760" style="s2">with three things in each</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:01:00.240" style="s2">might be a fantastic way to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">and really my only closing comment is</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.240" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">one of the things i mentioned earlier</p>

<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">with me and that&#39;s literally why i&#39;m</p>
