<p begin="00:00:03.629" end="00:00:09.420" style="s2">problem I see with profit I took</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.980" end="00:00:12.769" style="s2">economics in school so I know a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.420" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">bit about economics macro and micro</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.769" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">usually when you are a producer of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.179" end="00:00:19.470" style="s2">something you&#39;re trying to maximize this</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">point where supply meets demand where if</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">you priced it too high you&#39;d have less</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">buyers and so your profit is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">lower if you price it too low you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:29.010" style="s2">going to not have as much profit per</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">piece so you&#39;re wanting to maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.010" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">amount of profit as an overall company&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">you want to have this sweet spot of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">price to get the most profit and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">graphs to show with that which one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">able to do this video because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">beyond my capabilities but I figure out</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">the other like there&#39;s another graph in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">my head that would be what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:54.449" style="s2">instead of profit being your number one</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">motivator like it isn&#39;t capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.449" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">purpose is your number one motivator</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:01.770" style="s2">because every business has a purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">a profit the purpose would I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.770" end="00:01:04.619" style="s2">purpose is for profit in most businesses</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the way you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.619" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">that profits your mission statement so a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">car company is getting transportation</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">needs met pharmaceutical company is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">getting health needs met it&#39;s meeting</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">the needs of its clients health needs</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s trying to make the most profit</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of trying to get the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:23.970" style="s2">customers at that price point to get the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">highest maximum profit which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.970" end="00:01:27.380" style="s2">mean setting the price point too high</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t mean setting it too low and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.380" end="00:01:32.840" style="s2">then profit goes to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.670" end="00:01:34.970" style="s2">started and took the risk either be</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.840" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">important Board of Directors see</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.970" end="00:01:39.259" style="s2">investors because they took a monetary</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">risk or the person came with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.259" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">the CEO who ever owns it all right you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:47.189" style="s2">can go per√≥n&#39;s it also through their</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">profits thrace sorry three shares so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.189" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">every dollar in my mind that goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">towards profit is a dollar that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">going towards purpose so if you make a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:59.790" style="s2">dollar and it goes to the investors it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">not going into research and development</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">or it&#39;s not going into making sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:08.489" style="s2">you&#39;re lowering that price point so more</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">people have access to it your so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.489" end="00:02:13.350" style="s2">it&#39;s undermining the purpose and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:14.610" style="s2">fine if your purpose is for profit</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.350" end="00:02:17.880" style="s2">every profit dollar you make your make</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.610" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">your doing your purpose but it&#39;s hurting</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.880" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">you overall I mean pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">companies are not my favorite but if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">are pharmaceutical company you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">business to make money clearly but your</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">underlying mission and purpose is to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">people or make people healthy or at</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">least keep them alive and every dollar</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna spend on profit and handing</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">out to your shareholders is a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.960" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">that&#39;s not being spent on your next</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:49.380" style="s2">piece of of medicine or isn&#39;t lowering</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:51.150" style="s2">the price point so more people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.380" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">access to it and in their paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.150" end="00:02:54.840" style="s2">makes complete sense so try to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:57.240" style="s2">profit not purpose but when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.840" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">trying to maximize purpose and you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.240" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">a pharmaceutical company that was done</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">for that then you&#39;re gonna want to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">that price point for that drug not free</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">because you still need to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:10.350" style="s2">able to have drugs in the future and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.800" style="s2">still want to be able to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.350" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">sustainable company but you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.800" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">able to set that price point where</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">you&#39;re able to help the most amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">people where you break even and breaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:26.510" style="s2">even means you pay for everything you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:29.400" style="s2">mean pay for R&amp;D you&#39;ve paid for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.510" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">place to manufacture it you plan for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.400" end="00:03:32.970" style="s2">testing you paid for all of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">employees and their benefits it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.970" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no profit on top of that because</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">once you start getting profit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">taking away from the purpose itself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">so I hope I explained that well why I</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:45.270" style="s2">think that there is a problem with with</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">profit it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s evil it just</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.270" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">means that every dollar that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">profit isn&#39;t going to purpose and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:54.210" style="s2">main every idea I have the purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:57.420" style="s2">greater than the profit so I want people</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.210" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">to be able to live meaningful amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.420" end="00:04:03.930" style="s2">abundant lives and when dollars are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:06.270" style="s2">going to excess instead of having needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.930" end="00:04:08.490" style="s2">met and having that joy created I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.270" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s inefficient and that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.490" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">trying to create a global cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:14.520" style="s2">which will be a non profit in the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:17.520" style="s2">that every dollar that&#39;s made is going</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.520" end="00:04:18.750" style="s2">back to the purpose and doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.520" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">that no one&#39;s making money as people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.750" end="00:04:23.250" style="s2">still gonna be paid a fair wage for what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">they&#39;re doing but there isn&#39;t that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.250" end="00:04:27.180" style="s2">risk reward where you&#39;re taking great</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">risk to hopefully to gamble on getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.180" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">reward and that profit isn&#39;t the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">purpose is the purpose and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">conversations were having so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">having conversations about how to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:41.160" style="s2">the most money we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">conversations about how to make the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.160" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">impact with what we have money will be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">factor in that but not the highest</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.009" style="s2">factor and we&#39;re not having</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">conversations on how to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.009" end="00:04:56.250" style="s2">create jobs because that is a profit</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">they even it&#39;s some but we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.250" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">have people live non poverty lives which</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">means they need to have food on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">table they need to have a roof over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:05.570" style="s2">head which and conversations need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:08.009" style="s2">have in solutions we need to generate</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.570" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">but if every solution needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.009" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">profit in it it&#39;s just it&#39;s inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:15.570" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna get into that more in</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:15.979" style="s2">other videos what that was today is day</p>
