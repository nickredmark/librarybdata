<p begin="00:01:20.770" end="00:01:26.680" style="s2">the whole proposal is that we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.520" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">render everything into equations and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.680" end="00:01:34.570" style="s2">that if we mathematically manipulate</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.450" end="00:02:03.310" style="s2">at the time and so I noted that we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.000" end="00:02:05.530" style="s2">we had two different elements in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.310" end="00:02:07.810" style="s2">grammar that are in significant tension</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.530" end="00:02:10.540" style="s2">with each other from and they and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.810" end="00:02:12.489" style="s2">both they share that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.540" end="00:02:15.880" style="s2">interesting about them I think they</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.489" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">share they overlap significantly in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.880" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">idea of the isolated individual mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:27.250" style="s2">whereas Luther&#39;s going to put an</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.940" end="00:02:29.170" style="s2">emphasis on conscience</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:31.000" style="s2">well des cartes going to put in emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.170" end="00:02:33.220" style="s2">as we&#39;ll see we began to see last time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.000" end="00:02:34.660" style="s2">will now call consciousness although of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:37.690" style="s2">course these two words are highly</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.660" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">related in nature but on one side we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.690" end="00:02:44.590" style="s2">have the the grammar from Luther telling</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:46.660" style="s2">us that we need to accept without</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.590" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">question without evidence without</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.660" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">argumentation and then Descartes is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">should only accept that when we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">certainty and neither one of those is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:03:02.320" style="s2">viable for us they&#39;re both pathological</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.540" end="00:03:06.460" style="s2">in a very deep way but we saw that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.320" end="00:03:10.330" style="s2">Descartes nevertheless proposes this new</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.460" end="00:03:12.550" style="s2">method a method again it&#39;s similar in so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.330" end="00:03:14.290" style="s2">many ways to essential features of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.550" end="00:03:16.270" style="s2">Protestant Reformation a method cut off</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.290" end="00:03:18.880" style="s2">from tradition a method cut off from</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.270" end="00:03:21.220" style="s2">institution a method that relies just on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.880" end="00:03:25.660" style="s2">the individual mind in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.220" end="00:03:28.210" style="s2">itself so although in some one way in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.660" end="00:03:30.190" style="s2">one sense these two grammars the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.210" end="00:03:32.620" style="s2">Lutheran grammar and the Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.190" end="00:03:34.870" style="s2">grammar seems so opposed in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.620" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">and these grammars are at war in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.870" end="00:03:40.780" style="s2">current culture war the war between an</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:46.090" style="s2">idea an understanding of faith as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.780" end="00:03:49.060" style="s2">radical acceptance and knowledge as the</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.060" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">although they are that that grammatical</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:55.870" style="s2">tension is at the core of a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:03:59.170" style="s2">cultural Wars</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.870" end="00:04:01.209" style="s2">nevertheless these two views are so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.170" end="00:04:03.550" style="s2">deeply bound together because of their</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.209" end="00:04:06.610" style="s2">mutual influence and their shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.550" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">commitment to the isolated individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.610" end="00:04:14.380" style="s2">self Descartes has a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:17.530" style="s2">contemporaries as I mentioned Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.380" end="00:04:22.590" style="s2">will come back to Pascal in a bit but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.530" end="00:04:25.690" style="s2">also talked about Hobbes right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.590" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">Hobbes comes up with the radical</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:33.610" style="s2">proposal that following on Descartes if</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">cognition is computation and if matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.610" end="00:04:39.820" style="s2">is real then we can build a material</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:44.140" style="s2">computer and we could artificially make</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:45.970" style="s2">Nishan artificial intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.140" end="00:04:50.020" style="s2">product of the Scientific Revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.970" end="00:04:55.270" style="s2">is part and parcel of right the advent</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.020" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">of the meaning crisis in modernity now</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.270" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">what I want to do is take some time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:02.710" style="s2">look at these two interactions that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:05.620" style="s2">mentioned draw them out a bit we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.710" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">Descartes versus Hobbes and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.620" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">Descartes and Pascal what we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:18.700" style="s2">from these interactions because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:22.480" style="s2">pivotal and we are now going to remind</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.700" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">ourselves that the idea of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.480" end="00:05:27.970" style="s2">intelligence is deeply relevant to both</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:29.710" style="s2">the Scientific Revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.970" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">meaning crisis I&#39;ve shown you how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.710" end="00:05:33.430" style="s2">relevant to the Scientific Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">and I pointed out last time that it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:37.750" style="s2">deeply relevant to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:39.970" style="s2">because Hobbes with the proposal of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.750" end="00:05:45.180" style="s2">artificial intelligence proposes to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.970" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">finish the swath of death that has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.180" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">created by Galileo killing the universe</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:54.220" style="s2">for example and what Hobbes is doing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:56.710" style="s2">killing the human soul and of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.220" end="00:06:00.100" style="s2">that&#39;s going to exacerbate the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.710" end="00:06:04.120" style="s2">narcissism because if we no longer have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.100" end="00:06:06.910" style="s2">souls then finding our uniqueness and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.120" end="00:06:09.990" style="s2">our true self the self that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.910" end="00:06:13.300" style="s2">to be true to becomes extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.990" end="00:06:17.500" style="s2">paradoxical in problematic if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.300" end="00:06:20.470" style="s2">have a soul what is it to be true to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.500" end="00:06:23.140" style="s2">your true self and what is it that makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.470" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">you really unique and special from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.140" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">rest of the purposeless meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:31.630" style="s2">cosmos so these are going to be crucial</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:35.290" style="s2">questions now I want to take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.630" end="00:06:37.900" style="s2">how Descartes responds to Hobbes because</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:40.360" style="s2">that&#39;s going to make clear to us again</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.900" end="00:06:43.480" style="s2">both the scientific import and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.360" end="00:06:46.900" style="s2">existential relevance of the AI project</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.480" end="00:06:50.320" style="s2">and it&#39;ll also make clear deeper</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.900" end="00:06:52.830" style="s2">problems that we are now facing in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.320" end="00:06:56.020" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.830" end="00:07:00.520" style="s2">alright now here&#39;s where it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.020" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">to make make clear how we should treat</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.520" end="00:07:06.430" style="s2">Descartes so it&#39;s very fashionable</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">philosophically and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.430" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">scientifically to blame Descartes for</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.000" end="00:07:14.979" style="s2">many many mistakes there&#39;s a famous book</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:16.750" style="s2">by DiMaggio a book that in other</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.979" end="00:07:17.139" style="s2">respects I think very highly of des</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.750" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">cartes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.139" end="00:07:22.410" style="s2">error right and we&#39;ll talk about all</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:22.410" style="s2">this stuff later</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.740" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">however I mean if I were to put it in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">sentence I wish I had made des cartes</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:32.740" style="s2">mistakes Descartes is titanically</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:36.460" style="s2">brilliant and the mistakes he makes are</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.740" end="00:07:39.930" style="s2">so foundational to our culture so woven</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.849" end="00:07:47.860" style="s2">easy task why I say this is because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.880" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">want to look at how Descartes actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.860" end="00:07:53.590" style="s2">rejects Hobbes&#39;s proposal of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:55.690" style="s2">intelligence and why that rejection is</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.610" end="00:17:17.630" style="s2">that&#39;s not historically accurate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.140" end="00:17:21.920" style="s2">a particular view that we see from</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.630" end="00:17:25.730" style="s2">Descartes secondly Descartes himself</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.920" end="00:17:28.850" style="s2">rejects that because he realizes that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.730" end="00:17:31.160" style="s2">rationality is caring about the truth on</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.850" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">purpose according to normative standards</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.160" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">and values and none of that machinery</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:39.470" style="s2">can actually be found in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:41.300" style="s2">model of matter so you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.470" end="00:17:43.390" style="s2">actually deeply mysterious in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.300" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">culture right now although it is invoked</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.390" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">religiously and I mean that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:57.680" style="s2">the notion of rationality itself this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">not me advocating irrationality not at</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:05.510" style="s2">I am against the ad vacations of it as</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.420" end="00:18:25.300" style="s2">no there&#39;s more des cartes going to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.540" end="00:18:28.570" style="s2">more in order to say that we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.300" end="00:18:36.520" style="s2">back to Galileo what more does Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.570" end="00:18:39.810" style="s2">say to Hobbes what more does Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.520" end="00:18:44.800" style="s2">say to Hobbes Hobbes says well look</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.810" end="00:18:45.970" style="s2">Galileo had this problem alright and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.800" end="00:18:49.540" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about it but let&#39;s go over</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.970" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">it again mathematics is the language of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.540" end="00:18:59.590" style="s2">reality ultimately a platonic idea right</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:19:01.000" style="s2">and then you get the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.590" end="00:19:02.830" style="s2">two kinds of properties there are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.000" end="00:19:07.000" style="s2">properties that are immeasurable by math</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.830" end="00:19:10.840" style="s2">those are the primary properties the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.000" end="00:19:13.270" style="s2">primary qualities the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.840" end="00:19:15.790" style="s2">mathematically measurable and although</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.270" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">the term isn&#39;t quite used this way in de</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.790" end="00:19:19.740" style="s2">cartes time shortly thereafter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:22.060" style="s2">going to come to take on this meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.740" end="00:19:23.560" style="s2">the mathematical properties or</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.550" end="00:19:32.260" style="s2">involved with them so if I can measure</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.470" end="00:19:38.650" style="s2">it mathematically it&#39;s in the object its</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.260" end="00:19:40.870" style="s2">objective but of course Galileo faced</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.650" end="00:19:43.990" style="s2">the fact that many qualities of</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.610" end="00:19:56.260" style="s2">Galileo noted that many qualities are</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.770" end="00:20:00.940" style="s2">not mathematically describable how</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.300" end="00:20:18.310" style="s2">here the these are these were called</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.490" end="00:20:20.800" style="s2">secondary qualities and the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.310" end="00:20:24.070" style="s2">and notice how this follows on</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.800" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">procurement Copernicus these don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.070" end="00:20:28.550" style="s2">in the object they</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:14.420" style="s2">this right philosophers have a nice way</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.890" end="00:21:17.090" style="s2">of talking about these secondary</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.130" end="00:21:33.800" style="s2">only in the mind and that these make up</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.720" end="00:21:34.940" style="s2">an important part and there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.800" end="00:21:37.310" style="s2">of debate about this I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.940" end="00:21:40.390" style="s2">try and resolve that here but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.310" end="00:21:44.140" style="s2">these qualia are central to</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.570" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">Descartes is emphasizing consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:57.800" style="s2">now here&#39;s the idea what the Scientific</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:22:00.620" style="s2">Revolution showed it one of its big</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.800" end="00:22:05.780" style="s2">insights is this is in the world in</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.780" end="00:22:16.550" style="s2">is only in mind and then what you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:20.290" style="s2">say to Hobbes is the following and many</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.550" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">philosophers I&#39;ve said it repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.290" end="00:22:27.620" style="s2">Thomas Nagel comes to mind and many</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:31.780" style="s2">others right matter does not possess</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.890" end="00:23:29.929" style="s2">it was very quickly derived from other</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:51.350" style="s2">itself and then Descartes right famously</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:54.049" style="s2">worries about that he says I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.350" end="00:23:58.220" style="s2">doubt everything tried to find something</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.160" end="00:24:06.049" style="s2">important he makes a mistake about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.410" end="00:24:08.840" style="s2">notion of certainty there&#39;s two notions</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.049" end="00:24:11.990" style="s2">of certainty there&#39;s a logical notion in</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.780" end="00:33:45.180" style="s2">that goes to the core of us now you may</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.620" end="00:33:47.370" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.180" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2">some of you perhaps also if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.370" end="00:33:51.900" style="s2">religious orientation and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:53.730" style="s2">insulting you here I am not insulting</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.900" end="00:33:55.590" style="s2">you because you might think well Hobbes</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.730" end="00:33:57.270" style="s2">tries to kill the soul and these</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.590" end="00:33:59.460" style="s2">arguments from Descartes they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.270" end="00:34:02.820" style="s2">preserve the notion of a soul and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.460" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">great because if I have a soul then of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.820" end="00:34:07.110" style="s2">course then immortality is a real</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">possibility for me well be careful you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.110" end="00:34:13.080" style="s2">may not want the Cartesian baby okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:17.610" style="s2">even though you&#39;re trying to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.080" end="00:34:21.240" style="s2">the materialistic bathwater because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.610" end="00:34:29.000" style="s2">problem with de cartes solution is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.240" end="00:34:31.890" style="s2">existential cost it&#39;s existential cost</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.000" end="00:34:36.140" style="s2">because what Descartes was basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.890" end="00:34:41.100" style="s2">arguing for is that mind and matter are</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.140" end="00:34:45.000" style="s2">essentially different they share no</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.100" end="00:34:49.410" style="s2">fundamental properties mind moves on</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.000" end="00:34:53.640" style="s2">purpose it moves according to values it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.410" end="00:34:56.730" style="s2">works in terms of meaning and qualia it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.640" end="00:34:59.730" style="s2">cares about and pursues the truth and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.730" end="00:35:05.310" style="s2">has this kind of contact with itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.730" end="00:35:09.350" style="s2">that no material thing has whereas</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.310" end="00:35:16.380" style="s2">matter is extended in space and time</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.350" end="00:35:19.110" style="s2">displays force transfers energy so all</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.380" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">the properties that mind has matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.110" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have and all the properties that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:27.480" style="s2">matter has mind doesn&#39;t have so</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:29.880" style="s2">Descartes of course came to a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.480" end="00:35:31.980" style="s2">conclusion that mind and matter are two</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.880" end="00:35:33.540" style="s2">radically different kinds of things mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.980" end="00:35:35.370" style="s2">is a completely immaterial substance</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.540" end="00:35:40.460" style="s2">matter of course is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.370" end="00:35:44.730" style="s2">material substance and you may say yay</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.460" end="00:35:46.680" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem if mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.730" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">share no properties how do they causally</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.680" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">interact</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:56.210" style="s2">how do they causally interact here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.970" end="00:35:57.289" style="s2">going to show you mind over matter I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.210" end="00:36:04.069" style="s2">thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.289" end="00:36:05.779" style="s2">I desire water because water is good so</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.779" end="00:36:11.779" style="s2">so notice all these mental terms desire</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.299" end="00:36:13.250" style="s2">and want and I value the water and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.779" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">gonna move on purpose and here I do I</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.250" end="00:36:21.230" style="s2">move and I get some water that&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">making matter change but how can I do</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.230" end="00:36:26.260" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:26.260" style="s2">mind has no energy doesn&#39;t take up space</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.650" end="00:36:34.220" style="s2">alright doesn&#39;t have any force what</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.270" end="00:36:37.400" style="s2">about the reverse can matter ever a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.220" end="00:36:39.109" style="s2">cause mind here we go behold I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.400" end="00:36:40.910" style="s2">to start with a completely material</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.109" end="00:36:46.970" style="s2">event and it&#39;s going to end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.910" end="00:36:49.160" style="s2">completely mental event ow two pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.970" end="00:36:56.390" style="s2">matter slam into each other and the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.160" end="00:36:58.940" style="s2">result is pain what&#39;s pain well that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.940" end="00:37:04.930" style="s2">your experience how much does pain weigh</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.079" end="00:37:10.670" style="s2">does it even mean make sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.430" end="00:37:12.920" style="s2">color is it what&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.119" end="00:37:41.480" style="s2">yet de cartes whole position the way he</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.839" end="00:37:43.819" style="s2">responds to hobbes makes it impossible</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.480" end="00:37:47.089" style="s2">that they can interact because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.819" end="00:37:49.460" style="s2">share no properties in virtue of which</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.089" end="00:37:52.369" style="s2">they can interact because he used that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.460" end="00:37:54.740" style="s2">gap to argue against hobbes because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.369" end="00:37:57.470" style="s2">the gap between matter scientific matter</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.740" end="00:37:57.890" style="s2">and mind that de cartes uses against</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.890" end="00:38:03.289" style="s2">but the problem is that gap undermines</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.609" end="00:38:04.310" style="s2">your whole existence because what does</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.310" end="00:38:10.610" style="s2">means you are radically cut off from</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.390" end="00:38:26.110" style="s2">of your experience the taste of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.060" end="00:38:29.720" style="s2">water is absurd because there&#39;s no way</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.720" end="00:38:34.190" style="s2">and the water which is a physical thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.120" end="00:38:42.020" style="s2">could in any way be related to each</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.190" end="00:38:44.420" style="s2">other but it&#39;s worse because look around</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.020" end="00:38:46.310" style="s2">you there&#39;s another person how do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.420" end="00:38:47.960" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on in their mind do</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.310" end="00:38:48.350" style="s2">you directly see their mind of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.960" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.350" end="00:38:53.030" style="s2">well how do I know are they utter words</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:54.110" style="s2">well no they don&#39;t they make sounds when</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.030" end="00:38:56.060" style="s2">we talked about remember what Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.110" end="00:38:58.490" style="s2">says to Hobbes there&#39;s nothing in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.060" end="00:39:00.530" style="s2">sounds that&#39;s meaningful their face</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.490" end="00:39:04.100" style="s2">moves and they make gestures and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.530" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">express their emotions so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.100" end="00:39:08.630" style="s2">saying is you get what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:11.570" style="s2">somebody&#39;s mind because of the way their</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.630" end="00:39:14.150" style="s2">physical body moves and makes other</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.570" end="00:39:16.520" style="s2">physical things like air move but if</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.150" end="00:39:19.130" style="s2">there is no connection between mind and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.520" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">matter and your body is a purely</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">disagree with that then there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.570" end="00:39:29.180" style="s2">by paying attention to body I can figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:34.910" style="s2">out what&#39;s going on in mind because</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.180" end="00:39:37.070" style="s2">there&#39;s no connection between them this</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.910" end="00:39:38.750" style="s2">is called the problem of other minds how</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.070" end="00:39:40.460" style="s2">do I know and Descartes seriously</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.750" end="00:39:43.070" style="s2">worried about this how do I know that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.460" end="00:39:47.600" style="s2">the rest of you are not just mindless</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.070" end="00:39:51.350" style="s2">automatons not just zombies how do I</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.600" end="00:39:53.150" style="s2">know this because the only the only mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.350" end="00:39:56.200" style="s2">that my mind touches according to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.150" end="00:39:56.200" style="s2">Descartes is itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.980" end="00:40:05.670" style="s2">well at least the mind is still in</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.200" end="00:40:07.650" style="s2">contact with the world with Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.670" end="00:40:10.170" style="s2">right John because the math touches the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.650" end="00:40:12.150" style="s2">world aha be careful there des cartes</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.170" end="00:40:15.720" style="s2">given us two different answers</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.150" end="00:40:19.950" style="s2">he said the math tells us what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.720" end="00:40:26.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s objective but the mind touching</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.950" end="00:40:28.680" style="s2">itself in consciousness is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.070" end="00:40:33.210" style="s2">the touchstone and I use that touchstone</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.680" end="00:40:34.700" style="s2">of reality it&#39;s purely subjective and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.210" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">what we have are these two different</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.700" end="00:40:44.220" style="s2">standards of realness subjective</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:46.050" style="s2">consciousness objective math and so what</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.220" end="00:40:48.510" style="s2">our society our culture has now done</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.050" end="00:40:49.290" style="s2">historically is Carine back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.510" end="00:40:50.970" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.290" end="00:40:56.430" style="s2">you get you know the empiricists and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.970" end="00:40:59.400" style="s2">positivist right no science tells me</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.430" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">what&#39;s real and then all you say well</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.400" end="00:41:03.720" style="s2">how do you know it&#39;s not a dream</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:05.400" style="s2">oh well haha silly silly silly nobody</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.720" end="00:41:09.270" style="s2">really pays any attention of that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.400" end="00:41:11.820" style="s2">what you get are insults you get insults</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.270" end="00:41:15.420" style="s2">and ad hominem arguments it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.820" end="00:41:17.580" style="s2">no no answer oh well you know it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.420" end="00:41:19.110" style="s2">then we invoke rationality and what do</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.580" end="00:41:21.540" style="s2">you mean by rationality and how does</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.110" end="00:41:23.640" style="s2">rationality fit into this mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.540" end="00:41:26.250" style="s2">realized world when we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.640" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">mathematical material way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.250" end="00:41:30.810" style="s2">about purpose and truth etc it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:32.730" style="s2">problematic so you swing the other way</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.810" end="00:41:35.070" style="s2">and you come over here and you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.730" end="00:41:36.330" style="s2">Romantics I don&#39;t mean the rock group</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.070" end="00:41:39.750" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean like romantic love</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.330" end="00:41:40.590" style="s2">right we&#39;ll talk about these guys in a</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.590" end="00:41:47.880" style="s2">so what&#39;s ultimately real is my spear</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.650" end="00:41:52.770" style="s2">subjective experience right but then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.880" end="00:41:54.090" style="s2">problem with that is well how is that to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.770" end="00:41:55.530" style="s2">be in touch with the world how is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.090" end="00:41:57.710" style="s2">to be in touch with other people how&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.590" end="00:42:11.369" style="s2">that and so I go back and forth and back</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.080" end="00:42:14.890" style="s2">and forth so what Descartes actually gay</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.369" end="00:42:15.700" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a secure way of being in contact</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.890" end="00:42:18.280" style="s2">with reality</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.369" end="00:43:00.670" style="s2">we found we&#39;ve seen a gradual loss of</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.209" end="00:47:01.390" style="s2">of that in cartesian terms I would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.709" end="00:47:03.069" style="s2">today the spirit of math or the spirit</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.949" end="00:47:30.729" style="s2">being in terms of the spirit of geometry</p>
