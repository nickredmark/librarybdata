<p begin="00:00:07.130" end="00:00:10.980" style="s2">hey folks welcome to the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.110" end="00:00:13.320" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.980" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">I am Brett Weinstein and I am sitting</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.320" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2">here with Eric our Weinstein PhD who</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2">happens to be my brother and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">to attempt to interview him and raise in</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">discussion many topics on which he may</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:29.550" style="s2">be the most interest interesting voice</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">that we have access to in civilization</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.550" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">so here goes nothing</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">Eric welcome to the dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">but no pressure no pressure great to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">here on the dark earth so some people</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">have seen us together on occasion</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:47.399" style="s2">episode 19 of the portal they will have</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">seen a discussion in which you forced me</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.399" end="00:00:53.460" style="s2">to reveal things about my scientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">past that were little known before that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.460" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">episode I have to say was a scary</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">episode but arguably was a more</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">interesting podcast of all time I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:05.689" style="s2">say thanks to your your story in your</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">work well it was quite an adventure and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.689" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">anyway I want to thank you for doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">it absolutely added an important</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">dimension to my life especially my</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">public life in an area where I had more</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">or less shelved prior work and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">it was time that it returned we will</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">come back to that story later I of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">course know a great deal about your</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">history I also find out frequently that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">there are things I don&#39;t know about your</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">history that emerge in conversations</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">with other people on podcasts and things</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">so anyway I&#39;m wondering what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">I should be asking to reveal that which</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">I do not yet know for our listeners and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">our viewers you are a PhD in mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">yes your degree came from Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">correct your advisor was I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">an advisor but wicked Wikipedia claims</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">that it is the person who signed my</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">thesis who is Raoul but Raoul about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">very famous mathematician and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">interesting good man</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">arguably could have maybe his</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">periodicity theorem could be argued to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:12.440" style="s2">be the theorem of the 20th century I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:14.190" style="s2">make that case but he was not my advisor</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.440" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">highly regarded</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.190" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">a friend of yours but not your advisor</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">now I should say those who did not go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">graduate school in a science or some</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:30.840" style="s2">some topic will probably not understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:33.330" style="s2">how unusual it is to be a to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.840" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">Doctorate without having had an advisor</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.330" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">in fact I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">another case of that ever well in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">they won&#39;t even let you say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:47.160" style="s2">true even when it&#39;s true because it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">supposed to be perceived that aid an</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">advisor is essential to getting a PhD</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:53.700" style="s2">which of course there&#39;s no reason that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">that should be true and it isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.700" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">however the system expects that just the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">way it can ask where did you go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">college rather than did you go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">college if you have a PhD it asks who is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">your advisor and it assumes that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">has to be a condition that is met so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:15.710" style="s2">those who are familiar with your work</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">and your podcast will be well aware of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.710" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">the uneasy relationship that we both</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">have and you have been very public about</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">with respect to gatekeeping the day</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">keeping is playing some role in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">system that many people believe is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">positive in the sense that something has</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">to be prevented from getting through the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:34.380" style="s2">gate but when you actually encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:37.350" style="s2">gatekeepers it&#39;s not what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.380" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">it depends I don&#39;t think either you or I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.350" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">would want to be in a world with no gate</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:43.800" style="s2">keeping my guess is that neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:47.269" style="s2">thinks that the gatekeeping that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.800" end="00:03:54.510" style="s2">being done is of the quality to warrant</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.269" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">a gate yeah I mean I would say maybe my</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.510" end="00:04:00.090" style="s2">signature issue has been captured and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">that gates are one more thing where the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.090" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">problem is there is a genuine version</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">but we haven&#39;t seen it in so long that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:09.810" style="s2">we only see the malignant variety and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">become those of us who have nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.810" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">run into these gatekeepers have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:15.570" style="s2">sense of just like wipe that thing out</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">of the way because it&#39;s nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.570" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">that&#39;s right in our weaker moments I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">think that the feeling is get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:24.450" style="s2">goddamn gatekeepers and I think that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">our stronger moments I had essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:29.370" style="s2">until 2001</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:32.340" style="s2">never encountered a new academic subject</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.370" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">in which the subject was hungry for new</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.340" end="00:04:40.230" style="s2">ideas and so when I tried to publish my</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">first paper in finance and the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.230" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">risk it was a astounding experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">because the field was hungry for new</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">ideas and to open up new fields so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">gave me an idea of well what must</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">biology or physics or economics have</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:05:00.270" style="s2">been like when people were struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:02.100" style="s2">find a paradigm rather than to defend a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.270" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">bad paradigm for those who would point</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.100" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">out its flaws yeah my experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.890" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">I check in on fields that I&#39;m capable of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.860" style="s2">evaluating which should be as many fewer</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:15.960" style="s2">than you are but nonetheless there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.860" end="00:05:18.030" style="s2">range of biological fields for example I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.960" end="00:05:20.250" style="s2">can check in on them and in general I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.030" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">find them asleep they&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.250" end="00:05:23.190" style="s2">anything interesting they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">spinning their wheels and then sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.190" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">I will check in on one after some period</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:31.200" style="s2">away and I&#39;ll discover whoa something</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:33.870" style="s2">has happened here and it it has caused</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:37.590" style="s2">me to think that there&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.870" end="00:05:40.169" style="s2">process that produces stuckness and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.590" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">that stuckness is it&#39;s not inherent to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.169" end="00:05:44.550" style="s2">the science it&#39;s inherent to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.300" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">sociology surrounding the way science is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.550" end="00:05:49.710" style="s2">done and that it&#39;s very hard to break</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">these things loose but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.710" end="00:05:54.690" style="s2">something does and we see interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.090" style="s2">things but how much more productive</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.690" end="00:05:58.590" style="s2">would we be if stuckness did not</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:06:00.330" style="s2">characterize most fields most of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.590" end="00:06:03.090" style="s2">time well I think it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:05.820" style="s2">interesting question I believe that many</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:08.340" style="s2">people reflexively quote plunk that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.820" end="00:06:10.290" style="s2">science proceeds funeral by funeral but</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.340" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s not an addendum so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.290" end="00:06:13.890" style="s2">as a pre zdenda minor you know what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:16.530" style="s2">right language to cop - call it a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.890" end="00:06:19.650" style="s2">preamble which it would be that when a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.530" end="00:06:23.820" style="s2">scientific field is broken it can only</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.650" end="00:06:24.840" style="s2">advance funeral by funeral and that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.820" end="00:06:27.000" style="s2">the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.840" end="00:06:29.250" style="s2">well-functioning field and a poorly</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.000" end="00:06:32.820" style="s2">functioning field whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.250" end="00:06:34.950" style="s2">requires the death of the licen coasst</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.820" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">s-- if you will who are holding back</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.950" end="00:06:40.539" style="s2">reality wonderful now</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:43.060" style="s2">we can talk and hopefully we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.539" end="00:06:46.300" style="s2">later in this podcast to possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.060" end="00:06:48.129" style="s2">remedies for the problem but for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.300" end="00:06:50.590" style="s2">moment I think the thing that is most</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.129" end="00:06:53.020" style="s2">pressing is for me to try to do for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.590" end="00:06:55.060" style="s2">what you did for me on your podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.020" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">the problem is I&#39;m not equipped to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.060" end="00:07:01.539" style="s2">the job that is to say your area of I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:03.460" style="s2">don&#39;t want to use the word expertise</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.539" end="00:07:05.590" style="s2">because you and I both find something</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.460" end="00:07:08.530" style="s2">problematic about what expertise has</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.590" end="00:07:13.629" style="s2">become but your primary area of interest</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:15.940" style="s2">your focus is in higher math which at</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.629" end="00:07:18.129" style="s2">some point essentially becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.940" end="00:07:23.099" style="s2">indistinguishable from or so</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.129" end="00:07:25.960" style="s2">intermingled with physics that they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.099" end="00:07:27.460" style="s2">proceeding in tandem is that fair that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.960" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">they are the same subject how would you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.460" end="00:07:33.099" style="s2">say it so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a great question I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:36.719" style="s2">would say that there&#39;s an expression</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.099" end="00:07:40.889" style="s2">that the map is not the territory and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.719" end="00:07:46.210" style="s2">theoretical physics in its foundational</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.889" end="00:07:48.880" style="s2">subset that is the the discovery of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.210" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">reality is at its deepest level deepest</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.880" end="00:07:54.219" style="s2">physical level is the one place where we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:57.430" style="s2">think that perhaps the map is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.219" end="00:07:59.620" style="s2">territory right so in other words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.430" end="00:08:02.889" style="s2">like being handed Greenland as a map of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.620" end="00:08:05.529" style="s2">Greenland so I&#39;ve heard you say this and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.889" end="00:08:07.449" style="s2">it has a how it&#39;s almost an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.529" end="00:08:09.400" style="s2">meaning to me but I cannot make it work</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.449" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">analytically I can&#39;t understand what</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.400" end="00:08:13.539" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to tell me and so I more</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:16.060" style="s2">or less think the way to do what needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.539" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">to be done with respect to your work and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.060" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">what&#39;s probably going to end up being</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">your greatest contribution the way to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:26.349" style="s2">it is for me to reveal what I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:28.779" style="s2">and have you try to fill me in and just</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.349" end="00:08:30.490" style="s2">by being courageous about looking stupid</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.779" end="00:08:31.990" style="s2">maybe we can get to a place where a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.490" end="00:08:33.789" style="s2">of people will suddenly have access to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.990" end="00:08:35.050" style="s2">what it is you&#39;re saying we&#39;re normally</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.789" end="00:08:36.789" style="s2">very few well first of all I find the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.050" end="00:08:40.300" style="s2">dark the dark horse to be a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.789" end="00:08:42.909" style="s2">interesting podcast and so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.300" end="00:08:45.250" style="s2">that it that you were pioneering some</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.909" end="00:08:48.760" style="s2">new thing I&#39;m willing to guinea pig all</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.250" end="00:08:52.630" style="s2">right so when you say the map is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.760" end="00:08:55.270" style="s2">territory I mean I was just based on our</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.630" end="00:08:56.920" style="s2">nature I was thinking about a joke as</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.270" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">you were describing the math being the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.920" end="00:09:00.400" style="s2">territory about you know welcome to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:02.650" style="s2">map or something along those lines so</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.400" end="00:09:06.910" style="s2">what does it mean that the map is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.650" end="00:09:09.550" style="s2">territory is the idea that when you so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.910" end="00:09:11.800" style="s2">that we tell ourselves map like stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.550" end="00:09:13.780" style="s2">in every discipline all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.800" end="00:09:15.550" style="s2">sometimes those maps are so good for our</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.780" end="00:09:18.100" style="s2">purposes that we think we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.550" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">about reality but it&#39;s always models and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.100" end="00:09:26.410" style="s2">are you telling me that in math somehow</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:28.780" style="s2">as we actually discover what&#39;s true you</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.410" end="00:09:32.950" style="s2">converge on reality is that your point</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.780" end="00:09:38.590" style="s2">we don&#39;t know whether when Albert</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.950" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">Einstein said let X be a four</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.590" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">dimensional manifold with a three one</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">metric and we will call it space-time we</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether in some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:51.490" style="s2">weird sentence before the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">space-time is an actual description of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.490" end="00:09:59.830" style="s2">what space-time is or whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:10:02.440" style="s2">is a model of what space-time is so go</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.830" end="00:10:05.110" style="s2">ahead yeah so the the problem here is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.440" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">that when Magritte for example paints</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.110" end="00:10:10.270" style="s2">this famous painting that says Sistine</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:12.190" style="s2">upon beep this is not a pipe he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.270" end="00:10:14.770" style="s2">literally correct because it&#39;s a picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.190" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">of a pipe not a pipe mm-hmm smoking pipe</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.770" end="00:10:20.050" style="s2">yeah well in some sense we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:23.500" style="s2">whether Albert Einstein painted a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.050" end="00:10:26.500" style="s2">picture of space-time which he called a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.500" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">a manifold with a 3-1 metric or 1/3</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.500" end="00:10:33.280" style="s2">metric or whether or not he actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">described what there was at base level</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.280" end="00:10:37.450" style="s2">and there was nothing left to find so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">for example if we came to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.450" end="00:10:45.970" style="s2">that what he called space-time was made</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:47.890" style="s2">up of tiny granular bits and that there</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.970" end="00:10:50.070" style="s2">was a resolution and a granularity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.890" end="00:10:53.590" style="s2">space-time then it wouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.070" end="00:10:59.100" style="s2">continuous view beautiful expanse it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.590" end="00:10:59.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a continuum mm-hmm so if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:04.690" style="s2">we don&#39;t know the answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.080" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">about whether or not at the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.690" end="00:11:08.680" style="s2">theoretical physics you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">is a collection of mathematical concepts</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.680" end="00:11:13.269" style="s2">or whether they&#39;re a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">mathematical models and the concepts are</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.269" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">reality or the concepts model reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:21.579" style="s2">okay now I&#39;m gonna play the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:23.529" style="s2">smart graduate student trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.579" end="00:11:25.240" style="s2">professor&#39;s attention by saying things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.529" end="00:11:27.190" style="s2">that are shockingly clever I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.240" end="00:11:30.430" style="s2">if I want to pull it off let&#39;s say two</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.190" end="00:11:32.139" style="s2">things one we have a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.430" end="00:11:33.639" style="s2">Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle which</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.139" end="00:11:36.579" style="s2">is that we don&#39;t know if it describes</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.639" end="00:11:38.620" style="s2">actual uncertainty or uncertainty at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.579" end="00:11:39.790" style="s2">level that one measures that is not real</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.620" end="00:11:41.560" style="s2">in other words we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.790" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">completely deterministic universe in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.560" end="00:11:47.350" style="s2">which inside of the universe we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:49.389" style="s2">nail down all parameters simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.350" end="00:11:51.850" style="s2">and therefore we get the appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.389" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">uncertainty is this a case where we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.850" end="00:11:56.860" style="s2">not know if Heisenberg has presented us</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:12:00.130" style="s2">the map or the territory good good</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.860" end="00:12:02.260" style="s2">question so in the late 1970s there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.130" end="00:12:04.750" style="s2">a riff there was a revolution or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.260" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">the mid-1970s even that we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.750" end="00:12:09.100" style="s2">about called geometric quantization so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:12.430" style="s2">you can look up it has their books on</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.100" end="00:12:14.500" style="s2">geometric quantization and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.430" end="00:12:17.140" style="s2">ideas inside of geometric quantization</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.500" end="00:12:21.250" style="s2">is that Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.140" end="00:12:23.890" style="s2">principle originates from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.250" end="00:12:26.260" style="s2">a structure that we had known previously</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.890" end="00:12:28.810" style="s2">from the 1800&#39;s called Hamiltonian</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.260" end="00:12:32.949" style="s2">mechanics was actually a curved</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.810" end="00:12:36.640" style="s2">geometric system where the curvature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.949" end="00:12:38.860" style="s2">the system results in paradoxes because</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.640" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of you had a flat earth</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.860" end="00:12:44.110" style="s2">style expectation and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:47.649" style="s2">encountered curvature like the triangle</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.110" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">with 90 degrees on every angle now</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.649" end="00:12:52.029" style="s2">that&#39;s not supposed to happen that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:53.980" style="s2">can have a triangle that&#39;s 90 90 90 but</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.029" end="00:12:56.050" style="s2">you can on the surface of a sphere if</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.980" end="00:12:57.910" style="s2">you bent a triangle around a sphere or</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.050" end="00:12:59.110" style="s2">if you call it a curved linear triangle</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.910" end="00:13:01.560" style="s2">on a sphere and you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.110" end="00:13:03.970" style="s2">spherical geometry it&#39;s a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.560" end="00:13:07.149" style="s2">triangle not just a bent one so in other</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.970" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">words implicitly your intuition pump had</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.149" end="00:13:11.769" style="s2">come from flat space you didn&#39;t make an</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:15.610" style="s2">adaptation when it became part of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.769" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">curved system and the curvature gave you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.610" end="00:13:18.610" style="s2">the idea that something impossible was</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:19.660" style="s2">happening which is that you could have</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.660" end="00:13:25.180" style="s2">of them 90 degrees well it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.600" end="00:13:27.430" style="s2">that you it may be that the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.180" end="00:13:28.860" style="s2">failure to the to the ability which you</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">really until let&#39;s say that around the</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.710" end="00:14:41.290" style="s2">for the course um I have a feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.440" end="00:14:42.790" style="s2">when you say curvature that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.290" end="00:14:44.620" style="s2">what you mean because I&#39;m very tempted</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.790" end="00:14:45.820" style="s2">to take it more literally than I should</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.620" end="00:14:47.410" style="s2">and that it&#39;s almost like literal</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.820" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">literal curvature but that there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.410" end="00:14:51.580" style="s2">in which it&#39;s more metaphorical than</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.790" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">that but let me ask you just to check on</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.580" end="00:14:59.140" style="s2">whether I got what you said at all sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:15:02.140" style="s2">if Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.140" end="00:15:06.700" style="s2">result of curvature rather than actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.140" end="00:15:09.730" style="s2">uncertainty in linear space mm-hmm on 3d</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.700" end="00:15:11.590" style="s2">space then you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:14.890" style="s2">deterministic universe in which the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.590" end="00:15:16.840" style="s2">appearance of uncertainty would be there</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.890" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">but it would not actually be uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.840" end="00:15:22.030" style="s2">as a result of the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:23.560" style="s2">coming from curvature well so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.030" end="00:15:25.750" style="s2">even where the uncertainty comes from</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.560" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">really it should be Kaizen bergs non</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.750" end="00:15:31.210" style="s2">commutativity relationship rather than</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:33.150" style="s2">as an uncertainty principle so in part</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.210" end="00:15:35.100" style="s2">the Linguistics have gotten us very</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.150" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">fouled up so I&#39;ve made the case on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.100" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">recent essay on my own podcast the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:42.690" style="s2">portal which I begin each episode now</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.350" end="00:15:45.930" style="s2">with an audio essay by the way those</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:46.980" style="s2">audio essays are fantastic really I</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.930" end="00:15:48.180" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve heard every one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.980" end="00:15:51.650" style="s2">them I think I might have to really</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.180" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">appreciate every one I&#39;ve heard spot on</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.650" end="00:15:57.780" style="s2">brain isn&#39;t brilliantly written I really</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.060" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">appreciate that thank you makes me</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.780" end="00:16:02.760" style="s2">wonder what you&#39;re setting me up for</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:05.310" style="s2">later ah you&#39;ll see okay what what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.760" end="00:16:07.110" style="s2">would say is is that in this recent</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.310" end="00:16:10.530" style="s2">essay I had to make the point which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.110" end="00:16:14.280" style="s2">very tough on people that classical</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.530" end="00:16:17.550" style="s2">mechanics is deterministic in one sector</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.280" end="00:16:20.040" style="s2">and that sector when it becomes quantum</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.550" end="00:16:25.800" style="s2">mechanics is exactly as deterministic as</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.040" end="00:16:29.040" style="s2">classical mechanics like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.800" end="00:16:31.710" style="s2">uncertainty in quantum theory of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.040" end="00:16:33.720" style="s2">measurement occurs in a second sector</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.710" end="00:16:36.030" style="s2">where classical mechanics doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.720" end="00:16:37.770" style="s2">how to answer a problem and so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.030" end="00:16:39.990" style="s2">remains mute and you can&#39;t say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.770" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">deterministic or non-deterministic so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.990" end="00:16:47.370" style="s2">for example you know if I asked you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:50.220" style="s2">whether you&#39;re wearing are you either a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.370" end="00:16:53.520" style="s2">wearing a bandanna or be wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.220" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">jacket that&#39;s a tough question in</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.520" end="00:16:59.070" style="s2">classical mechanics you&#39;d say not a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:17:02.190" style="s2">question yeah in quantum mechanics we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.070" end="00:17:03.780" style="s2">say well 50% of the time you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.190" end="00:17:05.850" style="s2">wearing a bandanna and the jacket will</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.780" end="00:17:07.470" style="s2">disappear and 50% of the time you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:08.790" style="s2">wearing a jacket and the bandanna will</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.470" end="00:17:10.290" style="s2">disappear well with respect to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.790" end="00:17:12.500" style="s2">question I feel like I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.290" end="00:17:14.820" style="s2">superposition but I&#39;m not enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.500" end="00:17:17.370" style="s2">you&#39;re in one of the best positions made</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.820" end="00:17:18.080" style="s2">wonderful okay yeah so that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.370" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.080" end="00:17:23.790" style="s2">nobody remarks upon which is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:26.700" style="s2">in the sector where we&#39;re asking what</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.790" end="00:17:29.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve called bad questions that is every</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.700" end="00:17:31.800" style="s2">question come in quantum theory comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.010" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">with an implicit multiple choice list if</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.800" end="00:17:38.550" style="s2">the answer is not on the multiple choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">list quantum mechanics just guesses and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.550" end="00:17:42.330" style="s2">a guess is according to some formula as</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:44.580" style="s2">to how likely it is to make every guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.330" end="00:17:46.390" style="s2">if it is on the list it always guesses</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.580" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.390" end="00:17:51.550" style="s2">it&#39;s completely deterministic and so by</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:53.560" style="s2">reef casting so I&#39;m trying to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.550" end="00:17:54.970" style="s2">the linguistic associations you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.560" end="00:17:56.560" style="s2">coming in with Heisenberg you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.970" end="00:17:58.360" style="s2">something there&#39;s a cat</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.560" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">something about a double snip you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.360" end="00:18:01.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t even figured out why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.350" end="00:18:05.530" style="s2">pissing me off yet okay here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.570" end="00:18:08.650" style="s2">I get the quantum weirdness thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.530" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">stared at it I get that fully embracing</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.650" end="00:18:12.430" style="s2">the fact that what I&#39;m understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:15.130" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly be right and yet it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.430" end="00:18:17.040" style="s2">that part it&#39;s not that I know what to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.130" end="00:18:20.050" style="s2">make of it but I know how to accept it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.040" end="00:18:22.780" style="s2">what I don&#39;t accept is that there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.050" end="00:18:26.170" style="s2">ambiguity between deterministic universe</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.780" end="00:18:28.900" style="s2">and not deterministic universe and so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.170" end="00:18:31.420" style="s2">guess my question is are you telling me</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.900" end="00:18:32.820" style="s2">that there is some wiggle between those</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.420" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">two because I feel like it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.820" end="00:18:38.290" style="s2">discrete that either there is some</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.190" end="00:18:40.810" style="s2">wiggle right there&#39;s some uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.290" end="00:18:43.090" style="s2">that comes somewhere and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.810" end="00:18:44.650" style="s2">appears to us to be somewhat uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.090" end="00:18:47.230" style="s2">is somehow bootstrapped up from that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.650" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">thing or it ain&#39;t and we are permanently</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.230" end="00:18:51.100" style="s2">billiard balls bouncing in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:54.310" style="s2">predictable way around a billiard table</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.100" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">and this is just some absurd obnoxious</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.310" end="00:19:02.380" style="s2">spectacle of the illusion of chance Wow</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:05.580" style="s2">well the part of the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.380" end="00:19:09.100" style="s2">you probably have an Einsteinian picture</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.580" end="00:19:10.810" style="s2">well no and a quantum mechanical in it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.100" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">like a but I think God does play dice I</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.640" end="00:19:21.430" style="s2">you have an intuition pump that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.560" end="00:19:23.770" style="s2">effectively says that the peculiarities</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.430" end="00:19:25.420" style="s2">of an aardvark or something are so</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.010" end="00:19:31.090" style="s2">is beyond preposterous</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.930" end="00:20:02.180" style="s2">question about what would</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.140" end="00:20:03.920" style="s2">be true if my most optimistic and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.180" end="00:20:06.410" style="s2">aggressive version of my theory were</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.920" end="00:20:09.290" style="s2">true cool I&#39;m gonna correct you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.410" end="00:20:12.530" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna hate this okay hey why why</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.290" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">am I doing this then there&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.530" end="00:20:17.300" style="s2">you say theory yeah and I believe you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:19.400" style="s2">are borrowing something now that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.300" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">going to rob you incredibly in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.400" end="00:20:27.260" style="s2">future and so I hate it but it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:31.070" style="s2">a if it&#39;s physics it&#39;s a hypothesis if</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.260" end="00:20:35.090" style="s2">it&#39;s math I guess it&#39;s a postulate but</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.070" end="00:20:36.500" style="s2">it can&#39;t be a theory yet okay I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.090" end="00:20:38.060" style="s2">want to get into that whatever that cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.500" end="00:20:40.600" style="s2">well we&#39;ll come back to it you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.060" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">putting a placeholder to escape a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.600" end="00:20:45.080" style="s2">difficulty that I can&#39;t yet see in 12</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:47.300" style="s2">dimension no no no no no all right what</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.080" end="00:20:48.770" style="s2">I want is when it becomes a theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.300" end="00:20:50.450" style="s2">because it is actually established</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.770" end="00:20:52.820" style="s2">something in the real world I want it to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.450" end="00:20:55.310" style="s2">pull away from all of the other crap</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.820" end="00:20:58.010" style="s2">okay okay and the word theory is the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.310" end="00:20:59.150" style="s2">that works in some fields and not in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.010" end="00:21:00.410" style="s2">others for some reason I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.150" end="00:21:02.810" style="s2">where you&#39;re headed but I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.410" end="00:21:05.450" style="s2">have you our happiness nary theory is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.810" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">theory because we have established that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.450" end="00:21:09.830" style="s2">it is true to some high degree through</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:11.420" style="s2">experiments and observations I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.830" end="00:21:12.950" style="s2">want to get into this dream theory isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.420" end="00:21:19.250" style="s2">a theory I would agree that string</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.950" end="00:21:21.890" style="s2">theory isn&#39;t a theory but I I&#39;m specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.250" end="00:21:24.560" style="s2">enough about what this thing is okay I</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.890" end="00:21:26.030" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t fear the word we will just</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.560" end="00:21:30.560" style="s2">put an asterisk just usually about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.030" end="00:21:33.920" style="s2">that&#39;s fine what I was gonna say is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.560" end="00:21:37.310" style="s2">that I don&#39;t buy into what you probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.920" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">believe about the world which is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.310" end="00:21:41.930" style="s2">think that right now you and I are in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:45.650" style="s2">three dimensions having a progressing</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.930" end="00:21:51.530" style="s2">conversation in a forth called time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.650" end="00:21:53.450" style="s2">so as a result of that one of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.530" end="00:21:55.430" style="s2">is that you have to go beyond Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.450" end="00:21:58.670" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to resolve certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.430" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">resolve if you&#39;re going to attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.670" end="00:22:02.390" style="s2">resolve any problems generated by</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">Einstein like black holes why are their</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.390" end="00:22:05.750" style="s2">singular solutions or the initial</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:08.060" style="s2">singularity which we sort of mapped to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.750" end="00:22:11.660" style="s2">the timer and the Big Bang or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.060" end="00:22:13.430" style="s2">like that those problems in my mind and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.660" end="00:22:15.410" style="s2">some others that I think are more</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.430" end="00:22:18.500" style="s2">significant and somehow people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.410" end="00:22:20.270" style="s2">care about which I find bizarre indicate</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.500" end="00:22:22.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s something beyond Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.270" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">and if there is something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.280" end="00:22:27.050" style="s2">Einstein you have to ask all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:29.330" style="s2">questions that I formulated inside of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.050" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">his world yeah do I know what their</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.330" end="00:22:34.970" style="s2">analog is in the larger structure so my</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:36.860" style="s2">guess is whenever I see the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.970" end="00:22:40.190" style="s2">ink spilled over something like quantum</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.860" end="00:22:41.510" style="s2">theory and indeterminacy and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.190" end="00:22:44.150" style="s2">and all those sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.510" end="00:22:44.990" style="s2">entanglement many worlds I immediately</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.150" end="00:22:46.010" style="s2">say Oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.990" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">sounds like people are in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.010" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">paradigm trying to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:50.930" style="s2">prematurely about what would be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:53.270" style="s2">in the next paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.930" end="00:22:55.130" style="s2">it&#39;s flatland you got Flatlanders you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.270" end="00:22:57.410" style="s2">got floating around trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.130" end="00:22:59.900" style="s2">higher dimensions would be one problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.410" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">and curvature which would be another</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.900" end="00:23:03.830" style="s2">problem they can&#39;t figure out either of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:06.710" style="s2">these two and so the only reason for</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.830" end="00:23:09.830" style="s2">engaging in that stuff is usually to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.710" end="00:23:11.270" style="s2">break the paradigm or its recreation</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.830" end="00:23:12.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re not really serious so</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.270" end="00:23:13.910" style="s2">might as well have a half-hour</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.500" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">discussion about freewill</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.910" end="00:23:18.530" style="s2">ain&#39;t no interest it I&#39;ve been in those</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:20.330" style="s2">discussions they&#39;re not fun but before</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.530" end="00:23:21.920" style="s2">we laid them before we leave Einstein I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.330" end="00:23:23.480" style="s2">want to make my other point and see</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.920" end="00:23:27.770" style="s2">whether it lands or doesn&#39;t land with</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.480" end="00:23:30.710" style="s2">you so you say so let&#39;s first say</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:33.080" style="s2">sitting in three dimensions with time as</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.710" end="00:23:34.580" style="s2">a fourth dimension does not describe the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.080" end="00:23:36.590" style="s2">four dimensional manifold a four</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.580" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">dimensional manifold my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.590" end="00:23:40.250" style="s2">would be that that&#39;s actually a four</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:42.440" style="s2">dimensional shape and so a creature that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.250" end="00:23:44.180" style="s2">lives in this four dimensional shape but</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:45.020" style="s2">experiences one of the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.180" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.020" end="00:23:49.310" style="s2">the quirk is with the creature right the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">shape is four dimensional and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.310" end="00:23:54.830" style="s2">creature is you know has an accounting</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:58.850" style="s2">secesh I mean I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.830" end="00:24:01.510" style="s2">weirdness is that if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.850" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">as Gladys Knight and her three pips</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.510" end="00:24:07.250" style="s2">where time is Gladys and the pips are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:14.510" style="s2">spatial dimensions called XY and Z let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.250" end="00:24:17.350" style="s2">say that world is one in which time is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.510" end="00:24:19.580" style="s2">somewhat broken out as special yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.350" end="00:24:21.650" style="s2">somewhat not like you can trade off</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.580" end="00:24:25.000" style="s2">small amounts of time for some small</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.650" end="00:24:27.330" style="s2">amount of space but you can&#39;t treat time</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.000" end="00:24:29.460" style="s2">wholesale as space okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.330" end="00:24:31.140" style="s2">so there&#39;s a weird way in which time is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.460" end="00:24:33.000" style="s2">distinguished there&#39;s a weird way in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.140" end="00:24:34.830" style="s2">which time is one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.000" end="00:24:38.070" style="s2">Bands okay so this actually brings me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.830" end="00:24:40.920" style="s2">the point so first of all you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.070" end="00:24:43.650" style="s2">in some ways quite similar cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.920" end="00:24:46.710" style="s2">and in some ways we are opposites right</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.650" end="00:24:50.190" style="s2">I I believe that because you existed in</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.710" end="00:24:52.770" style="s2">the world I was born into I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.190" end="00:24:55.350" style="s2">moving in the direction of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.770" end="00:24:57.570" style="s2">that is biology and away from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.350" end="00:24:58.920" style="s2">ultimate fundamentals and you often when</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.570" end="00:25:00.300" style="s2">I say something like this you correct me</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.920" end="00:25:01.530" style="s2">and you say yes you treat biology like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.300" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">fundamental though which is true if that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.530" end="00:25:06.270" style="s2">is that is what I did with it but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:07.560" style="s2">way I did that was but there a couple</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.270" end="00:25:10.350" style="s2">things that are true of biology that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.560" end="00:25:13.110" style="s2">make it dead simple compared to stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.350" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">that you&#39;re working on one of them is at</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.110" end="00:25:15.030" style="s2">the end of the day creatures have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:16.440" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.030" end="00:25:18.660" style="s2">right they don&#39;t have to make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.440" end="00:25:21.270" style="s2">you but they have to make sense in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.660" end="00:25:22.380" style="s2">meaningful way and so it&#39;s a simpler</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:24.180" style="s2">puzzle right</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.380" end="00:25:26.670" style="s2">we don&#39;t have quantum weirdness in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.180" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">biology because the creatures have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.670" end="00:25:31.260" style="s2">eat and they have to you know bring in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:34.860" style="s2">enough energy and all that the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.260" end="00:25:38.610" style="s2">thing is biology is much more tolerant</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.860" end="00:25:40.950" style="s2">of a kind of logical cheating you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.610" end="00:25:42.840" style="s2">get you can get used to where sloppiness</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.950" end="00:25:47.430" style="s2">is allowed and where it isn&#39;t and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.840" end="00:25:48.600" style="s2">can take advantage of the the tolerances</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.430" end="00:25:51.090" style="s2">that come from the places where</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.600" end="00:25:53.160" style="s2">sloppiness doesn&#39;t really hurt you one</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.090" end="00:25:55.350" style="s2">of the places that I&#39;ve found that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:59.300" style="s2">can be very sloppy in biology and make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.350" end="00:26:02.760" style="s2">ton of profit is with the following</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.300" end="00:26:05.400" style="s2">claim and anytime you see a pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.760" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">space there&#39;s another pattern in time</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.400" end="00:26:08.340" style="s2">that looks just like it and it probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:10.230" style="s2">goes by some other name and nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.340" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">noticed the relationship so you can kind</p>

<p begin="00:27:49.170" end="00:27:53.790" style="s2">interesting issue where people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.600" end="00:27:56.910" style="s2">notice that there is that which works</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.790" end="00:27:58.530" style="s2">across these reflections and changes a</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.530" end="00:28:02.580" style="s2">does not okay I completely lost what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.840" end="00:28:04.290" style="s2">were getting at when you had us</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.580" end="00:28:07.020" style="s2">transmuting into each other I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.290" end="00:28:08.760" style="s2">that for you want to compare your tastes</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.020" end="00:28:10.620" style="s2">and what whether you&#39;re better off in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.760" end="00:28:13.350" style="s2">future instant of time given that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.620" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2">changed your tastes over time yeah turns</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.350" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">out that we have a way of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:18.840" style="s2">where the field thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:21.720" style="s2">impossible if we want to compare a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.840" end="00:28:24.270" style="s2">of people&#39;s different tastes you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.720" end="00:28:25.860" style="s2">do that if you had a morphing of me into</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.270" end="00:28:27.690" style="s2">you you into somebody else somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.860" end="00:28:29.580" style="s2">into somebody else I see and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.690" end="00:28:31.620" style="s2">the idea is is that with an extra piece</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.580" end="00:28:33.300" style="s2">of data there would be a duality between</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.620" end="00:28:35.010" style="s2">time and space but even the great Ken</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.300" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">arrow arguably the greatest of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.010" end="00:28:40.820" style="s2">mathematical economists of modern times</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:43.020" style="s2">was fooled into thinking you Eric cannot</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.820" end="00:28:45.960" style="s2">possibly be telling me that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.020" end="00:28:47.850" style="s2">have solved the problem of intertemporal</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.960" end="00:28:52.170" style="s2">tastes because that would imply a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.850" end="00:28:53.790" style="s2">solution to inter agent taste comparison</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.170" end="00:28:54.600" style="s2">and I proved that that was impossible</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.790" end="00:28:56.340" style="s2">therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.600" end="00:28:57.660" style="s2">you do as impossible then I had to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.340" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">to him nope</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.660" end="00:29:01.350" style="s2">youuuu blown it you didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:03.480" style="s2">that there was an extra piece of data</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.350" end="00:29:07.320" style="s2">which made time different than space so</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.480" end="00:29:08.700" style="s2">am i right that this is a kludge the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.320" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">thing about occlude for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.700" end="00:29:13.169" style="s2">are not familiar with the term Cluj is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:16.740" style="s2">basically an engineering term where a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.169" end="00:29:19.169" style="s2">kludge is an elegant but highly</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.740" end="00:29:21.539" style="s2">functional solution what&#39;s what is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.169" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">kludge in this case in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.539" end="00:29:25.320" style="s2">fact that you can use that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:26.970" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody transmuting into anybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.320" end="00:29:28.710" style="s2">else but if you treat somebody as</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.970" end="00:29:30.030" style="s2">transmuting into somebody else you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.710" end="00:29:31.830" style="s2">apparently solve a problem that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.030" end="00:29:34.409" style="s2">would be able but then the solution</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.830" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">would depend on the transmutation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.409" end="00:29:40.140" style="s2">since that&#39;s not real if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:41.490" style="s2">remove that dependence on that extra</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.140" end="00:29:44.400" style="s2">piece of structure that you&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.490" end="00:29:46.740" style="s2">invoked you know so yes the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.400" end="00:29:48.750" style="s2">I can solve the arrow impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.740" end="00:29:50.610" style="s2">theorem with an extra piece of data</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.750" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">which is a continuum that connects all</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.610" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">members of the society together does</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">that ever work out to be meaningful I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.340" end="00:30:01.830" style="s2">never seen a meaningful example of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:03.960" style="s2">okay so I think I am trying to riff and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.830" end="00:30:05.700" style="s2">play with you know yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.960" end="00:30:08.220" style="s2">good for one thing for one thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.700" end="00:30:09.659" style="s2">maybe the most important thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.220" end="00:30:12.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t know exactly who&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.659" end="00:30:15.750" style="s2">audience but I would imagine that just</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.600" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">simply discovering that with something</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.750" end="00:30:21.299" style="s2">you know two people who&#39;ve spent a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">lifetime exchanging information to speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.299" end="00:30:25.380" style="s2">each other&#39;s language and all that when</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:27.450" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a gap this big yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.380" end="00:30:29.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of like spinning your</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.450" end="00:30:31.620" style="s2">wheels and you scratching your head and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.309" end="00:30:33.870" style="s2">not knowing what&#39;s going on and that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.620" end="00:30:36.690" style="s2">does result in progress but you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.870" end="00:30:38.669" style="s2">being sort of empowered to say no I</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.690" end="00:30:40.289" style="s2">don&#39;t get that yet yeah probably for</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.669" end="00:30:41.400" style="s2">okay people who care about her what</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.289" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.400" end="00:30:48.809" style="s2">useful okay so if I get you so far</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.210" end="00:30:51.299" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s most people have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.809" end="00:30:53.100" style="s2">at the gap between three and four</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.299" end="00:30:56.220" style="s2">dimensions they&#39;re uneasy with what it</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.100" end="00:30:59.130" style="s2">means that time is a dimension in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.220" end="00:31:01.890" style="s2">sense analogous to the first three I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.130" end="00:31:03.720" style="s2">there I do that one pretty easily maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.890" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve got some sloppiness in my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.720" end="00:31:08.519" style="s2">about it but you&#39;re telling me that what</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.019" style="s2">I don&#39;t get is that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.519" end="00:31:11.219" style="s2">we&#39;re dimensional universe that I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.019" end="00:31:13.469" style="s2">of you know I&#39;ve taken off the training</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.219" end="00:31:15.809" style="s2">wheels but I&#39;m no expert in yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.469" end="00:31:18.719" style="s2">that thing is actually the training</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.809" end="00:31:20.369" style="s2">wheel land for a larger universe that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.719" end="00:31:24.209" style="s2">know from past things you said is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.369" end="00:31:26.369" style="s2">fourteen dimension yeah okay and so then</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.209" end="00:31:28.529" style="s2">I agree when you say you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.369" end="00:31:31.889" style="s2">fourteen dimensional I can say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.529" end="00:31:34.469" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s 14 bits or</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.889" end="00:31:36.379" style="s2">something right it&#39;s fourteen bit color</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.469" end="00:31:38.729" style="s2">or I don&#39;t know what I so I can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.379" end="00:31:40.440" style="s2">understand what it would mean to have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.729" end="00:31:42.389" style="s2">fourteen dimensional space but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.440" end="00:31:44.519" style="s2">understand how you would know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.389" end="00:31:46.529" style="s2">in one and what its implications might</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.519" end="00:31:47.820" style="s2">be well people get very hung up because</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.529" end="00:31:50.519" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand that not all</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.820" end="00:31:53.249" style="s2">dimensions or visual dimensions or</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.519" end="00:31:55.709" style="s2">spatial dimensions so for example very</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.249" end="00:31:58.879" style="s2">few people get upset when they buy a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.709" end="00:32:05.700" style="s2">piece of audio equipment and it says</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.879" end="00:32:07.709" style="s2">treble mid-range bass volume reverb okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.700" end="00:32:09.629" style="s2">well that&#39;s five dimensions to me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.709" end="00:32:11.609" style="s2">and then they&#39;re like well that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.629" end="00:32:12.989" style="s2">real dimension they&#39;re thinking and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.609" end="00:32:14.519" style="s2">saying okay well then I and now I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.989" end="00:32:16.440" style="s2">what your confusion is is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.519" end="00:32:18.570" style="s2">been told that dimensions are spatial or</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.440" end="00:32:20.099" style="s2">visual spatial dimensions and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.570" end="00:32:23.549" style="s2">gonna reject every number the distant</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.099" end="00:32:25.169" style="s2">three yep okay so I&#39;m gonna say well it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.549" end="00:32:27.629" style="s2">seems to me like when you eat when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.169" end="00:32:33.059" style="s2">order food you&#39;re thinking about sweet</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.629" end="00:32:36.629" style="s2">salty bitter sour pain for you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.059" end="00:32:37.950" style="s2">those chili peppers and heat that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.629" end="00:32:39.539" style="s2">there&#39;s six dimensions going on your</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.950" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">tongue before I even get started and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.539" end="00:32:44.639" style="s2">you&#39;re not freaked out that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:46.139" style="s2">six dimensions worth of taste and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.639" end="00:32:47.759" style="s2">only problem is is that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.139" end="00:32:49.169" style="s2">cram those into your visual court well</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.759" end="00:32:52.409" style="s2">how can I see them well you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.169" end="00:32:54.899" style="s2">those tastes either you taste them so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.409" end="00:32:57.169" style="s2">you know your your mouth is at least six</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.899" end="00:33:00.329" style="s2">dimensional based on what we just said</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.169" end="00:33:02.129" style="s2">now it&#39;s very important that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.329" end="00:33:04.759" style="s2">understand that you&#39;re not dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.129" end="00:33:07.409" style="s2">super minds or like just a second breath</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.759" end="00:33:08.849" style="s2">I&#39;m going to see the 14th dimension no</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.409" end="00:33:11.249" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it because you&#39;re a mere</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.849" end="00:33:13.649" style="s2">mortal but I your older brother I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.249" end="00:33:15.379" style="s2">seen farther than other men yes all</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.649" end="00:33:18.149" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.379" end="00:33:20.249" style="s2">so okay you are solving a problem here</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.149" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">for me so terrific when you say so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.249" end="00:33:24.210" style="s2">think I&#39;m being misled</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:25.890" style="s2">by my experience which is the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.210" end="00:33:30.299" style="s2">three dimensions are similar to each</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.890" end="00:33:34.340" style="s2">other the fourth dimension is unique</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.299" end="00:33:36.840" style="s2">feeling but parallel in some sense to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.340" end="00:33:38.610" style="s2">the spatial dimensions or maybe the one</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.840" end="00:33:40.049" style="s2">dimension of time is parallel to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.610" end="00:33:41.580" style="s2">three dimensions of space or something</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.049" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">like that and so I have the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.580" end="00:33:46.230" style="s2">like oh this isn&#39;t getting easier as we</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:48.210" style="s2">add dimensions this is getting weirder</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.230" end="00:33:49.799" style="s2">and more complex and what you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.210" end="00:33:51.270" style="s2">me is that it may be that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.799" end="00:33:54.539" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s above the level that I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.270" end="00:33:58.429" style="s2">conceptualize it our simple bit flips or</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.539" end="00:34:00.690" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t you know add</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.429" end="00:34:02.070" style="s2">indefinitely large amounts of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.690" end="00:34:03.899" style="s2">but you need to be aware of them or else</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.070" end="00:34:05.970" style="s2">everything everything but we could do</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.899" end="00:34:08.460" style="s2">the whole thing visually so for example</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.970" end="00:34:10.379" style="s2">for those of those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.460" end="00:34:13.070" style="s2">watching this rather than listening to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.379" end="00:34:16.290" style="s2">this I&#39;m now holding my glass of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.070" end="00:34:20.760" style="s2">recently drained kombucha and the rim of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:24.659" style="s2">it seems to be close to a circle now if</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.760" end="00:34:28.770" style="s2">space were just one space time or just</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.659" end="00:34:33.960" style="s2">one circular dimension yeah then I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:38.339" style="s2">claim that the enlarged structure so in</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.960" end="00:34:40.200" style="s2">my theory four becomes 14 the one</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.339" end="00:34:41.790" style="s2">dimension that is the one parameter</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.200" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">people will think a circle is two</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.790" end="00:34:44.730" style="s2">dimension again it lives in two</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:46.589" style="s2">dimension yeah but because there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.730" end="00:34:47.639" style="s2">one to give me you know only need one</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.589" end="00:34:49.530" style="s2">number to say where you are on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.639" end="00:34:54.619" style="s2">circle just give me the angle yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.530" end="00:34:57.420" style="s2">that circle would generate something of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.619" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">the one original dimension plus one</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.420" end="00:35:03.420" style="s2">dimension which for me would be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:06.599" style="s2">measure length at every point on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.420" end="00:35:09.930" style="s2">circle so a different ruler to measure</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.599" end="00:35:11.460" style="s2">length so we don&#39;t get this yet there</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.930" end="00:35:13.080" style="s2">are an infinite number of points around</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.460" end="00:35:14.910" style="s2">that circle tonight the circle is</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.080" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">infinitely divisible you&#39;re saying you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.910" end="00:35:19.080" style="s2">want a different ruler for each so as</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:21.150" style="s2">finely as I divide you want a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.080" end="00:35:24.690" style="s2">ruler for each point I want a rule that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.150" end="00:35:27.630" style="s2">tells me how to measure length on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.690" end="00:35:29.550" style="s2">line tangent to that circle at any given</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.630" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">point ok so EV of a there an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.550" end="00:35:33.210" style="s2">number of tangents to the circle if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.440" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">want to measure how much of a line</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.210" end="00:35:35.740" style="s2">segment you have you want a ruler that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:38.350" style="s2">allows I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.740" end="00:35:40.210" style="s2">line at every point okay tangent to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.350" end="00:35:42.910" style="s2">circle yeah and then I want a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.210" end="00:35:45.940" style="s2">ruler a rule that tells me how I can</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.910" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">measure distance along that line where</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.940" end="00:35:50.500" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to all come from one</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:52.990" style="s2">ruler that I place at every point why</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.500" end="00:35:54.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing is throwing seems like</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.990" end="00:35:56.500" style="s2">one ruler that you can just tell it</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.820" end="00:35:58.060" style="s2">where to measure is good enough why</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.500" end="00:35:59.500" style="s2">would you want a special one for each</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.060" end="00:36:01.750" style="s2">tangent well because you&#39;re borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.500" end="00:36:04.900" style="s2">the fact that that this glass is living</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.750" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">in three dimensional space okay and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.900" end="00:36:08.230" style="s2">because of that and because three</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.940" style="s2">dimensional space seems to have one</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.230" end="00:36:11.650" style="s2">ruler right like you don&#39;t buy a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.940" end="00:36:13.810" style="s2">different ruler for your ex to rent</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.650" end="00:36:16.090" style="s2">dimensions your Y your Z so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.810" end="00:36:18.550" style="s2">you go off to Amazon or the local</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.090" end="00:36:19.869" style="s2">hardware store you buy a ruler and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.550" end="00:36:21.340" style="s2">ruler is living in three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.869" end="00:36:22.810" style="s2">space now I give you a problem you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.340" end="00:36:24.430" style="s2">like I&#39;ll Cal go I&#39;ll just go get my one</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.810" end="00:36:25.410" style="s2">great ruler yeah and I&#39;m gonna measure</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.430" end="00:36:28.540" style="s2">at every point</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.410" end="00:36:32.110" style="s2">well this circle in my story is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.540" end="00:36:33.940" style="s2">analog of space-time before it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.110" end="00:36:36.030" style="s2">become space-time so call it proto</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.940" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">spacetime because what Einstein did</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.030" end="00:36:41.020" style="s2">effectively let&#39;s just make it weird he</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.460" end="00:36:43.930" style="s2">said take the four dimensions of taste</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.020" end="00:36:46.270" style="s2">on your tongue sweet salty sour and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.930" end="00:36:48.609" style="s2">bitter come up with a different</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.270" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">intensity scale for each of those things</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.609" end="00:36:56.950" style="s2">call that a ruler and then come up with</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">angles between them ah what how do I</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.950" end="00:37:01.420" style="s2">know whether sweet is very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.260" end="00:37:03.580" style="s2">sour because sweet and sour go well</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.420" end="00:37:05.500" style="s2">together or is it really that it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.580" end="00:37:07.300" style="s2">of opposite so is it some kind of Delta</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.500" end="00:37:09.880" style="s2">between the experiences right how</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.300" end="00:37:11.830" style="s2">different is sweetness we don&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.880" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to invent a world which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.830" end="00:37:15.220" style="s2">the three-dimensional world in which you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:17.080" style="s2">and I seem to be you&#39;re trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.220" end="00:37:19.150" style="s2">an analog world and of course I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.080" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">to build you an intuition pump so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.150" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">idea is that your visual cortex in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:25.240" style="s2">back of your head since we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.210" end="00:37:29.260" style="s2">biology yeah is a huge hindrance to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.240" end="00:37:30.820" style="s2">yeah and that huge hindrance is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.260" end="00:37:32.619" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna map everything back to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.820" end="00:37:34.240" style="s2">and since everything came with rulers</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.619" end="00:37:36.869" style="s2">and protractors and you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.240" end="00:37:39.430" style="s2">be able to think about a world before</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.869" end="00:37:42.910" style="s2">rulers and protractors and since</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.430" end="00:37:44.410" style="s2">Einstein&#39;s principle insight with</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.910" end="00:37:47.470" style="s2">Grossman I might add this is before</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.410" end="00:37:48.980" style="s2">Einstein breaks out into GR as most</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.470" end="00:37:52.430" style="s2">physicists now think about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.980" end="00:37:54.290" style="s2">was to say I bet that the geometry that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.430" end="00:37:56.119" style="s2">we call differential geometry or romani</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.290" end="00:37:58.099" style="s2">and geometry or semi remaining or pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.119" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">Roman whatever this kind of geometry was</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.099" end="00:38:04.430" style="s2">that came up in Germany way back when</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:07.339" style="s2">this geometry is the right way to model</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:10.099" style="s2">our universe but your universe contains</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.339" end="00:38:11.210" style="s2">the geometric assumptions already so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.099" end="00:38:12.680" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of saying like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.210" end="00:38:14.420" style="s2">understand what did he do doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.680" end="00:38:16.970" style="s2">like much so I&#39;m trying to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.420" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about your tongue we know for</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.970" end="00:38:22.070" style="s2">example that there&#39;s like a Scoville</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:24.260" style="s2">scale for pain for peppers mm-hmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.070" end="00:38:26.030" style="s2">that&#39;s weird it&#39;s a ruler that&#39;s a ruler</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.260" end="00:38:28.369" style="s2">to tell you how how intense</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.030" end="00:38:30.140" style="s2">okay my guess is the people who make</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.369" end="00:38:33.500" style="s2">artificial sweetners probably have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.140" end="00:38:35.540" style="s2">sweetness scale yeah and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.500" end="00:38:38.839" style="s2">how the sweetness scale and the pain</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.540" end="00:38:41.480" style="s2">scale interact like are those the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.839" end="00:38:43.250" style="s2">ruler was there any thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.480" end="00:38:45.530" style="s2">intensity to make sure that it&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.250" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">between the resep receptors like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.530" end="00:38:50.030" style="s2">know what is their threshold to get your</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.410" style="s2">attention maybe the idea is below a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.030" end="00:38:52.970" style="s2">certain threshold you don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.410" end="00:38:54.920" style="s2">get your attention it yeah you call that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.970" end="00:38:57.410" style="s2">one now you&#39;ve normalized your rulers</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.920" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">across all of the different tastes my</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.410" end="00:39:01.369" style="s2">point in this is when it comes to pure</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:03.740" style="s2">taste forget pain and forget heat for</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.369" end="00:39:07.180" style="s2">the moment yeah you&#39;ve got four major</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.740" end="00:39:09.950" style="s2">kinds of receptor that we know about</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.180" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">those four receptors are like proto</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.950" end="00:39:14.569" style="s2">space-time it&#39;s like Einstein before he</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.530" end="00:39:16.310" style="s2">puts the metric which is the rulers and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.569" end="00:39:18.589" style="s2">protractors on the thing that we call</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.310" end="00:39:20.869" style="s2">space-time you and I are inheriting</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.589" end="00:39:23.960" style="s2">rulers and protractors from Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.869" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">spacetime okay so I I get the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.960" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">pump problem okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:30.230" style="s2">I get the the analogy that&#39;s throwing me</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:31.970" style="s2">but I can correct for it with the tongue</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.230" end="00:39:34.130" style="s2">because obviously that&#39;s an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.970" end="00:39:35.390" style="s2">space and how intense the pain is has</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.130" end="00:39:37.099" style="s2">everything it&#39;s just four degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:39.140" style="s2">freedom that didn&#39;t come equipped with</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.099" end="00:39:40.040" style="s2">the thing that you&#39;re always gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.140" end="00:39:41.780" style="s2">like I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.040" end="00:39:43.609" style="s2">we have rollers and protractors just go</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.780" end="00:39:46.099" style="s2">out and get one and measure stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.609" end="00:39:48.109" style="s2">the idea is okay well on your tongue you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.099" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">don&#39;t have that so when you say rulers</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.109" end="00:39:52.940" style="s2">and protractors yep this is I&#39;m I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.430" style="s2">know if this is right but I&#39;m asking you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.940" end="00:39:57.890" style="s2">you are saying there are two different</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.430" end="00:40:00.619" style="s2">kinds of Delta where you want to measure</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.890" end="00:40:02.510" style="s2">the difference between two things</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.619" end="00:40:02.870" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;re talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.510" end="00:40:05.420" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.870" end="00:40:06.830" style="s2">to a length than your ruler sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.420" end="00:40:09.260" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.830" end="00:40:12.710" style="s2">you know an angle difference you want a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.260" end="00:40:16.610" style="s2">protractor okay what I don&#39;t get is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.710" end="00:40:18.320" style="s2">length and angle are analogized to I</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.610" end="00:40:20.660" style="s2">know how Lane I know how lanes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.320" end="00:40:23.750" style="s2">angles work but I don&#39;t know well we</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.660" end="00:40:28.730" style="s2">would say in in in grownup math land is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.750" end="00:40:31.730" style="s2">Oh at every point you need a metric</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.730" end="00:40:33.530" style="s2">which is a symmetric non-degenerate two</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.730" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">tensor that&#39;s a bunch of language but</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.530" end="00:40:39.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve read it again slower there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:41.720" style="s2">gadget which is effectively a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.020" end="00:40:44.810" style="s2">combination ruler and protractor and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.720" end="00:40:47.180" style="s2">have to extract length style and angle</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.810" end="00:40:50.120" style="s2">style information from it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.180" end="00:40:54.230" style="s2">basically in four dimensions a four by</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.120" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">four matrix so 16 entries in which if</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.230" end="00:40:59.540" style="s2">you flip across the diagonal going from</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:41:01.910" style="s2">the Northwest to the southeast it has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.540" end="00:41:04.600" style="s2">be symmetric under a flip so once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.910" end="00:41:06.980" style="s2">got the top triangle of that diagram</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.600" end="00:41:09.410" style="s2">concentrated in the northeast corner and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.980" end="00:41:11.570" style="s2">you flip that into the southwest all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.410" end="00:41:13.640" style="s2">information is reflected from that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.570" end="00:41:15.770" style="s2">object I can get length and angle</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.640" end="00:41:18.080" style="s2">information so what when I whenever I</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.770" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">talk to lay audiences I don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.080" end="00:41:22.820" style="s2">symmetric non-degenerate to tensors you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:26.300" style="s2">do more than you think but much less</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.820" end="00:41:28.220" style="s2">than my colleagues I talk about oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.300" end="00:41:30.290" style="s2">just rulers and protractors and over and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.220" end="00:41:31.940" style="s2">over again you&#39;ll hear me talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.290" end="00:41:33.790" style="s2">rulers and protractors so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.940" end="00:41:37.640" style="s2">really talking about to a math audience</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.790" end="00:41:40.820" style="s2">is a four by four matrix at every point</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.640" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">in essence symmetric about its diagonal</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.820" end="00:41:45.950" style="s2">but the content of that is at least as</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:48.500" style="s2">far as Einstein was pushing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.950" end="00:41:50.540" style="s2">pushing it farther just ruler and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.500" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">protractor information and from that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.540" end="00:41:55.430" style="s2">turns out that curvature is in emergent</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">quantity which is kind of a giant shock</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.430" end="00:41:58.450" style="s2">we all sort of think we know what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:42:01.100" style="s2">mean by saying something is curved</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.450" end="00:42:02.870" style="s2">mathematicians figured out oh it turns</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.100" end="00:42:04.730" style="s2">out you can recover curvature as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.870" end="00:42:05.990" style="s2">consequence of just having rulers and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.730" end="00:42:09.080" style="s2">protractors with just a highly</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.990" end="00:42:14.050" style="s2">non-trivial observation yeah I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.080" end="00:42:16.250" style="s2">strikes me as hinted at by the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.050" end="00:42:19.160" style="s2">that both</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.250" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">the Greeks and the Chinese used to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.160" end="00:42:25.190" style="s2">figure out pi to sort of narrow in on pi</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:29.990" style="s2">right that basically what you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.190" end="00:42:36.470" style="s2">is non curved math to approximate what</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.990" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">happens as you get to curvature well we</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.470" end="00:42:41.390" style="s2">have a series of things that we do like</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:43.670" style="s2">the idea of a tangent vector when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.390" end="00:42:46.220" style="s2">have the rim of my glass and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.670" end="00:42:47.270" style="s2">about the line tangent to the glass you</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.220" end="00:42:48.920" style="s2">could say well if you don&#39;t put your</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.270" end="00:42:50.330" style="s2">glass inside of a three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.920" end="00:42:53.120" style="s2">world how do you know about the line</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.330" end="00:42:55.640" style="s2">tangent and mathematicians say ah we</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.120" end="00:42:58.130" style="s2">don&#39;t actually need to put the glass and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.640" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">its rim inside of a larger space we used</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.130" end="00:43:03.650" style="s2">to but now we learned how to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:05.210" style="s2">tangent see from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.650" end="00:43:08.840" style="s2">differential operators in Newton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.210" end="00:43:11.300" style="s2">calculus it&#39;s like okay so the analog</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.840" end="00:43:12.380" style="s2">the sorry the the concept that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.300" end="00:43:14.180" style="s2">learned about in high school is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.380" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">something having magnitude and direction</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.180" end="00:43:19.010" style="s2">yeah turns out to be a differential</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:20.750" style="s2">operator yep laughs I was just gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.010" end="00:43:22.610" style="s2">you about this yes is the reason that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.750" end="00:43:24.860" style="s2">are talking about rulers and protractors</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.610" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">because of their relationship to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.860" end="00:43:34.070" style="s2">vector well it&#39;s it is vectors that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:36.440" style="s2">are measuring to say what their length</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.070" end="00:43:39.560" style="s2">is and what their angle is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.440" end="00:43:42.080" style="s2">even the word length is a lie because</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.560" end="00:43:44.150" style="s2">there are nonzero vectors that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.080" end="00:43:47.090" style="s2">would agree that it&#39;s nonzero that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.150" end="00:43:49.010" style="s2">have nonzero length and then people said</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.090" end="00:43:51.590" style="s2">wait a minute you just blow my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.010" end="00:43:53.330" style="s2">Y is non zero length trebling sorry they</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.590" end="00:43:55.550" style="s2">would have zero length zero line so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.330" end="00:43:59.180" style="s2">have non zero vectors which have zero</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.550" end="00:44:01.430" style="s2">length because we took a word that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.180" end="00:44:03.290" style="s2">know very well and then we borrowed it</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.430" end="00:44:05.390" style="s2">someplace where you really don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.290" end="00:44:07.220" style="s2">any intuition at all and now I just you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.390" end="00:44:09.890" style="s2">know it&#39;s like blowing somebody&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.220" end="00:44:11.630" style="s2">at a Christmas party wait there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.890" end="00:44:14.750" style="s2">vectors that are not zero but they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.630" end="00:44:16.490" style="s2">zero length Wow tell me more well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.750" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">hundred percent having to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.490" end="00:44:21.590" style="s2">linguistic encoding of the word length</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:23.360" style="s2">it does not have to do I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.590" end="00:44:25.700" style="s2">obviously a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.360" end="00:44:27.140" style="s2">weirdness that happens at zero which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.700" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">not claiming that I&#39;m not claiming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.140" end="00:44:29.660" style="s2">not weird but it&#39;s not as weird as</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:32.420" style="s2">saying that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.660" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">zero object has zero length that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.420" end="00:44:36.950" style="s2">what physicists and math people do to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:38.210" style="s2">blow people&#39;s minds and get them</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.950" end="00:44:40.039" style="s2">interested in the subject and then we</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.210" end="00:44:41.960" style="s2">unblown your mind later by teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.039" end="00:44:44.690" style="s2">what we really meant so it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.960" end="00:44:46.490" style="s2">not my favorite way of getting people in</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.690" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">the door of math and physics so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.490" end="00:44:50.690" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re just goofing</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:52.339" style="s2">off here but you know I used to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.690" end="00:44:53.630" style="s2">not a good dancer but I did spend a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.339" end="00:44:54.650" style="s2">little time when I was in Latin America</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.630" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">we&#39;re good dancer</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.650" end="00:44:59.030" style="s2">around the time of your wedding that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:45:02.180" style="s2">okay but what I learned I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.030" end="00:45:04.010" style="s2">always mortified by dancing and what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.180" end="00:45:05.930" style="s2">learned that kind of you know was one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.010" end="00:45:07.670" style="s2">the few things that broke it loose from</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.930" end="00:45:09.799" style="s2">me was that it was very important that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.670" end="00:45:12.049" style="s2">you do something on every beat even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.799" end="00:45:14.569" style="s2">what you do is nothing right does Beth</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.049" end="00:45:16.809" style="s2">the formulation sort of allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.569" end="00:45:20.420" style="s2">think through it rather than you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.809" end="00:45:21.349" style="s2">hopping all over these beats and not</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.420" end="00:45:22.910" style="s2">knowing when you were supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.349" end="00:45:26.359" style="s2">what so anyway it sort of sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.910" end="00:45:29.030" style="s2">the same sort of thing that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.359" end="00:45:31.369" style="s2">some sort of nonzero object that has</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.030" end="00:45:33.859" style="s2">zero length you&#39;ve got something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.369" end="00:45:35.630" style="s2">agrees with the concept of length in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.859" end="00:45:37.400" style="s2">realm that you&#39;re familiar with it that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.630" end="00:45:39.589" style="s2">extends into a realm that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.400" end="00:45:41.900" style="s2">thought much about so if you extend the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.589" end="00:45:46.579" style="s2">word length you blow your own mind but</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.900" end="00:45:49.700" style="s2">if you were to say like something about</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.579" end="00:45:53.539" style="s2">the weight of a vector and I could say</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.700" end="00:45:59.270" style="s2">well this vector has weight zero but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.539" end="00:46:01.700" style="s2">is not zero itself right yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.270" end="00:46:03.529" style="s2">then the idea and use weight there</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.700" end="00:46:05.240" style="s2">because they&#39;re fully because you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.529" end="00:46:07.309" style="s2">get zero weight without having zero mass</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.240" end="00:46:09.109" style="s2">and so the first time you realize this</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.309" end="00:46:11.059" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s some level if I if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.109" end="00:46:14.210" style="s2">call it length which is to extend the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.059" end="00:46:15.589" style="s2">word that you already knew yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.210" end="00:46:17.990" style="s2">you&#39;ll have the wrong intuition so what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.589" end="00:46:21.079" style="s2">I did was I cleverly sort of misdirected</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.990" end="00:46:22.970" style="s2">you as a magician into wrong intuition</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.079" end="00:46:24.619" style="s2">and that caused your mind to explode and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.970" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">that then I get to go home saying well</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.619" end="00:46:27.529" style="s2">I&#39;m smarter than he is and I hate that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:31.539" style="s2">game yeah I don&#39;t like that game either</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.529" end="00:46:33.950" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m also I like the game of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.539" end="00:46:35.869" style="s2">where&#39;s my intuition misleading me</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.950" end="00:46:38.750" style="s2">yep that&#39;s a you know so this also this</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.869" end="00:46:40.579" style="s2">is partially when I&#39;m not trying when</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.750" end="00:46:42.920" style="s2">I&#39;m not pretending as an impostor to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.579" end="00:46:43.500" style="s2">physics research I&#39;m pretending as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.920" end="00:46:45.210" style="s2">impostor</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.500" end="00:46:47.610" style="s2">to be a pedagogue and to clear up</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.210" end="00:46:50.340" style="s2">people&#39;s confusions that are left by</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.610" end="00:46:51.870" style="s2">other physicists or mathematicians who</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.340" end="00:46:53.460" style="s2">are intentionally trying to blow</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.870" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">people&#39;s minds okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.460" end="00:46:57.600" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s a that&#39;s because I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.890" end="00:46:59.450" style="s2">rather blow your mind in an honest way</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.600" end="00:47:03.030" style="s2">that causes you to want to stay engaged</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.450" end="00:47:04.830" style="s2">rather than just say wow the universe</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.030" end="00:47:06.060" style="s2">can fit inside of my fingernails</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.830" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">you would rather blow our minds</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.060" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">consequentially rather than by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:13.410" style="s2">the fact that something sounds amazing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:16.380" style="s2">yeah yeah okay good</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.410" end="00:47:18.540" style="s2">so all right there&#39;s some sort of 14</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.380" end="00:47:20.520" style="s2">dimensional space you&#39;ve let me just say</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.540" end="00:47:22.650" style="s2">a little word about that okay imagine</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.520" end="00:47:25.890" style="s2">that your proto space-time was like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.650" end="00:47:29.640" style="s2">infinitely thin hair band okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.890" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">hair band like Aerosmith or I would have</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.640" end="00:47:33.810" style="s2">gone with poison but anyway all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:35.400" style="s2">I think Aerosmith is more timeless but</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.810" end="00:47:41.670" style="s2">let&#39;s keep on least everybody&#39;s heard</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.400" end="00:47:43.560" style="s2">all right so I would say that if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.670" end="00:47:46.950" style="s2">started off with an infinitely thin hair</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.560" end="00:47:49.650" style="s2">band then for every point on that hair</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.950" end="00:47:51.840" style="s2">band imagine this space of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:55.500" style="s2">things that you went call of unit length</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.840" end="00:47:57.660" style="s2">all possible rulers okay and allow that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.500" end="00:47:59.700" style="s2">a ruler can be either marked with</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.660" end="00:48:02.310" style="s2">positive numbers or negative numbers for</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.700" end="00:48:04.610" style="s2">whatever reason yeah but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.310" end="00:48:06.900" style="s2">allowed to choose the zero ruler</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.610" end="00:48:08.970" style="s2">there&#39;s no way in which you can claim</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.900" end="00:48:11.370" style="s2">that everything is of zero length or</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.970" end="00:48:13.470" style="s2">infinite length I don&#39;t understand what</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.370" end="00:48:15.870" style="s2">a zero ruler would be let&#39;s not worry</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.470" end="00:48:18.150" style="s2">too much about it okay what I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.870" end="00:48:20.580" style="s2">claim is that the object that I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.150" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">create if I did the same thing which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.580" end="00:48:27.810" style="s2">doing to four dimensions turning it into</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.770" end="00:48:32.130" style="s2">14 would turn the hairband into two</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.810" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">toilet paper cores the cardboard cores</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.130" end="00:48:38.310" style="s2">would be two disconnected cylinders and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:39.960" style="s2">you can see that the circular nature of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.310" end="00:48:43.140" style="s2">the hairband would be represented in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.960" end="00:48:44.850" style="s2">circular nature okay so I get so you get</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.140" end="00:48:46.260" style="s2">it you take AB and let&#39;s imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.850" end="00:48:48.990" style="s2">this was done on the computer screen</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.260" end="00:48:51.990" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got a circle right this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.990" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">a hairband of no dimension right and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.990" end="00:48:56.490" style="s2">stretch it across something that gives</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.710" style="s2">you a tube well what I would say is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.490" end="00:49:01.289" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.710" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">along that tube is every possible going</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.289" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">lengthwise down the tube is every</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">possible ruler with the same sign so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:08.789" style="s2">reason you have to high is because</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:09.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive in a negative there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.789" end="00:49:11.549" style="s2">a positive in the negative that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.960" end="00:49:14.430" style="s2">you have to do so effectively you took a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.549" end="00:49:16.410" style="s2">long tube you cut a middle part of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.430" end="00:49:20.009" style="s2">tube out because those that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.410" end="00:49:23.579" style="s2">degenerate metrics so as this you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.009" end="00:49:27.869" style="s2">have one tube that goes from positive</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.579" end="00:49:30.630" style="s2">through negative because of a divided by</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.869" end="00:49:33.930" style="s2">0 problem you can&#39;t have that because</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.630" end="00:49:39.630" style="s2">then you would say that there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.930" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">directions which can&#39;t be measured as</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.630" end="00:49:45.109" style="s2">having a nonzero weight if you will or</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:48.119" style="s2">length or whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.109" end="00:49:50.670" style="s2">relative to every possible thing so</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.119" end="00:49:53.009" style="s2">every possible measurement could yield</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.670" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">zero if you choose a degenerate</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.009" end="00:50:00.029" style="s2">symmetric - tensor so remember some</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:03.480" style="s2">things can only serve as rulers and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.029" end="00:50:05.849" style="s2">protractors if they aren&#39;t pathological</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.480" end="00:50:08.880" style="s2">so all we&#39;re doing is getting rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.849" end="00:50:10.799" style="s2">stuff that is pathological and saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.880" end="00:50:13.950" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that there was a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.799" end="00:50:15.420" style="s2">fly in your soup sir we&#39;ve removed all</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.950" end="00:50:17.640" style="s2">the Flies from you I still want to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.420" end="00:50:20.190" style="s2">when you say pathological zero is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.640" end="00:50:22.170" style="s2">weirdly pathological you know there you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.190" end="00:50:25.319" style="s2">can&#39;t divide by zero or you&#39;ll blow your</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.170" end="00:50:27.809" style="s2">computer up right so there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.319" end="00:50:30.839" style="s2">with zero that doesn&#39;t tell you anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.809" end="00:50:32.999" style="s2">about immediately adjacent so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.839" end="00:50:34.829" style="s2">know of any way of handling the case</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.999" end="00:50:36.869" style="s2">where the rulers and protractors are</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.829" end="00:50:38.819" style="s2">effectively going to return zero for</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.869" end="00:50:40.710" style="s2">certain directions in all circles so</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.819" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">you&#39;re better off just saying look we</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.710" end="00:50:43.739" style="s2">can deal with this toilet paper tube and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:45.450" style="s2">we can deal with that that toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.739" end="00:50:47.789" style="s2">tube and they know it connect but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.450" end="00:50:51.059" style="s2">okay because yeah okay got it so now if</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.789" end="00:50:54.059" style="s2">we if we took the hair band and then we</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.059" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">said you know what let&#39;s let&#39;s up our</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.059" end="00:50:57.059" style="s2">game a little bit because the hairband</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t there&#39;s no space it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.059" end="00:51:00.869" style="s2">all space or all time depending upon</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.680" end="00:51:02.339" style="s2">whether you chose the plus rulers or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.869" end="00:51:05.730" style="s2">minus rule is if you chose the minus</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.339" end="00:51:07.769" style="s2">rulers it&#39;s all time if you chose the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.730" end="00:51:10.770" style="s2">plus rulers it&#39;s all space okay wait</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.769" end="00:51:15.400" style="s2">you&#39;re blowing my mind stop it</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.770" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">why would the sign is that arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.400" end="00:51:19.270" style="s2">that sort of okay so in other words it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:20.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell you that space should be</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.270" end="00:51:22.570" style="s2">plus and that time should be minus and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.770" end="00:51:25.000" style="s2">because you I need some way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.570" end="00:51:26.530" style="s2">distinguishing some time from some space</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.000" end="00:51:29.260" style="s2">and if you want to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.530" end="00:51:32.140" style="s2">backwards from my conventions feel free</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.260" end="00:51:33.850" style="s2">to call space negative and time positive</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.140" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">got it I believe that the we east coast</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.850" end="00:51:36.910" style="s2">in the west coast of the US chose</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.560" style="s2">different conventions in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.910" end="00:51:40.900" style="s2">university oh really I think there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.560" end="00:51:43.090" style="s2">East Room and there&#39;s a physics thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.900" end="00:51:44.050" style="s2">mathematicians almost never we know</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.090" end="00:51:47.110" style="s2">about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.050" end="00:51:48.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s not our lifeblood in general we</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.110" end="00:51:52.990" style="s2">prefer everything to be all pust all</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.760" end="00:51:55.180" style="s2">plus or all negative right we would call</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.990" end="00:51:56.830" style="s2">that Romani in geometry we know about</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.180" end="00:51:58.420" style="s2">semi Romani and geometry is just not</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.830" end="00:52:00.100" style="s2">very important to us it happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.420" end="00:52:02.890" style="s2">one case of geometry that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.100" end="00:52:05.320" style="s2">important in the outside world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.890" end="00:52:06.760" style="s2">mixed because it&#39;s one time and three</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.320" end="00:52:08.410" style="s2">space so are you telling me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.760" end="00:52:11.110" style="s2">mathematicians are forced into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.410" end="00:52:12.730" style="s2">landscape of half plus and half minus</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.110" end="00:52:14.500" style="s2">and when you want to talk about general</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.730" end="00:52:17.470" style="s2">relativity and we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.500" end="00:52:19.900" style="s2">physics we know that the case that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.470" end="00:52:22.600" style="s2">don&#39;t like which is mixed signature yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.900" end="00:52:26.890" style="s2">is the one that is physically relevant</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.600" end="00:52:28.630" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of perverse that we would</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.890" end="00:52:30.790" style="s2">prefer to be in what would be called</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.630" end="00:52:33.610" style="s2">Euclidean signature that is all plus or</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.790" end="00:52:36.310" style="s2">all - yeah and that&#39;s where we do our</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.610" end="00:52:38.470" style="s2">geometry but our physicist friends the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.310" end="00:52:43.540" style="s2">one case that they really like is this</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.470" end="00:52:46.600" style="s2">mixed signature case ok so is it that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.540" end="00:52:49.810" style="s2">they are bringing this stuff to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.600" end="00:52:51.970" style="s2">table that forces you into their zone we</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.810" end="00:52:55.300" style="s2">came up with an abstraction yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.970" end="00:52:57.580" style="s2">they applied it in one case so our</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.300" end="00:53:00.730" style="s2">imagine you&#39;re a software company yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.580" end="00:53:03.430" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t correctly anticipate who</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.730" end="00:53:04.870" style="s2">would want to run your software so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.430" end="00:53:07.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve got one amazing government</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.870" end="00:53:09.550" style="s2">contract let&#39;s imagine yeah and it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.510" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2">a use that you never imagined would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.550" end="00:53:13.620" style="s2">your leading use case like somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:16.120" style="s2">got a weird use of your product and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.620" end="00:53:18.430" style="s2">that&#39;s your only client so your only</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.120" end="00:53:21.490" style="s2">client outside of your pure shop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.430" end="00:53:23.440" style="s2">keeping you afloat is in the one case</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.490" end="00:53:23.950" style="s2">that your engineers don&#39;t like working</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.440" end="00:53:25.540" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.950" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">but if we could just suspend the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.540" end="00:53:29.619" style="s2">physicists yeah and you could translate</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">this all into plus or minus it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.619" end="00:53:33.160" style="s2">that the universe we&#39;d still do it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:36.250" style="s2">it would be done in some obscure</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.160" end="00:53:39.190" style="s2">department very often what happens is is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.250" end="00:53:42.040" style="s2">that if you have a special case somebody</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.190" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">who&#39;s not at the center of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.040" end="00:53:45.130" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have the ability to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:47.140" style="s2">constantly check in with what happened</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.130" end="00:53:49.089" style="s2">this week yeah we&#39;ll take it over so</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.140" end="00:53:51.369" style="s2">like you&#39;ll have a Uruguay community</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.089" end="00:53:53.020" style="s2">that cares about some special thing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.369" end="00:53:58.300" style="s2">it&#39;s great at some level because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.020" end="00:53:59.770" style="s2">means that somebody makes some important</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.300" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">case their life&#39;s work it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.770" end="00:54:04.030" style="s2">you&#39;re the guy who&#39;s in charge of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:05.950" style="s2">platypus you have to really know your</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.030" end="00:54:07.540" style="s2">stuff on that one system but that system</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.950" end="00:54:10.300" style="s2">is so different than everything else</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.540" end="00:54:11.950" style="s2">that maybe you know you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.300" end="00:54:14.020" style="s2">generalist ya know it removes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.950" end="00:54:15.849" style="s2">cognitive burden from those who have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.020" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">juggle a bunch of things which would</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.849" end="00:54:19.869" style="s2">otherwise be and there&#39;s some dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:23.349" style="s2">because you know quite honestly the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.869" end="00:54:25.859" style="s2">platypus is more important than just as</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.349" end="00:54:28.569" style="s2">an exception because it actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.859" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">huge thing to say about mammalian</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.569" end="00:54:33.790" style="s2">evolution so in this case I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:36.430" style="s2">turns out that the physics community</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.790" end="00:54:38.470" style="s2">keeps us interested in a class of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.430" end="00:54:41.319" style="s2">equations called hyperbolic equations</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.470" end="00:54:43.180" style="s2">that are really important that maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.319" end="00:54:45.700" style="s2">would discount and we&#39;d stay in the case</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.180" end="00:54:48.400" style="s2">of what we&#39;d call elliptic equations so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.700" end="00:54:52.210" style="s2">this happens I don&#39;t know why it comes</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.400" end="00:54:56.500" style="s2">to mind but in biology this happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.210" end="00:54:58.630" style="s2">around mites so mites are of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.500" end="00:55:01.420" style="s2">everywhere crawling all over everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.630" end="00:55:03.490" style="s2">but they&#39;re in general very tiny and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.420" end="00:55:04.540" style="s2">most of us biologists just don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.490" end="00:55:06.490" style="s2">pay attention to the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.540" end="00:55:08.589" style="s2">there but the mite people are really</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.490" end="00:55:11.369" style="s2">interesting and they have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.589" end="00:55:14.099" style="s2">bent in fact Heather and I had a friend</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.369" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">George Hammond who used to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.099" end="00:55:19.540" style="s2">there&#39;d be some seminar on some plant</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:23.829" style="s2">dynamics he&#39;d say it&#39;s always a mite</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.540" end="00:55:26.290" style="s2">angle so anyway yeah mites are the zone</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.829" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">of special people who you know enter the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.290" end="00:55:29.950" style="s2">conversation when something turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:31.900" style="s2">determine to be dependent on this so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.950" end="00:55:34.750" style="s2">was gonna say well though is is that if</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.900" end="00:55:36.250" style="s2">you if you up the game and you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.750" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">now I want to play with two dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.250" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">so I have one time to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:42.470" style="s2">in one space dimension at least that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:45.110" style="s2">starts to sound like reality because</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.470" end="00:55:46.610" style="s2">space and time are different yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.110" end="00:55:50.600" style="s2">then you&#39;d be in a two dimensional world</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.610" end="00:55:53.360" style="s2">and you&#39;d have one ruler in the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.600" end="00:55:55.250" style="s2">dimension one ruler and the in the space</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.360" end="00:55:57.500" style="s2">dimension so think about a watch versus</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.250" end="00:55:59.000" style="s2">an actual ruler and you&#39;d have an angle</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.500" end="00:56:01.640" style="s2">between the two which would be your</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.000" end="00:56:04.700" style="s2">protractor so there&#39;d be three pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.640" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">extra data and then if you threw out</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.700" end="00:56:10.820" style="s2">just the way you cut through that like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:13.490" style="s2">let&#39;s say paper towel core have your</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.820" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">positive and your negative now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.490" end="00:56:17.600" style="s2">got three pieces of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:21.170" style="s2">three-dimensional space of two rulers</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.600" end="00:56:23.120" style="s2">plus one protractor and it looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.170" end="00:56:25.990" style="s2">giant butterfly and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.120" end="00:56:29.180" style="s2">three-dimensional space and it cuts out</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.990" end="00:56:31.340" style="s2">it looks you know that thing jugglers</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.180" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">use called a Diablo which is like oh</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.340" end="00:56:35.950" style="s2">they&#39;re like they are it&#39;s a wheel on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">string oh yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.950" end="00:56:41.660" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of that the bad stuff now</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:46.360" style="s2">looks like kind of the beginning of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.660" end="00:56:49.040" style="s2">Diablo and so you have three sections</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.360" end="00:56:50.630" style="s2">two in the wings call it a butterfly ER</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.040" end="00:56:53.630" style="s2">and then there&#39;s one that kind of goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.630" end="00:56:57.380" style="s2">around where the string would normally</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.630" end="00:56:59.810" style="s2">go on that kind of flywheel contraption</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.380" end="00:57:02.450" style="s2">and those three things would be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.810" end="00:57:05.960" style="s2">three different possible signatures to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.450" end="00:57:09.110" style="s2">to to of time none of space one of time</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.960" end="00:57:11.660" style="s2">in one of space two of space</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.110" end="00:57:13.580" style="s2">none of time so those are the three</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.660" end="00:57:16.190" style="s2">possible ways of dividing up two</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.580" end="00:57:19.160" style="s2">dimensions into three into space and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.190" end="00:57:21.380" style="s2">time okay this is this is one of many</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.160" end="00:57:23.240" style="s2">points along the way where I begin to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.380" end="00:57:24.860" style="s2">doubt that I know what we are even</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.240" end="00:57:27.740" style="s2">discussing well all I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.860" end="00:57:29.540" style="s2">is people want to know what&#39;s new what</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.740" end="00:57:31.190" style="s2">are you doing and they don&#39;t usually go</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.540" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">back to well what is we already</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.190" end="00:57:36.490" style="s2">established is pretty solid and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:40.430" style="s2">interesting so Einstein told us that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.490" end="00:57:43.400" style="s2">space-time is four dimensions four</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.430" end="00:57:45.770" style="s2">possible degrees of freedom with rulers</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.400" end="00:57:48.800" style="s2">and protractors and the ruler that goes</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.770" end="00:57:50.330" style="s2">in the direction of the time is of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.800" end="00:57:51.380" style="s2">different nature than the rulers that go</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.330" end="00:57:55.130" style="s2">in the direction of space</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.380" end="00:57:57.190" style="s2">and there are six angles rather than in</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.130" end="00:57:59.089" style="s2">this case that we just did one angle</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.190" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">because there was only one time in one</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.089" end="00:58:04.779" style="s2">space and that is where we begin the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:08.509" style="s2">puzzle which is how does one</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.779" end="00:58:10.849" style="s2">disintermediate Einstein like if</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.509" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">Einstein has a flaw and Einsteins flaw</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.849" end="00:58:14.089" style="s2">is holding us back and by the way this</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:15.650" style="s2">is a terrifying thing to say because we</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.089" end="00:58:16.700" style="s2">all love Einstein sure which we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.650" end="00:58:18.589" style="s2">get we don&#39;t want to get rid of the guy</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.700" end="00:58:20.390" style="s2">yeah we can&#39;t disentangle the lovable</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.589" end="00:58:23.750" style="s2">guy who made huge progress from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.390" end="00:58:25.039" style="s2">possibility that we&#39;re his work well you</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.750" end="00:58:27.500" style="s2">have to trust that you&#39;re gonna that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.039" end="00:58:29.240" style="s2">what you do will honor him in the end</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.500" end="00:58:30.680" style="s2">but you can&#39;t honor him in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.240" end="00:58:33.289" style="s2">you actually have to go after him in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.680" end="00:58:35.240" style="s2">middle yeah is the tough part right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.289" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">and in some sense he was just such a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.240" end="00:58:39.410" style="s2">beautiful soul that we also want to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:44.119" style="s2">sure that we don&#39;t do any damage to that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.410" end="00:58:49.069" style="s2">soul yeah okay so in this situation what</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.119" end="00:58:51.349" style="s2">I would say is Einstein threw away all</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.069" end="00:58:54.619" style="s2">but the space-time metric that he</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.349" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">believed in so in other words he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.619" end="00:59:00.769" style="s2">allow the stuff in the universe to dance</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:02.329" style="s2">on top of the rulers and protractors he</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.769" end="00:59:05.900" style="s2">just chose one set of rulers and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.329" end="00:59:08.359" style="s2">protractors and then he said that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.900" end="00:59:09.559" style="s2">stuff in the universe is engaged in one</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.359" end="00:59:12.410" style="s2">equation called the Einstein field</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.559" end="00:59:13.970" style="s2">equations with that stuff okay so I know</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.410" end="00:59:17.509" style="s2">I&#39;m full of shit here but I also have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.970" end="00:59:20.150" style="s2">feeling it&#39;s metaphorically right okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.509" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">this is the thing that&#39;s that causes</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.150" end="00:59:27.079" style="s2">fields to get stuck and it is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:29.390" style="s2">diminishing returns causes a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.079" end="00:59:31.450" style="s2">failure and the cognitive failure is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.390" end="00:59:34.220" style="s2">that that which works really well</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.450" end="00:59:36.619" style="s2">becomes reinforced as the mechanism to</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.220" end="00:59:39.380" style="s2">go forward because at a temporary moment</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.619" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">which may be an entire career you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.380" end="00:59:42.789" style="s2">going forward with this thing and so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">become convinced that it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.789" end="00:59:47.650" style="s2">accurate and the problem is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:51.140" style="s2">accurate until it starts robbing you</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.650" end="00:59:54.200" style="s2">good so what I would say is you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.140" end="00:59:56.660" style="s2">making an appeal towards a paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.200" end="00:59:58.190" style="s2">we most often associate with economics</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.660" end="01:00:00.500" style="s2">even though it shouldn&#39;t be associated</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.190" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">with the economics right what I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.500" end="01:00:04.730" style="s2">then say is in fact the parallel is</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:09.610" style="s2">better with</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.730" end="01:00:11.900" style="s2">evolutionary theory which is your old</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.610" end="01:00:14.720" style="s2">stomping ground of civil right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.900" end="01:00:19.580" style="s2">adaptive landscape theory the key point</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.720" end="01:00:21.470" style="s2">is you have to go down in a valley to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.580" end="01:00:23.180" style="s2">get to a higher peak you may be on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.470" end="01:00:26.150" style="s2">highest point of the peak that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.180" end="01:00:29.180" style="s2">about on a local optimum and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.150" end="01:00:32.210" style="s2">where we got stuck which is everything</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.180" end="01:00:34.910" style="s2">you do that you try to go beyond</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.210" end="01:00:37.670" style="s2">Einstein if you get punished yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.910" end="01:00:40.210" style="s2">yeah no this is exactly right and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.670" end="01:00:42.500" style="s2">arms those who want to stick to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.210" end="01:00:45.590" style="s2">paradigm which then becomes an economic</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.500" end="01:00:48.440" style="s2">problem because we award the power in</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.590" end="01:00:49.610" style="s2">these fields to those who have made</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.440" end="01:00:51.170" style="s2">great progress and then they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.610" end="01:00:52.970" style="s2">position at the point that they well</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.170" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">then we get in a different situation</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.970" end="01:00:58.040" style="s2">which I don&#39;t I mean if you really want</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:59.840" style="s2">to expand on that I would say they</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.040" end="01:01:01.910" style="s2">become the Catholic Church and they</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.840" end="01:01:04.490" style="s2">start to hand out indulgences which is</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.910" end="01:01:07.340" style="s2">if you want to violate the paradigm this</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.490" end="01:01:09.560" style="s2">particular violation of the paradigm is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.340" end="01:01:11.720" style="s2">blessed and all others are cursed Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.560" end="01:01:14.390" style="s2">right and so the idea is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.720" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">suspend the usual rules about experiment</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.390" end="01:01:18.410" style="s2">let&#39;s say for string theorists we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:20.660" style="s2">brilliant that they don&#39;t need to be in</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.410" end="01:01:21.830" style="s2">touch with experiment but everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.660" end="01:01:23.990" style="s2">who comes up with an idea we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.830" end="01:01:27.500" style="s2">immediately ask what does it predict so</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.990" end="01:01:30.080" style="s2">dude yeah this is why I want you to</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.500" end="01:01:34.820" style="s2">consider the possibility that theory is</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.080" end="01:01:37.010" style="s2">the wrong designation because if so</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.820" end="01:01:41.000" style="s2">here&#39;s the point over in biology space</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.010" end="01:01:42.800" style="s2">we swear that evolution when we say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.000" end="01:01:44.900" style="s2">just a theory we don&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.800" end="01:01:47.510" style="s2">less it&#39;s as close to saying its effect</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.900" end="01:01:50.300" style="s2">as we ever get right it has been so</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.510" end="01:01:53.570" style="s2">thoroughly demonstrated to be accurate</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.300" end="01:01:55.310" style="s2">that we are treating it as a fact until</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.570" end="01:01:56.870" style="s2">we discover something that dislodges it</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.310" end="01:01:58.670" style="s2">like this is all a simulation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.870" end="01:02:01.130" style="s2">evolution was put in it to see what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.670" end="01:02:03.260" style="s2">would think right something like that so</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.130" end="01:02:06.410" style="s2">evolution is as close to effect as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.260" end="01:02:10.060" style="s2">get and we call it a theory my point</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.410" end="01:02:12.530" style="s2">would be at the point that your work</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.060" end="01:02:15.610" style="s2">predicts things in the world that lead</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.530" end="01:02:18.830" style="s2">us to understand that it is at least</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.610" end="01:02:21.080" style="s2">highly accurate and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.830" end="01:02:22.310" style="s2">the final step in our quest to figure</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.080" end="01:02:24.110" style="s2">out how the universe works</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.310" end="01:02:27.500" style="s2">then it becomes a theory and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.110" end="01:02:29.650" style="s2">only ever one theory at a time right but</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.500" end="01:02:32.030" style="s2">the problem is over in physics because</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.650" end="01:02:32.690" style="s2">physics people are sloppy about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.030" end="01:02:35.240" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.690" end="01:02:37.430" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people string theorists</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.240" end="01:02:39.110" style="s2">engaged in string theory and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.430" end="01:02:41.090" style="s2">is their work doesn&#39;t even rise to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.110" end="01:02:43.850" style="s2">level of hypothesis I&#39;ll say things like</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.090" end="01:02:44.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not a theory it&#39;s a program but</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.850" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">that&#39;s my point</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.540" end="01:02:49.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually yeah Phylis philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.640" end="01:02:51.800" style="s2">science wise string theory is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.640" end="01:02:54.500" style="s2">interpretation kit I want to try to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.800" end="01:02:58.820" style="s2">something a little bit more horrible</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.500" end="01:03:01.540" style="s2">okay why are we spending our time in</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.820" end="01:03:04.100" style="s2">philosophy of science when we as science</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.540" end="01:03:06.850" style="s2">scientists spend too much time in</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.100" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">philosophy of science we have failed and</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.850" end="01:03:12.770" style="s2">one of my concerns is is that with all</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">of the ink spilled on what is science</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.770" end="01:03:19.240" style="s2">what is a science what is a theory what</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">is a hope what is a prediction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.240" end="01:03:24.560" style="s2">what happens when people aren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:26.930" style="s2">do good science for a long period of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.560" end="01:03:30.110" style="s2">time no no I believe you are making a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.930" end="01:03:32.030" style="s2">mistake and by the way you make an</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.110" end="01:03:34.970" style="s2">excellent point about what you call</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.030" end="01:03:36.650" style="s2">desperation physics so I believe you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.970" end="01:03:39.110" style="s2">conflating think that may have been</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.650" end="01:03:41.240" style="s2">Powell Eastern well you and Hallie have</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.110" end="01:03:44.840" style="s2">done very well with this art but in any</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.240" end="01:03:48.620" style="s2">case desperation physics is real I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.840" end="01:03:51.740" style="s2">well familiar with it philosophy can</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.620" end="01:03:53.300" style="s2">become another version of desperation</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.740" end="01:03:54.680" style="s2">physics or desperation whatever science</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.300" end="01:03:56.690" style="s2">you want to talk about it is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.680" end="01:03:58.280" style="s2">inherently that and so my point would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.690" end="01:04:00.260" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t need to spend a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.280" end="01:04:02.900" style="s2">of time in philosophy of science space</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.260" end="01:04:06.350" style="s2">but you need to spend enough time and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.900" end="01:04:09.140" style="s2">that in effect what you&#39;ve got in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.350" end="01:04:12.380" style="s2">physics is you have the string the so</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.140" end="01:04:15.740" style="s2">called string theory community which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.380" end="01:04:19.010" style="s2">effectively like all of the suitors and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.740" end="01:04:22.970" style="s2">other lowlifes in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.010" end="01:04:25.780" style="s2">manor right and Odysseus is coming home</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.970" end="01:04:29.660" style="s2">to liberate the manor and save Penelope</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.780" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">right the point is the the coming home</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.660" end="01:04:32.810" style="s2">the stringing the bow the saving</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:35.780" style="s2">Penelope</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.810" end="01:04:36.860" style="s2">is actually done with the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.780" end="01:04:39.020" style="s2">that says these people are not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.860" end="01:04:42.080" style="s2">legitimate here how do we know because</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.020" end="01:04:43.700" style="s2">they have dressed up a notion that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.080" end="01:04:46.760" style="s2">if we&#39;re generous is an interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.700" end="01:04:49.850" style="s2">they have dressed it up as if it has the</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.760" end="01:04:51.380" style="s2">power of a theory it doesn&#39;t even want</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.850" end="01:04:52.610" style="s2">rise to the level of hypothesis but</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.380" end="01:04:55.100" style="s2">they&#39;re claiming it&#39;s a theory</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.610" end="01:04:56.810" style="s2">these people are illegitimate and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.100" end="01:04:58.940" style="s2">anyway I think that the amount I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.810" end="01:05:01.010" style="s2">you know that took three sentences four</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.940" end="01:05:03.380" style="s2">sentences and the amount of power that</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.010" end="01:05:06.500" style="s2">comes from recognizing why are we taking</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.380" end="01:05:07.730" style="s2">this as seriously as a hypothesis or a</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.500" end="01:05:11.410" style="s2">theory when it doesn&#39;t rise to that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.730" end="01:05:11.410" style="s2">level so let me just sort of say this</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.620" end="01:05:20.270" style="s2">somebody set up a 24/7 chat room</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.270" end="01:05:23.230" style="s2">facility on the discord platform for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.270" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">portal community and when I pop in by</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.230" end="01:05:28.430" style="s2">you know some some means by which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:30.740" style="s2">quiet and I listen to what people are</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.430" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">talking about a huge amount of the time</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.740" end="01:05:35.330" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about is their free will</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:38.270" style="s2">are there many worlds is something a</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.330" end="01:05:41.330" style="s2">scientific hypothesis what I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.270" end="01:05:43.400" style="s2">interested in is to tell them these are</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.330" end="01:05:45.080" style="s2">very expensive conversations that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.400" end="01:05:47.060" style="s2">gonna take a tremendous amount of your</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.080" end="01:05:49.700" style="s2">life because you&#39;re going to assume that</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.060" end="01:05:51.980" style="s2">there&#39;s more to this and quite honestly</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.700" end="01:05:55.310" style="s2">you and I can be in different places my</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.980" end="01:05:57.350" style="s2">feeling about this is science is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.310" end="01:05:59.630" style="s2">totality of things that have worked to</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.350" end="01:06:01.250" style="s2">produce fairly reliable knowledge and at</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.630" end="01:06:04.640" style="s2">the end of the day I believe that this</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.250" end="01:06:07.580" style="s2">is about taste and about not wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.640" end="01:06:10.070" style="s2">be thwacked you know in general most</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.580" end="01:06:13.880" style="s2">musicians have a pretty clear idea about</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.070" end="01:06:17.420" style="s2">the hierarchy of musicianship music is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.880" end="01:06:19.730" style="s2">very large space it&#39;s not linearly</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.420" end="01:06:21.320" style="s2">ordered I&#39;m not going to pretend that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.730" end="01:06:26.360" style="s2">all you know have the same favorite</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.320" end="01:06:29.060" style="s2">guitarists but most of the time you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.360" end="01:06:30.530" style="s2">say you know Hilary Hahn is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.060" end="01:06:34.940" style="s2">greatest violinists in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.530" end="01:06:37.550" style="s2">everybody knows it and when science is</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.940" end="01:06:41.390" style="s2">working we don&#39;t spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.550" end="01:06:43.880" style="s2">saying is this science we spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.390" end="01:06:45.710" style="s2">time talking about is the science is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.880" end="01:06:46.770" style="s2">this settled when we&#39;re in politics</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.710" end="01:06:49.980" style="s2">space when the feel</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.770" end="01:06:53.430" style="s2">stagnated when there&#39;s a dispute in</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.980" end="01:06:57.840" style="s2">which people refuse to say that logic or</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.430" end="01:07:00.270" style="s2">data adjudicated and this may be</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.840" end="01:07:06.930" style="s2">different for evolutionary theory in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.270" end="01:07:10.530" style="s2">physics but from my perspective I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.930" end="01:07:12.150" style="s2">enjoy being dragged into the demarcation</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.530" end="01:07:14.910" style="s2">problem by people who want to say oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.150" end="01:07:17.040" style="s2">you&#39;re a consequentialist or I actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.910" end="01:07:19.290" style="s2">I&#39;m coming here compatible I I&#39;m from an</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.040" end="01:07:20.460" style="s2">EOP Parian perspective it&#39;s like oh is</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.290" end="01:07:22.170" style="s2">that are you telling me that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.460" end="01:07:23.700" style="s2">do work yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.170" end="01:07:24.120" style="s2">telling you what you think I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.700" end="01:07:26.490" style="s2">you okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.120" end="01:07:28.280" style="s2">because the other part of this riff is</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.490" end="01:07:30.930" style="s2">that this is not supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.280" end="01:07:33.450" style="s2">scientists having this discussion yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.930" end="01:07:35.910" style="s2">but the scientists and like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.450" end="01:07:38.850" style="s2">so dead for so long in what I care about</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.910" end="01:07:41.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all dead I mean you&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.850" end="01:07:47.040" style="s2">entire Academy for wintered evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.310" end="01:07:49.020" style="s2">theory stuff 1976 pretty much not</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.040" end="01:07:50.790" style="s2">entirely but pretty much yeah and pretty</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.020" end="01:07:53.730" style="s2">much in some sense the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.790" end="01:07:56.600" style="s2">theoretical physics that I weep over and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.730" end="01:08:02.360" style="s2">gives me jitters stopped around 1973</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.600" end="01:08:05.070" style="s2">okay now my point would be somehow we</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.360" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">civilization subsidizes a certain number</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.070" end="01:08:08.850" style="s2">of philosophers including a certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:10.230" style="s2">number of philosophers of science who</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.850" end="01:08:12.390" style="s2">are confused</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.230" end="01:08:14.490" style="s2">for the most part into thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.390" end="01:08:17.160" style="s2">their job is to talk to each other right</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.490" end="01:08:18.930" style="s2">rather than to adjudicate what</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.160" end="01:08:20.160" style="s2">constitutes science on the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.930" end="01:08:23.490" style="s2">rules that are actually pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.160" end="01:08:24.930" style="s2">understood and so I am NOT arguing that</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.490" end="01:08:28.170" style="s2">we should be spending our time on this</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.930" end="01:08:29.970" style="s2">but I&#39;m arguing that their failure means</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.170" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">that a small amount of investment in</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.970" end="01:08:33.870" style="s2">just getting our terminology even</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:37.470" style="s2">straight so that when we make a claim we</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.870" end="01:08:39.960" style="s2">are you know when physicists use the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.470" end="01:08:42.870" style="s2">word theory right for a hypothesis they</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.960" end="01:08:44.910" style="s2">upend biologists who are saying actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.870" end="01:08:46.170" style="s2">when we say yeah Darwinism is a theory</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.910" end="01:08:47.819" style="s2">we made something very close I</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.170" end="01:08:49.500" style="s2">appreciate but you have to understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.819" end="01:08:51.150" style="s2">people get into this argument over</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.500" end="01:08:53.910" style="s2">Darwinism because they&#39;re afraid of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.150" end="01:08:56.490" style="s2">absurd god yes okay I have a different</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.910" end="01:08:59.400" style="s2">problem which is that in general when</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.490" end="01:09:00.630" style="s2">physics isn&#39;t moving people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.400" end="01:09:02.069" style="s2">getting more adventurous</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.630" end="01:09:04.949" style="s2">who they&#39;re listening to they&#39;re staying</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.069" end="01:09:08.219" style="s2">with the same Pope&#39;s sure so I could</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.949" end="01:09:11.370" style="s2">turn to Karl Popper yeah or I could turn</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.219" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">to Ludacris and I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.370" end="01:09:13.980" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with the lyrics to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:16.920" style="s2">song get out the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.980" end="01:09:18.389" style="s2">now of course okay so my feeling is you</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.920" end="01:09:20.850" style="s2">should say them for my audience who may</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.389" end="01:09:22.409" style="s2">be somewhat less familiar I&#39;m an old guy</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.850" end="01:09:25.020" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember the lyrics exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.409" end="01:09:26.909" style="s2">however my feeling is strongly that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.020" end="01:09:29.159" style="s2">should be following Ludacris rather than</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.909" end="01:09:29.880" style="s2">Karl Popper because I don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.159" end="01:09:32.100" style="s2">for this</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.880" end="01:09:33.750" style="s2">no you do have time for it for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.100" end="01:09:35.940" style="s2">following reason that it&#39;s a time-saver</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.750" end="01:09:38.520" style="s2">now we are wasting time here</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.940" end="01:09:43.139" style="s2">but that&#39;s not well that&#39;s not but I my</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.520" end="01:09:46.020" style="s2">point is you&#39;ve got suitors in the manor</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.139" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">so string the bow string the fucking</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.020" end="01:09:50.159" style="s2">boat single deploy but stringing the bow</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:53.009" style="s2">involves just saying hey you string</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.159" end="01:09:56.639" style="s2">theorists you have an interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.009" end="01:09:59.130" style="s2">you&#39;re not theorists there was a guy</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.639" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">named julian schwinger who was fineman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.130" end="01:10:03.630" style="s2">rival and came up with his version of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:05.100" style="s2">what we call renormalization theory to</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.630" end="01:10:08.070" style="s2">get answers out of quantum</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.100" end="01:10:10.560" style="s2">electrodynamics and he had an epigram</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.070" end="01:10:12.330" style="s2">for a book that he had to write because</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.560" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">nobody was taking him seriously and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.330" end="01:10:17.730" style="s2">epigram was if you can&#39;t join them beat</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:21.750" style="s2">the beat them yeah mm-hmm so my feeling</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.730" end="01:10:24.239" style="s2">is is that I could spend the rest of my</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.750" end="01:10:25.830" style="s2">life trying to get their attention and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:28.440" style="s2">saying oh pretty please listen to this</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.830" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve got I&#39;m also just sick</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.440" end="01:10:33.210" style="s2">of them I mean I&#39;m just I&#39;m sick of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.920" style="s2">critique I&#39;m sick of the discussions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.210" end="01:10:37.830" style="s2">sick of the same people getting trotted</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.920" end="01:10:40.350" style="s2">out over and over again I&#39;m bored sure</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.830" end="01:10:42.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re all bored if so my feeling is</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.350" end="01:10:45.389" style="s2">let&#39;s do non boring things right but</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.120" end="01:10:48.570" style="s2">your work okay I still don&#39;t get it we</p>

<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:46.480" style="s2">with something that doesn&#39;t really merit</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.989" end="01:13:48.910" style="s2">there today are so weak at this point it</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.480" end="01:13:51.400" style="s2">is so past their sell-by date and not</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.910" end="01:13:53.920" style="s2">because of the string theory it is the</p>

<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:03.250" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna declare as string theory</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.370" end="01:14:06.460" style="s2">anyway if it&#39;s true so we got this my</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.250" end="01:14:08.500" style="s2">feeling is you just wasted people&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.460" end="01:14:10.330" style="s2">depending upon how we count based in</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.500" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">people&#39;s lives wasted crews lives</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.330" end="01:14:16.090" style="s2">careers you spent the entire credibility</p>

<p begin="01:14:16.090" end="01:14:21.969" style="s2">community on a baby-boomer vanity</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.030" end="01:14:23.860" style="s2">project move over it&#39;s enough totally</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.969" end="01:14:25.810" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you would agree with</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.860" end="01:14:27.340" style="s2">this exactly but I would say look the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.810" end="01:14:28.780" style="s2">reason that this happens in every field</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.340" end="01:14:30.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s completely maddening with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.780" end="01:14:33.449" style="s2">strings theorists but it&#39;s not totally</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.580" end="01:14:38.350" style="s2">unique is that there is no mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.449" end="01:14:41.590" style="s2">whereby a school of thought that has run</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.350" end="01:14:44.680" style="s2">out of power to explain new things can</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.590" end="01:14:46.420" style="s2">be dislodged right the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.680" end="01:14:48.640" style="s2">grant money keeps coming in or the jobs</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.420" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">keep getting bored there is something</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.640" end="01:14:52.750" style="s2">which is money like for example there</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:54.580" style="s2">was a death of a very rich person in</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.750" end="01:14:57.190" style="s2">Chicago which I think was left at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.580" end="01:14:58.600" style="s2">Poetry Foundation right so hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.190" end="01:14:59.260" style="s2">millions became available remember</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.600" end="01:15:01.210" style="s2">poetry</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.260" end="01:15:02.949" style="s2">yeah okay if you had hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.210" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">millions to disintermediate strength</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.949" end="01:15:07.300" style="s2">there you could do it in an afternoon</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:08.710" style="s2">sure but my point would be the way to</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.300" end="01:15:10.840" style="s2">deal with this so it doesn&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.710" end="01:15:12.880" style="s2">happening is on the front end and</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.840" end="01:15:15.699" style="s2">frankly I&#39;m not even sure I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.880" end="01:15:17.980" style="s2">this from you but if instead of allowing</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.699" end="01:15:19.810" style="s2">the field the school of thought that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.980" end="01:15:21.580" style="s2">the most promising at the moment to take</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.810" end="01:15:24.280" style="s2">over the field at which point it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.580" end="01:15:26.320" style="s2">impossible to design fails if you kept</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.280" end="01:15:28.390" style="s2">the second-best school of thought alive</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.320" end="01:15:30.280" style="s2">at all times so it the point that a</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.390" end="01:15:32.830" style="s2">school of thought has failed it has its</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.280" end="01:15:34.360" style="s2">natural replacement ready to go the</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.830" end="01:15:36.989" style="s2">movie in a better position but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.360" end="01:15:36.989" style="s2">let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.260" end="01:15:43.330" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna end up in one more of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.920" end="01:15:47.080" style="s2">diversion discussions which I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.330" end="01:15:49.090" style="s2">stand but here&#39;s the real deal</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.080" end="01:15:51.670" style="s2">with respect to the string theorists</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.090" end="01:15:54.850" style="s2">were smarter than the general</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.670" end="01:15:57.190" style="s2">relativists they were more creative</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.850" end="01:15:58.990" style="s2">string theory gave them some place to</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.190" end="01:16:03.370" style="s2">demonstrate that they were smarter and</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.990" end="01:16:06.370" style="s2">more creative okay yep as a result the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.370" end="01:16:10.360" style="s2">smart creative people went into an area</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.370" end="01:16:11.890" style="s2">that turned out not to work now it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.360" end="01:16:13.540" style="s2">to say that some portion of it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.890" end="01:16:18.720" style="s2">will not be salvageable because it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.540" end="01:16:21.460" style="s2">real work of a mathematical type but</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.720" end="01:16:23.500" style="s2">part of the problem is how do I figure</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.460" end="01:16:25.720" style="s2">out how to rationalize giving money to</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.500" end="01:16:26.980" style="s2">people who are not as good as the top</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.720" end="01:16:30.700" style="s2">people who&#39;ve all rallied around</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.980" end="01:16:32.980" style="s2">something uh-huh and so you have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.700" end="01:16:37.780" style="s2">chicken and egg problem now let me just</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.980" end="01:16:39.640" style="s2">say very clearly that this is not this</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.780" end="01:16:41.740" style="s2">is like a peer-review problem this is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.640" end="01:16:43.180" style="s2">science is social this is like selecting</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.740" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">for people with high emotional</p>

<p begin="01:16:48.760" end="01:16:52.810" style="s2">somewhere else but we try not to use our</p>

<p begin="01:16:52.810" end="01:16:59.760" style="s2">science because it screws up our science</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.940" end="01:17:02.350" style="s2">because in fact science isn&#39;t about like</p>

<p begin="01:17:02.350" end="01:17:06.370" style="s2">to sometimes it works in teams sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.360" end="01:17:09.490" style="s2">the team is the problem</p>

<p begin="01:17:09.490" end="01:17:14.230" style="s2">essence being able to say shut up to</p>

<p begin="01:17:22.660" end="01:17:27.580" style="s2">know what policy projected over a pass</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.570" end="01:17:29.530" style="s2">that we all know who the heroes were oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.580" end="01:17:32.350" style="s2">my god Newton was mean to me you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.530" end="01:17:34.720" style="s2">now he doesn&#39;t have a job yeah okay well</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.350" end="01:17:37.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve just showed us I I would not send</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.720" end="01:17:39.580" style="s2">my child to a university that announced</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.840" end="01:17:41.710" style="s2">that it had in no assholes policy on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.580" end="01:17:45.190" style="s2">faculty I might say I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.710" end="01:17:48.480" style="s2">tolerate assholic behavior yep or unfair</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.190" end="01:17:50.470" style="s2">behavior sure but like hard nosed yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.480" end="01:17:51.430" style="s2">no I mean you&#39;ve been making this point</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.470" end="01:17:53.470" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.430" end="01:17:56.530" style="s2">first place I heard you make it was with</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.470" end="01:17:58.720" style="s2">reference to medicine and your point was</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.530" end="01:18:01.480" style="s2">very frequently the doctor you want is</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.720" end="01:18:04.300" style="s2">an ornery son of a bitch that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.480" end="01:18:06.730" style="s2">the people who will end up with our</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.300" end="01:18:10.120" style="s2">first child was delivered by the ornery</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.730" end="01:18:12.940" style="s2">son of a bitch in a OBGYN practice who</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.120" end="01:18:17.350" style="s2">saved us from the doctor we loved yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.940" end="01:18:19.390" style="s2">give me the son of a bitch no exactly no</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.350" end="01:18:21.070" style="s2">the person the person who makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.390" end="01:18:22.630" style="s2">tells you what&#39;s really going on I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.070" end="01:18:24.160" style="s2">have to have tea with that person I got</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.630" end="01:18:25.360" style="s2">my kid home from the hospital safe</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.160" end="01:18:27.280" style="s2">frankly I&#39;d actually rather have tea</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.360" end="01:18:29.680" style="s2">with them because well maybe they make</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.280" end="01:18:32.500" style="s2">some kind of sense maybe but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.680" end="01:18:35.080" style="s2">all right we&#39;re bogged down what I want</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.500" end="01:18:37.960" style="s2">to extract we&#39;re obviously not gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.080" end="01:18:41.340" style="s2">to everything today but okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.960" end="01:18:43.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve got rollers and protractors right</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.340" end="01:18:46.960" style="s2">rulers and protractors means something</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.660" end="01:18:51.580" style="s2">these are tools for unpacking a system</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.960" end="01:18:54.490" style="s2">the system is the universe and my sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.580" end="01:19:01.290" style="s2">is that you play some kind of a game and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.490" end="01:19:04.870" style="s2">the game is like how many categories and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.290" end="01:19:07.840" style="s2">tools do I need before there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.870" end="01:19:10.330" style="s2">residual that I can&#39;t explain about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.840" end="01:19:12.550" style="s2">observed right that&#39;s how I know when</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.330" end="01:19:15.010" style="s2">the game is over right that&#39;s how I know</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.550" end="01:19:16.990" style="s2">when this is well actually to be blunt</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.010" end="01:19:20.320" style="s2">about it the really weird thing about my</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.990" end="01:19:26.710" style="s2">theory again my theory in my own concept</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.320" end="01:19:29.020" style="s2">I can&#39;t get into yours is you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.710" end="01:19:30.640" style="s2">you&#39;re what 30 trillion cells 60</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.020" end="01:19:31.810" style="s2">trillion cells you know the number keeps</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.640" end="01:19:33.370" style="s2">changing I would say the current</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.810" end="01:19:36.850" style="s2">estimates that could be such an easy</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.370" end="01:19:40.120" style="s2">catch I know but 30 trillion is here 32</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.850" end="01:19:43.060" style="s2">yeah okay how did that result and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.120" end="01:19:45.520" style="s2">what 250 adult cell types a estimate as</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.060" end="01:19:47.440" style="s2">as far as we know as far as we know okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.520" end="01:19:50.590" style="s2">that all started from a single</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.440" end="01:19:52.030" style="s2">fertilized egg which is I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.590" end="01:19:54.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get better than this now</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.030" end="01:19:58.720" style="s2">okay so miracle so how does that thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.220" end="01:20:03.249" style="s2">have the information largely to become</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.720" end="01:20:06.079" style="s2">you well it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.249" end="01:20:08.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a process of unpacking the</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.079" end="01:20:10.699" style="s2">consequences of a very simple seeming</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.570" end="01:20:14.300" style="s2">initial object I have an innocuous</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.699" end="01:20:16.219" style="s2">fertilized egg what could it possibly</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.300" end="01:20:17.900" style="s2">become nobody way to ever guess that it</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.219" end="01:20:19.849" style="s2">would become you right from first</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.900" end="01:20:23.449" style="s2">principles right so that was part of</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.849" end="01:20:25.039" style="s2">what I was trying to do with with a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.449" end="01:20:27.320" style="s2">theory of everything is like is there</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.039" end="01:20:30.289" style="s2">anything that unpacks into something</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.320" end="01:20:32.269" style="s2">that has the richness of our world is</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.289" end="01:20:35.380" style="s2">there anything with almost no evidence</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.269" end="01:20:37.729" style="s2">structure whose consequence is us</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.380" end="01:20:39.320" style="s2">because there&#39;s tons of evidence</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.729" end="01:20:40.729" style="s2">structures ok that&#39;s beautiful I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.320" end="01:20:43.400" style="s2">never heard you say that before but it</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.729" end="01:20:45.829" style="s2">dovetails exactly ok so in this case for</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.400" end="01:20:48.199" style="s2">example that simple hairband where you</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.829" end="01:20:52.090" style="s2">shrink the radius of that little tube</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.199" end="01:20:58.130" style="s2">down to an infinitesimal amount you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.090" end="01:21:01.999" style="s2">generates a paper towel core that falls</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.130" end="01:21:05.300" style="s2">into two pieces turning that into the</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.999" end="01:21:08.749" style="s2">analog of space-time is wrapping that</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.300" end="01:21:12.170" style="s2">hairband in some way around the towel</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.749" end="01:21:14.409" style="s2">core so that it goes around once right</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.170" end="01:21:17.869" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost me the towel core I thought</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.409" end="01:21:21.170" style="s2">all rulers that could go at any point so</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.869" end="01:21:23.239" style="s2">just move the bit of the hairband up so</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.170" end="01:21:25.999" style="s2">though if you put the hairband on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.239" end="01:21:29.119" style="s2">towel right roll then you can you could</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.999" end="01:21:30.530" style="s2">mark every space and then you could move</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.119" end="01:21:32.599" style="s2">it up and down and that would tell you</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.530" end="01:21:34.550" style="s2">which rules and you can move it up over</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.599" end="01:21:36.709" style="s2">here and down over there so it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.550" end="01:21:38.239" style="s2">big ruler at this power up and small but</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.709" end="01:21:40.039" style="s2">the idea is that each point on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.239" end="01:21:42.079" style="s2">hairband only goes through one ruler</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.039" end="01:21:44.719" style="s2">which is represented as old the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.079" end="01:21:47.479" style="s2">space of possible rulers each point on</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.719" end="01:21:51.099" style="s2">the band intersects exactly one point on</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.479" end="01:21:54.679" style="s2">the tube one point of the longitudinal</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.099" end="01:21:56.920" style="s2">lines on the tube every point in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.679" end="01:21:59.389" style="s2">hairband only knows through one line</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.920" end="01:22:01.340" style="s2">along the length wise direction of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.389" end="01:22:03.800" style="s2">two yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.340" end="01:22:07.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a choice of a particular ruler</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.800" end="01:22:10.039" style="s2">the line along that tube is the choice</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.639" end="01:22:11.479" style="s2">of all possible rulers so you can order</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.039" end="01:22:13.789" style="s2">any ruler you want from Amazon will</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.479" end="01:22:15.409" style="s2">customize it yeah okay I want this ruler</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.789" end="01:22:15.920" style="s2">for this point this ruler for that point</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.409" end="01:22:20.810" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.920" end="01:22:22.550" style="s2">okay now imagine that you had physics</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.810" end="01:22:24.260" style="s2">that was happening not on the hairband</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.550" end="01:22:28.430" style="s2">but on the tube</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.260" end="01:22:30.200" style="s2">and which like you could ask for the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.430" end="01:22:32.000" style="s2">temperature gradients across the tube</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.200" end="01:22:34.790" style="s2">maybe part of the tube is warm part of</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.000" end="01:22:37.520" style="s2">the tube is cold and the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.790" end="01:22:39.770" style="s2">you&#39;re going to record is what the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.520" end="01:22:42.380" style="s2">temperature was like at that point on</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.770" end="01:22:44.090" style="s2">the tube in the various measure at that</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.380" end="01:22:47.540" style="s2">point that the hairband was around the</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.090" end="01:22:49.550" style="s2">tube yeah that is effectively the new</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.540" end="01:22:50.630" style="s2">use of the space-time metric we knew</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.550" end="01:22:53.210" style="s2">about rulers and we knew about</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.630" end="01:22:56.510" style="s2">protractors but we don&#39;t have a model in</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.210" end="01:22:58.790" style="s2">which that is a periscope importing</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.510" end="01:23:01.820" style="s2">information from the tube back to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.790" end="01:23:04.370" style="s2">hairband so the game then is what is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.820" end="01:23:06.740" style="s2">minimally complex geometric structure</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.370" end="01:23:08.540" style="s2">that provides you enough richness that</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.740" end="01:23:12.740" style="s2">you can get to all of the states you</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.540" end="01:23:14.150" style="s2">need with a simple description of sort</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.740" end="01:23:16.130" style="s2">of let me just test to see whether or</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.150" end="01:23:17.780" style="s2">not I understood you in my case what I</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.130" end="01:23:20.950" style="s2">would say is that the hairband has</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.780" end="01:23:24.380" style="s2">enough data so the hairband is like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.950" end="01:23:26.900" style="s2">the fertilized a yeah has enough data to</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.380" end="01:23:28.700" style="s2">build the tube which is tell me about</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.900" end="01:23:30.430" style="s2">the space of all rulers I could have at</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.700" end="01:23:33.500" style="s2">every point on the hairband yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.430" end="01:23:34.490" style="s2">measuring the tangent directions then on</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.500" end="01:23:37.340" style="s2">the hairband</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.490" end="01:23:42.380" style="s2">now that the hairband is generated the</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.340" end="01:23:45.500" style="s2">paper towel core now I do physics on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.380" end="01:23:48.170" style="s2">paper towel core like it can have fields</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.500" end="01:23:49.730" style="s2">objectively stuff that roam around on</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.170" end="01:23:52.280" style="s2">the towel core that are natural for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.730" end="01:23:54.440" style="s2">towel core and I say well can I perceive</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.280" end="01:23:58.040" style="s2">all of that no you can only perceive the</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.440" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">part that&#39;s along the hairband so and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.040" end="01:24:05.990" style="s2">then the ideas that were fooled in my</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:07.940" style="s2">story into thinking that the physics is</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.990" end="01:24:09.950" style="s2">all happening along the hairband which</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.940" end="01:24:11.990" style="s2">is in our case the four-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.950" end="01:24:13.670" style="s2">world but the physics is actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.990" end="01:24:15.830" style="s2">weirdly happening on this fourteen</p>

<p begin="01:24:37.640" end="01:24:44.660" style="s2">this is a better version of many worlds</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.690" end="01:24:47.690" style="s2">that the particular hairband that</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.660" end="01:24:51.320" style="s2">describes an interaction with the tube</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.690" end="01:24:53.960" style="s2">is like the one world in the many</p>

<p begin="01:24:57.800" end="01:25:02.830" style="s2">quantum mechanical concept due to I</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.530" end="01:25:06.170" style="s2">guess ever it was the popularizer of it</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.830" end="01:25:10.070" style="s2">what I would say is in an observers</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.750" end="01:25:26.510" style="s2">you&#39;re going to attend a soccer game or</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.020" end="01:25:29.150" style="s2">a basketball game and you have stands</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.510" end="01:25:31.100" style="s2">and you have the pitch and so the stands</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.150" end="01:25:32.720" style="s2">are where you perceive what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.100" end="01:25:35.690" style="s2">in the pitch and the pitch is like the</p>

<p begin="01:25:43.280" end="01:25:47.420" style="s2">every particular like you and I went to</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.140" end="01:25:49.460" style="s2">the same game yeah but we saw different</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.420" end="01:25:51.020" style="s2">things because you were seated on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.460" end="01:25:53.510" style="s2">floor and I&#39;m up in the bleachers and</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.020" end="01:25:55.430" style="s2">that I get the part of the many-worlds</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.510" end="01:25:57.410" style="s2">thing that drives well the pain that I</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.430" end="01:25:58.670" style="s2">want to make sure isn&#39;t lurking here I</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.410" end="01:26:04.040" style="s2">mean and if it I&#39;m just trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.670" end="01:26:08.180" style="s2">that I don&#39;t see many universes I see</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.040" end="01:26:13.160" style="s2">one observers and the one observers is a</p>

<p begin="01:26:13.160" end="01:26:16.970" style="s2">and I want to say I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.570" end="01:26:20.270" style="s2">that difficult to understand yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.970" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">which you would be confused if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.270" end="01:26:23.960" style="s2">thought like I&#39;m the only person that</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:26.840" style="s2">exists and I happened to be sitting here</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.960" end="01:26:29.210" style="s2">in the stands and you saw that guy get</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.840" end="01:26:30.680" style="s2">pushed across the way and I didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.210" end="01:26:32.120" style="s2">him get pushed was like you have a</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.680" end="01:26:34.280" style="s2">different view of the action you saw</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.120" end="01:26:36.170" style="s2">things I never saw there&#39;s more going on</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.280" end="01:26:38.330" style="s2">than I could perceive in my seat I get</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.170" end="01:26:40.280" style="s2">that and that I like that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.330" end="01:26:41.770" style="s2">game took place there was one reality of</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.280" end="01:26:44.350" style="s2">the game and there were any</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.770" end="01:26:45.520" style="s2">number of possible edits based on where</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.350" end="01:26:47.620" style="s2">you work there were an infinite number</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.520" end="01:26:48.670" style="s2">of places you could I like the cabinets</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.620" end="01:26:50.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened in the first matrix</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.670" end="01:26:53.260" style="s2">movie that they actually mocked it up in</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.440" end="01:26:55.720" style="s2">3d and then they only took one of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.260" end="01:26:58.240" style="s2">possible camera angles for the CGI</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.720" end="01:27:03.130" style="s2">scenes I didn&#39;t know that yeah so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.240" end="01:27:05.350" style="s2">question though is will your hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.130" end="01:27:07.990" style="s2">in my world theory in your world will it</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.350" end="01:27:09.760" style="s2">rescue us from the idea that all of</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.990" end="01:27:11.800" style="s2">these things are happening that every</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.760" end="01:27:15.070" style="s2">game took place and you just happened to</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.800" end="01:27:18.550" style="s2">be so you&#39;re the thing is is that most</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.070" end="01:27:20.650" style="s2">of what you hear about discussed by the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.550" end="01:27:23.140" style="s2">four or five Talking Heads you may have</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.650" end="01:27:24.580" style="s2">heard of from physics yeah is is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.140" end="01:27:26.500" style="s2">they keep trying to blow your mind with</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.580" end="01:27:28.930" style="s2">the same I know</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.500" end="01:27:30.580" style="s2">repetitive quantum mechanical stuff so</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.930" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">it&#39;s always about many worlds it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.580" end="01:27:34.420" style="s2">entanglement right about the collapse of</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:39.220" style="s2">the wavefunction the shortage bah blah</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.420" end="01:27:44.380" style="s2">blah let&#39;s not go there initially let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.220" end="01:27:46.540" style="s2">fix the geometry underneath both general</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.380" end="01:27:49.150" style="s2">relativity this is great what I&#39;m what</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.540" end="01:27:51.940" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping my prediction is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.150" end="01:27:54.460" style="s2">do that if you fix the geometry then</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.940" end="01:27:57.520" style="s2">many worlds goes away well because in</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.460" end="01:28:00.430" style="s2">part what you&#39;re calling a world yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.520" end="01:28:04.890" style="s2">maybe a perfect a particular way of</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.430" end="01:28:07.540" style="s2">placing the hairband around the core and</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.890" end="01:28:09.880" style="s2">yes there an infinite number of ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.540" end="01:28:12.310" style="s2">placing the hairband around the paper</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.880" end="01:28:13.720" style="s2">towel core that doesn&#39;t bug me right the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.310" end="01:28:15.370" style="s2">thing that bugs me is that they all</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.720" end="01:28:16.900" style="s2">happen and that somebody thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.370" end="01:28:18.730" style="s2">that&#39;s an elegant solution to a problem</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.900" end="01:28:20.320" style="s2">when it&#39;s maximally in elegance but they</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.730" end="01:28:23.110" style="s2">all have to talk to Sean Carroll about</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.320" end="01:28:25.330" style="s2">that that is he&#39;s a believer David</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.110" end="01:28:27.430" style="s2">Deutsch oh I know but anyway I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.330" end="01:28:28.360" style="s2">hoping that your thing blows that out of</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.430" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">the water because I&#39;m sick of hearing</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.360" end="01:28:33.310" style="s2">explanations like that well again you</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:36.580" style="s2">know my point is is that within the</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.310" end="01:28:40.210" style="s2">paradigm that our forefathers left us in</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.580" end="01:28:42.250" style="s2">this case maybe Bohr and Einstein we we</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.210" end="01:28:45.130" style="s2">are doomed</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.250" end="01:28:47.170" style="s2">to infinitely blow our minds on the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.130" end="01:28:52.000" style="s2">set of points without progress and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.170" end="01:28:54.340" style="s2">tired yeah yeah once is enough 100 times</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.000" end="01:28:56.980" style="s2">is pretty good even if a on your on your</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.340" end="01:28:59.230" style="s2">hundred thousandth time it the electron</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.980" end="01:29:02.170" style="s2">goes through both slits you shut them</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.230" end="01:29:03.370" style="s2">doc yeah well everybody does need to go</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.170" end="01:29:05.290" style="s2">through that but that&#39;s the step should</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.370" end="01:29:08.500" style="s2">be the stuff a conical wave is the part</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.290" end="01:29:10.930" style="s2">of it it&#39;s a wave that&#39;s a wave it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.500" end="01:29:12.580" style="s2">wave all right</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.930" end="01:29:14.590" style="s2">sometimes the wave gets measured as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.580" end="01:29:16.210" style="s2">particle a concentrated wave can feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.590" end="01:29:19.000" style="s2">like a particle but it&#39;s a goddamn wave</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.210" end="01:29:22.510" style="s2">nice ah that&#39;s excellent you heard it</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.000" end="01:29:24.700" style="s2">here first all right so we should</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.510" end="01:29:28.930" style="s2">probably figure out how to close this up</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.700" end="01:29:30.910" style="s2">obviously my sense is that what you have</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.930" end="01:29:32.470" style="s2">described is exactly what I was hoping</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.910" end="01:29:36.010" style="s2">you would do which is the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.470" end="01:29:38.020" style="s2">intuitive version of what it is that you</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.010" end="01:29:40.200" style="s2">do and what the sort of thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.020" end="01:29:45.070" style="s2">you think you found and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.200" end="01:29:47.350" style="s2">there&#39;s probably 20 chalkboards full of</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.070" end="01:29:50.260" style="s2">math that mirrors what you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.350" end="01:29:52.900" style="s2">the added value for most of us for the</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.260" end="01:29:55.630" style="s2">math on the board is probably zero or</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.900" end="01:29:57.490" style="s2">near zero right the point is if the math</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.630" end="01:30:01.300" style="s2">is right then what you have just</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.490" end="01:30:02.830" style="s2">described is likely to be true and that</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.300" end="01:30:05.410" style="s2">that would resolve many of the things</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.830" end="01:30:06.790" style="s2">that cause us to get look up what I&#39;m if</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.410" end="01:30:09.520" style="s2">you wanted at that level what I would</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.790" end="01:30:12.190" style="s2">say is Einstein told us take four</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.520" end="01:30:13.960" style="s2">degrees of freedom put four rulers and</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.190" end="01:30:15.940" style="s2">six protractors on top of them which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.960" end="01:30:18.300" style="s2">the right number yeah call that</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.940" end="01:30:20.620" style="s2">space-time and space-time generates</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.300" end="01:30:21.970" style="s2">curvature and curvature is measured by</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.620" end="01:30:24.460" style="s2">the stuff floating around in the system</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.970" end="01:30:25.690" style="s2">so you set the stuff floating around in</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.460" end="01:30:27.010" style="s2">the system the matter and the energy</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.690" end="01:30:28.600" style="s2">equal to the amount of curvature that</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.010" end="01:30:31.780" style="s2">comes out of the rulers and protractors</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.600" end="01:30:37.270" style="s2">and you&#39;re done yeah if you&#39;d like the</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.780" end="01:30:40.030" style="s2">augmentation here is not so fast what if</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.270" end="01:30:42.100" style="s2">the fields that is the stuff the matter</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.030" end="01:30:45.400" style="s2">and the energy bosons and the fermions</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.100" end="01:30:48.100" style="s2">are dancing across all possible rulers</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.400" end="01:30:49.750" style="s2">and all possible protractors and what</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.100" end="01:30:51.880" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re sampling the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.750" end="01:30:56.289" style="s2">rulers and the protractors on one</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.880" end="01:30:59.829" style="s2">particular choice in this case the hare</p>

<p begin="01:30:59.829" end="01:31:03.849" style="s2">pretending that that is the world and</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.629" end="01:31:05.469" style="s2">that&#39;s the universe and that&#39;s us and</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.849" end="01:31:08.049" style="s2">our fate and when did the world begin</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.469" end="01:31:11.249" style="s2">and in some sense you&#39;re asking you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.049" end="01:31:14.109" style="s2">learned to ask an entire set of</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.249" end="01:31:17.649" style="s2">narcissistic questions based on your</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.109" end="01:31:20.799" style="s2">particular perception of the observers</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.649" end="01:31:23.349" style="s2">and the observers is about the pitch and</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.799" end="01:31:25.179" style="s2">the stands being part of the stadium if</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.349" end="01:31:28.059" style="s2">you learned to stop asking questions</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.179" end="01:31:30.549" style="s2">about your experience of the game and</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.059" end="01:31:32.919" style="s2">you ask well what game took place</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.549" end="01:31:34.869" style="s2">yesterday how many people how many</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.919" end="01:31:37.149" style="s2">different things did they see and what</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.869" end="01:31:39.129" style="s2">took place on the pitch independent of</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.149" end="01:31:42.789" style="s2">what I was able to perceive is taking</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.129" end="01:31:44.829" style="s2">place at my seat you know then you start</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.789" end="01:31:47.469" style="s2">to understand like nobody would talk</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.829" end="01:31:50.979" style="s2">about the many games hypothesis where</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.469" end="01:31:53.469" style="s2">every single person experienced a</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.979" end="01:31:54.579" style="s2">different game last night you know and</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.469" end="01:31:56.709" style="s2">they&#39;re in their ways in which the</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.579" end="01:31:58.719" style="s2">stands interact with the pitch because</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.709" end="01:32:01.689" style="s2">everybody&#39;s yelling like missmiss during</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.719" end="01:32:03.549" style="s2">a free throw right yeah and so you also</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.689" end="01:32:05.139" style="s2">have to deal with the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.549" end="01:32:06.429" style="s2">a way in which people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.139" end="01:32:07.119" style="s2">supposed to be part of the game become</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.429" end="01:32:11.019" style="s2">part of the game</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.119" end="01:32:14.679" style="s2">no I love this that the indefinitely</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.019" end="01:32:17.289" style="s2">large number of different observations</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.679" end="01:32:20.249" style="s2">of the game do not imply more than one</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.289" end="01:32:22.539" style="s2">game there&#39;s a lot more game than</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.249" end="01:32:24.699" style="s2">physics currently thinks is going on</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.539" end="01:32:27.959" style="s2">that&#39;s my belief all right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.699" end="01:32:30.669" style="s2">very cool and although I still feel like</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.959" end="01:32:32.979" style="s2">five minutes after our discussion is</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.669" end="01:32:34.359" style="s2">over I will begin to lose track of what</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.979" end="01:32:36.760" style="s2">I understand at this moment I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.359" end="01:32:38.229" style="s2">I&#39;m Way it&#39;s also just like this sucks</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.760" end="01:32:40.389" style="s2">because I&#39;ve always wanted to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.229" end="01:32:41.769" style="s2">you about what it is that I do and what</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.389" end="01:32:45.280" style="s2">it is that I think and like when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.769" end="01:32:46.899" style="s2">discovered something and the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.280" end="01:32:49.209" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand and maybe this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.899" end="01:32:53.589" style="s2">something I should ask you is I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.209" end="01:32:57.339" style="s2">about the complexity of like Seinfeld or</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.589" end="01:32:59.769" style="s2">The Sopranos or Game of Thrones or Harry</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.339" end="01:33:02.049" style="s2">Potter or the Lord of the Rings</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.769" end="01:33:04.209" style="s2">everybody remembers so many different</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.049" end="01:33:05.709" style="s2">pieces of information and when it comes</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.209" end="01:33:07.449" style="s2">to like particles they&#39;re like now dude</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.709" end="01:33:08.619" style="s2">that&#39;s so hard I&#39;m saying hey I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.449" end="01:33:10.360" style="s2">you the part of it that&#39;s hard and</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.619" end="01:33:12.219" style="s2">remembering that</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.360" end="01:33:15.880" style="s2">there&#39;s an electron a muon and the Tau</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.219" end="01:33:17.980" style="s2">particle is not the hard part no I get</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.880" end="01:33:20.560" style="s2">that I think there&#39;s something I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.980" end="01:33:25.270" style="s2">find it almost tragic because I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.560" end="01:33:26.770" style="s2">you are working you know I&#39;m not in a</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.270" end="01:33:30.699" style="s2">position to judge but I do have the</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.770" end="01:33:33.040" style="s2">sense that knowing you and knowing what</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.699" end="01:33:35.320" style="s2">you have sounded like over all of these</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.040" end="01:33:37.000" style="s2">decades as you&#39;ve worked on this I have</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.320" end="01:33:40.270" style="s2">the sense that you&#39;re very likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.000" end="01:33:42.280" style="s2">right right I would bet strongly in</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.270" end="01:33:43.869" style="s2">favor of you being right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.280" end="01:33:46.869" style="s2">interesting if that&#39;s true we should be</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.869" end="01:33:48.400" style="s2">able to make some money I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.869" end="01:33:50.260" style="s2">bet against it no but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.400" end="01:33:52.659" style="s2">interesting question right when you ask</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.260" end="01:33:54.489" style="s2">people to quantify just how like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.659" end="01:33:56.440" style="s2">very cheap for somebody say that bozo oh</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.489" end="01:33:58.110" style="s2">yeah like right he came up with</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.440" end="01:34:00.369" style="s2">something outside of the university haha</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.110" end="01:34:03.070" style="s2">okay it&#39;s like well quantify just how</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.369" end="01:34:04.480" style="s2">how ridiculous right is short are you</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.070" end="01:34:06.520" style="s2">ready short me at ten thousand to one</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.480" end="01:34:08.860" style="s2">odds right cuz like I&#39;ll put up a I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.520" end="01:34:09.940" style="s2">put I&#39;ll put a thousand bucks at ten</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.860" end="01:34:12.369" style="s2">thousand to one odds you are you</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.940" end="01:34:13.480" style="s2">interested sure no I it&#39;s it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.369" end="01:34:14.830" style="s2">it should be and for some reason the</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.480" end="01:34:16.480" style="s2">universe doesn&#39;t support this which</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.830" end="01:34:18.730" style="s2">indicates to people I don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.480" end="01:34:20.590" style="s2">for this nonsense right it&#39;s a quality</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.730" end="01:34:22.989" style="s2">control well they control it yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.590" end="01:34:24.820" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing I I do find there</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.989" end="01:34:27.400" style="s2">to be something tragic which is that I</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.820" end="01:34:29.770" style="s2">know that you have been adventuring on</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.400" end="01:34:32.469" style="s2">your own frontier for all of this time I</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.770" end="01:34:34.119" style="s2">know that you want company because I</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.469" end="01:34:36.369" style="s2">mean I have the same experiences that my</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.119" end="01:34:38.050" style="s2">frontier is easier right I can bring</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.369" end="01:34:39.460" style="s2">people to my frontier because we all</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.050" end="01:34:40.389" style="s2">have experience of the biota and it</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.460" end="01:34:42.250" style="s2">makes sense right</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.389" end="01:34:47.469" style="s2">I think the thing that you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.250" end="01:34:49.270" style="s2">remember yeah is how hard the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.469" end="01:34:52.600" style="s2">stuff is in this realm</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.270" end="01:34:56.080" style="s2">and it is not for lack of interest it is</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.600" end="01:34:57.940" style="s2">for the experience of getting nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.080" end="01:35:00.580" style="s2">right the experience of getting nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.940" end="01:35:05.110" style="s2">and the thing is we all have skills that</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.580" end="01:35:08.739" style="s2">look absolutely impossible I mean your</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.110" end="01:35:10.989" style="s2">Twitter feed reddit are full of people</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.739" end="01:35:12.580" style="s2">doing things that you would not think</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.989" end="01:35:14.260" style="s2">possible if you didn&#39;t have video</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.580" end="01:35:15.699" style="s2">evidence of the fact that some human</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.260" end="01:35:18.280" style="s2">being did it in front of a camera right</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.699" end="01:35:21.010" style="s2">and the thing is if you have even one of</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.280" end="01:35:23.619" style="s2">those skills mm-hmm then you also know</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.010" end="01:35:25.269" style="s2">that eh you couldn&#39;t describe</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.619" end="01:35:27.879" style="s2">to somebody else how you do it you could</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.269" end="01:35:29.409" style="s2">give them some insight maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.879" end="01:35:31.090" style="s2">some part of this which I actually just</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.409" end="01:35:38.079" style="s2">sort of relieved</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.090" end="01:35:40.689" style="s2">yeah which is I know that there are 20</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.079" end="01:35:42.399" style="s2">amino acids and I know that there are</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.689" end="01:35:45.659" style="s2">four nucleotides I know there&#39;s a sugar</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.399" end="01:35:49.169" style="s2">phosphate backbone yeah I know that I</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.659" end="01:35:53.699" style="s2">need heritability differential success</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.169" end="01:36:01.829" style="s2">in variation in order to generate like</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.699" end="01:36:01.829" style="s2">this stuff is on speed-dial right now</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.909" end="01:36:08.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not unspayed dial like I understand</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.169" end="01:36:10.189" style="s2">the really tough stuff yeah I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.599" end="01:36:14.360" style="s2">the Krebs cycle on speed dial</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.189" end="01:36:18.349" style="s2">yeah neither do i okay but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.360" end="01:36:20.090" style="s2">understand the extent to which people</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.349" end="01:36:25.939" style="s2">like when I when I showed the hopf</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.090" end="01:36:27.919" style="s2">fibration on Joe Rogan yeah there was a</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.939" end="01:36:30.559" style="s2">moment in which people were actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.919" end="01:36:33.320" style="s2">able to see a non-trivial principal</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.559" end="01:36:35.150" style="s2">fiber bundle and I said this is the most</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.320" end="01:36:37.729" style="s2">important object in the universe because</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.150" end="01:36:40.369" style="s2">it allows you to see the arena in which</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.729" end="01:36:43.309" style="s2">fundamental physics gets played so the</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.369" end="01:36:45.559" style="s2">basis of all reality takes place in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.309" end="01:36:47.570" style="s2">world of objects that look like this and</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.559" end="01:36:50.030" style="s2">here&#39;s the only one that you can</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.570" end="01:36:54.709" style="s2">actually fully see right yep</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.030" end="01:36:56.659" style="s2">and to me like if you told me this and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.709" end="01:37:00.260" style="s2">was doing anything else imagine I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.659" end="01:37:01.789" style="s2">cashier you could not have got me to</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.260" end="01:37:03.739" style="s2">stop thinking about that to the point</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.789" end="01:37:07.880" style="s2">that I actually understood right no I</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.739" end="01:37:08.989" style="s2">get this but what I think is not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.880" end="01:37:11.449" style="s2">and I mean look you&#39;re either gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.989" end="01:37:14.090" style="s2">my word for it or not is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.449" end="01:37:17.329" style="s2">something about the cognitive trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.090" end="01:37:19.969" style="s2">yeah I believe that this ship sailed for</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.329" end="01:37:23.570" style="s2">me a long time ago and it turned me into</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.969" end="01:37:25.550" style="s2">a kind of remote spectator of the sort</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.570" end="01:37:28.880" style="s2">of stuff you&#39;re talking about whereas if</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.550" end="01:37:31.039" style="s2">I walk into a tropical forest I start</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.880" end="01:37:32.929" style="s2">seeing stuff it pops at me right I know</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.039" end="01:37:34.579" style="s2">what to pay attention how to think about</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.929" end="01:37:36.559" style="s2">it I know what these pre try to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.579" end="01:37:40.519" style="s2">that you&#39;re in a tropical forest you see</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.559" end="01:37:42.949" style="s2">a bunch of small insects carrying what</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.519" end="01:37:48.050" style="s2">appeared to be parts of leaves that look</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.949" end="01:37:49.909" style="s2">like sales right okay yeah I if I came</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.050" end="01:37:52.219" style="s2">in there I would say whoa what do you</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.909" end="01:37:53.929" style="s2">know about these leafcutter ants if</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.219" end="01:37:56.900" style="s2">somebody else comes into physics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.929" end="01:37:58.669" style="s2">like dude I saw the craziest thing there</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.900" end="01:38:01.099" style="s2">were like six legs on them and they were</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.669" end="01:38:02.599" style="s2">carrying like sales I would say oh</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.099" end="01:38:03.829" style="s2">they&#39;re leaf cutter ants I would talk</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.599" end="01:38:06.619" style="s2">about leaf and then the person would</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.829" end="01:38:08.419" style="s2">come back and the next week they&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.619" end="01:38:10.459" style="s2">dude I saw this crazy thing there were</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.419" end="01:38:12.979" style="s2">six legs and they were carrying these</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.459" end="01:38:14.570" style="s2">pieces of leaves I would say we had this</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.979" end="01:38:15.420" style="s2">discussion we put our hands</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.570" end="01:38:17.580" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.420" end="01:38:18.960" style="s2">no I look I get it your your confusion</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.580" end="01:38:20.280" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on with the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.960" end="01:38:22.199" style="s2">us and it&#39;s not all of the rest of us</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.280" end="01:38:24.239" style="s2">but what some of the rest of us is well</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.199" end="01:38:26.010" style="s2">obviously organic so this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.239" end="01:38:29.040" style="s2">part of my confusion one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.010" end="01:38:31.260" style="s2">that we could also talk about is what is</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.040" end="01:38:36.150" style="s2">it like to see the rest of the world as</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.260" end="01:38:37.679" style="s2">crazy all the time so I&#39;m not sure where</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.150" end="01:38:39.060" style="s2">I fit in this analogy am I one of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.679" end="01:38:42.239" style="s2">crazy ones who doesn&#39;t get the half a</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.060" end="01:38:45.780" style="s2">physics half crazy okay so like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.239" end="01:38:48.660" style="s2">nothing in your brain that couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.780" end="01:38:51.600" style="s2">the one day investment in mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.660" end="01:38:54.540" style="s2">and mathematical physics to put you in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.600" end="01:38:56.219" style="s2">very strong position to understand what</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.540" end="01:38:57.810" style="s2">the problems are that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.219" end="01:38:59.370" style="s2">solve I would love that to be true I</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.810" end="01:39:01.170" style="s2">have a feeling it&#39;s false and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.370" end="01:39:04.650" style="s2">tell you why I think it&#39;s false okay</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.170" end="01:39:07.410" style="s2">okay I have a very beautiful guitar our</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.650" end="01:39:09.090" style="s2">grandfather got it for me many many</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.410" end="01:39:11.070" style="s2">years ago decades in fact really I just</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.090" end="01:39:12.690" style="s2">got a cheap one from Yamaha that he gave</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.070" end="01:39:15.030" style="s2">me so obviously loved you more yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.690" end="01:39:16.890" style="s2">well he desperately wanted me to have</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.030" end="01:39:19.590" style="s2">what you have has the ability to make</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.890" end="01:39:22.080" style="s2">music and I&#39;ve carried this thing every</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.590" end="01:39:24.330" style="s2">time I&#39;ve moved I&#39;ve lovingly packed it</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.080" end="01:39:26.910" style="s2">up yeah put it on the wall I&#39;ve taken I</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.330" end="01:39:29.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many lessons I have never</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.910" end="01:39:32.940" style="s2">gotten to the point where I can play a</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.640" end="01:39:34.020" style="s2">single song that sounds good to me and I</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.940" end="01:39:35.730" style="s2">have a feeling if I could get to that</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.020" end="01:39:38.820" style="s2">one thing and I&#39;ve even heard you say</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.730" end="01:39:40.860" style="s2">look you know if you tune the things to</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.820" end="01:39:42.630" style="s2">slide you can in a few hours yep you</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.860" end="01:39:43.469" style="s2">know I&#39;ve heard you say it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.630" end="01:39:46.199" style="s2">true okay</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.469" end="01:39:47.760" style="s2">okay and my point is I feel weird about</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.199" end="01:39:50.760" style="s2">this I actually feel ashamed about it</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.760" end="01:39:54.960" style="s2">because I so desperately want that thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.760" end="01:39:57.719" style="s2">and I do not have the module I clearly</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.960" end="01:40:00.179" style="s2">don&#39;t and it breaks my heart and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.719" end="01:40:03.510" style="s2">sort of gotten over it but the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.179" end="01:40:06.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay I&#39;m very good at English</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.510" end="01:40:07.890" style="s2">I&#39;m known to be good in English I do not</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.270" end="01:40:10.199" style="s2">have a gift for other languages I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.890" end="01:40:13.110" style="s2">tried I&#39;ve lived in Latin America and I</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.199" end="01:40:15.420" style="s2">have sucky Spanish that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.110" end="01:40:16.679" style="s2">enough so I can travel with it I can</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.420" end="01:40:19.410" style="s2">talk to people and I can have good</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.679" end="01:40:19.949" style="s2">conversations have you tried well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.410" end="01:40:25.469" style="s2">put it this way</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.949" end="01:40:27.150" style="s2">there&#39;s no level of not that good</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.469" end="01:40:28.760" style="s2">because I&#39;m at the wrong language but</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.150" end="01:40:30.140" style="s2">every Spanish had a reach</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.760" end="01:40:32.690" style="s2">Spanish should be in reach for me I</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.140" end="01:40:37.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know that in other words not a</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.690" end="01:40:39.830" style="s2">hard language sorry depends you know it</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.280" end="01:40:42.650" style="s2">really depends if you for example find</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.830" end="01:40:44.750" style="s2">the burden of grammatical gender to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.650" end="01:40:47.780" style="s2">very high just the way some people find</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.750" end="01:40:49.970" style="s2">to clefts to be too difficult for</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.780" end="01:40:51.710" style="s2">reading music one clef doesn&#39;t confuse</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.970" end="01:40:53.300" style="s2">them because they can learn it there</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.710" end="01:40:56.600" style="s2">might be an obstacle so what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.300" end="01:41:00.500" style="s2">to say is is that I know for example</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.600" end="01:41:05.239" style="s2">that you have not tried Malay or bus</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.500" end="01:41:07.730" style="s2">Indonesia which I know to be different</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.239" end="01:41:09.590" style="s2">character illogically from Spanish right</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.730" end="01:41:10.880" style="s2">look I&#39;m not disagreeing with that there</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.590" end="01:41:12.800" style="s2">may be a language out there that if I</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.880" end="01:41:14.510" style="s2">hit upon it boom and there might be an</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.800" end="01:41:16.340" style="s2">instrument out there or there might even</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.510" end="01:41:17.420" style="s2">be a technique at which I could approach</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.340" end="01:41:19.610" style="s2">the instrument I&#39;ve been trying to learn</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.420" end="01:41:21.800" style="s2">to play I wonder if I put stickers on</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.610" end="01:41:24.440" style="s2">your guitar and tune and show and bought</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.800" end="01:41:26.090" style="s2">you a tuner and then took five songs</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.440" end="01:41:28.120" style="s2">that you really liked and told you</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.090" end="01:41:31.489" style="s2">exactly which strings to pluck right</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.120" end="01:41:33.980" style="s2">maybe yeah maybe but what I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.489" end="01:41:36.590" style="s2">you is that the intuition of somebody</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.980" end="01:41:39.800" style="s2">who literally picked up the guitar and</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.590" end="01:41:41.000" style="s2">taught at home just to himself sat down</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.800" end="01:41:46.010" style="s2">at the piano and taught it to himself</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.000" end="01:41:47.780" style="s2">has learned passable useful parts of I</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.010" end="01:41:50.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know six languages or something</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.780" end="01:41:54.080" style="s2">like that your sense is that these</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.540" end="01:41:59.540" style="s2">things are over complicated by people my</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.080" end="01:42:01.520" style="s2">sense is that people confuse mastery for</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.540" end="01:42:04.270" style="s2">being reasonably well acquainted with</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.520" end="01:42:07.100" style="s2">something yeah and they are usually</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.270" end="01:42:09.739" style="s2">unwilling they are psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.100" end="01:42:11.120" style="s2">blocked when they are told that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.739" end="01:42:14.540" style="s2">something that they&#39;ve always wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.120" end="01:42:15.950" style="s2">do is within reach yeah an understanding</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.540" end="01:42:17.150" style="s2">that they have to go at about it</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.950" end="01:42:18.739" style="s2">slightly differently than they were</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.150" end="01:42:25.040" style="s2">expecting right but here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.739" end="01:42:29.810" style="s2">okay I have a table that I made no okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.040" end="01:42:32.450" style="s2">I am able to do this in my head I can</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.810" end="01:42:34.430" style="s2">figure out what I need to buy okay I can</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.450" end="01:42:36.170" style="s2">figure out how to deploy the tools I</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.430" end="01:42:39.020" style="s2">have even if I don&#39;t have the tools that</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.170" end="01:42:41.210" style="s2">would be optimal I can correct for</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.020" end="01:42:42.880" style="s2">errors that I didn&#39;t see coming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.210" end="01:42:46.809" style="s2">very intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.880" end="01:42:48.519" style="s2">and I know that it isn&#39;t that way for</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.809" end="01:42:51.429" style="s2">other people it just doesn&#39;t work that</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.519" end="01:42:53.949" style="s2">way so what I have forgotten and I have</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.429" end="01:42:56.739" style="s2">to remind myself of is that that</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.949" end="01:42:59.139" style="s2">intuition about how to do it is housed</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.739" end="01:43:00.010" style="s2">in someplace that I can&#39;t even access</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.139" end="01:43:02.019" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.010" end="01:43:03.190" style="s2">right I&#39;m conscious of what I&#39;m doing at</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.019" end="01:43:06.099" style="s2">one level I mean there&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.190" end="01:43:07.960" style="s2">level at which you know I can I can put</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.099" end="01:43:09.639" style="s2">together the table in one way in my head</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.960" end="01:43:11.199" style="s2">and I can sort of stress test it and see</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.639" end="01:43:13.570" style="s2">whether those joints are gonna work and</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.199" end="01:43:15.519" style="s2">I can refashion it it&#39;s not something it</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.570" end="01:43:18.099" style="s2">seems simple to me but it isn&#39;t simple</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.519" end="01:43:20.050" style="s2">likewise you know riding an electric</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.099" end="01:43:22.119" style="s2">unicycle and not falling off that was</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.050" end="01:43:23.889" style="s2">recent enough for me that I know how</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.119" end="01:43:25.739" style="s2">hard it is to get on that thing so</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.889" end="01:43:30.099" style="s2">explain something to me yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.739" end="01:43:32.110" style="s2">if I tell most people there are four</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.099" end="01:43:35.079" style="s2">forces they can&#39;t remember the four</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.110" end="01:43:36.780" style="s2">fundamental forces yeah but they will</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.079" end="01:43:40.949" style="s2">remember John Paul George and Ringo</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.780" end="01:43:44.199" style="s2">mm-hmm but this this is this parts easy</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.949" end="01:43:47.079" style="s2">some of us learn based on whether</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.199" end="01:43:50.499" style="s2">something sticks to something we already</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.079" end="01:43:54.579" style="s2">know right so forces isn&#39;t so hard</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.499" end="01:43:58.869" style="s2">because you know let&#39;s put it this way I</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.579" end="01:44:00.480" style="s2">suffered through enough chemistry and I</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.869" end="01:44:04.449" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say I suffered through physics</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.480" end="01:44:06.460" style="s2">but I had the material that I had to get</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.449" end="01:44:09.999" style="s2">through in order to go and study biology</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.460" end="01:44:14.139" style="s2">and those things interact with the</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.999" end="01:44:16.119" style="s2">forces in question right so I I have</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.139" end="01:44:18.849" style="s2">things that when we talk about those</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.119" end="01:44:21.789" style="s2">forces I can stick them on to and they</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.849" end="01:44:22.780" style="s2">last because it actually builds out what</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.789" end="01:44:24.460" style="s2">I&#39;m capable of</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.780" end="01:44:26.679" style="s2">in the case of the other stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.460" end="01:44:30.070" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about these things</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.679" end="01:44:31.690" style="s2">actually are like thought Islands right</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.070" end="01:44:33.699" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing near them</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.690" end="01:44:35.619" style="s2">right and you know sometimes you bridge</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.699" end="01:44:37.719" style="s2">this gap right you say ruler protractor</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.619" end="01:44:39.099" style="s2">rulers and protractors obviously those</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.719" end="01:44:41.559" style="s2">are things that exist for me and they</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.099" end="01:44:43.780" style="s2">have meaning because obviously you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.559" end="01:44:48.219" style="s2">hey when I do carpentry I&#39;m doing trig</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.780" end="01:44:51.190" style="s2">and so angles that&#39;s native to me but</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.219" end="01:44:53.769" style="s2">there are a lot of these islands of</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.190" end="01:44:56.350" style="s2">thought that are almost impossible for</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.769" end="01:44:59.140" style="s2">me to build</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.350" end="01:45:01.810" style="s2">then make it last because the brain</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.140" end="01:45:03.760" style="s2">takes apart that which isn&#39;t interacting</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.810" end="01:45:06.040" style="s2">with other things and so anyway this may</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.760" end="01:45:08.920" style="s2">be a defect of mine it may be a strength</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.040" end="01:45:10.870" style="s2">that has a cost I don&#39;t know but what</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.920" end="01:45:14.770" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you is that the experience</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.870" end="01:45:16.660" style="s2">of confronting the material and trying</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.770" end="01:45:23.650" style="s2">to acquire enough of it is not</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.660" end="01:45:26.350" style="s2">successful it&#39;s only reality my friend</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.650" end="01:45:29.320" style="s2">it is you&#39;re hardly the only person who</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.350" end="01:45:31.510" style="s2">suffers from this I think and this is</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.320" end="01:45:33.160" style="s2">the interesting part of it that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.510" end="01:45:37.300" style="s2">all crazy</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.160" end="01:45:41.590" style="s2">I find all of you completely insane and</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.300" end="01:45:44.890" style="s2">I can&#39;t express to you how frustrating</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.590" end="01:45:46.120" style="s2">it is alot bet that like people remember</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.890" end="01:45:47.890" style="s2">the Heisenberg uncertainty principle</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.120" end="01:45:53.530" style="s2">they remember that Schrodinger is</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.890" end="01:45:57.070" style="s2">fucking cat and if you say muon it</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.530" end="01:45:58.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t stick the cat the double slit</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.070" end="01:45:59.650" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s they want to know about</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.540" end="01:46:01.300" style="s2">entangle they want to know about many</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.650" end="01:46:05.080" style="s2">worlds they can&#39;t remember that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.300" end="01:46:06.850" style="s2">a muon or for example you know they say</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.080" end="01:46:09.310" style="s2">well we&#39;re carbon-based life-forms so I</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.850" end="01:46:11.170" style="s2">say okay in a carbon atom you got a</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.310" end="01:46:12.730" style="s2">bunch of protons and neutrons stuck</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.170" end="01:46:14.860" style="s2">together tell me something what do like</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.730" end="01:46:15.100" style="s2">charges do when they&#39;re very close to</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.860" end="01:46:17.830" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.100" end="01:46:20.650" style="s2">oh they repel okay well why am I not</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.830" end="01:46:23.610" style="s2">exploding and obliterating you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.650" end="01:46:29.130" style="s2">know why not</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.610" end="01:46:29.130" style="s2">something about the strong force yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.580" end="01:46:37.450" style="s2">don&#39;t grasp this I don&#39;t understand like</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.500" end="01:46:40.150" style="s2">right now you&#39;re seated in a chair yep</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.450" end="01:46:43.980" style="s2">gravity you can see me yeah</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.150" end="01:46:46.540" style="s2">electromagnetism I don&#39;t blow you up</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.980" end="01:46:48.610" style="s2">strong force yeah that&#39;s three out of</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.540" end="01:46:51.940" style="s2">four forces just for us to have this</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.610" end="01:46:54.700" style="s2">conversation yeah if there&#39;s then if I</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.940" end="01:46:55.450" style="s2">say to you name members of The Rolling</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.700" end="01:46:57.460" style="s2">Stones</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.450" end="01:46:59.530" style="s2">you&#39;ll name more members of the Rolling</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.460" end="01:47:01.420" style="s2">Stone than then you can name forces or</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.530" end="01:47:03.760" style="s2">particles or anything it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.420" end="01:47:05.620" style="s2">very weird that people have decided that</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.760" end="01:47:09.430" style="s2">they&#39;re blocked because I can tell that</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.620" end="01:47:10.239" style="s2">the data needed to store this is so</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.430" end="01:47:13.120" style="s2">slight</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.239" end="01:47:16.239" style="s2">oh you think it is I know you think it</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.120" end="01:47:17.920" style="s2">is but what you don&#39;t understand you</p>

<p begin="01:47:26.410" end="01:47:31.270" style="s2">it because frustration and an object</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.900" end="01:47:33.130" style="s2">that requires that I take delicate care</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.270" end="01:47:35.680" style="s2">of it that follows me from one state to</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.130" end="01:47:37.360" style="s2">the other right it&#39;s not a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.680" end="01:47:39.160" style="s2">desire to play the guitar it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.360" end="01:47:40.600" style="s2">lack of desire to understand what it is</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.160" end="01:47:42.489" style="s2">that you do to in the guitar you have a</p>

<p begin="01:49:46.350" end="01:49:51.090" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna kick myself hope so why didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.750" end="01:49:55.900" style="s2">I do this at 20</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.090" end="01:49:57.159" style="s2">I&#39;ve been available my number it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.900" end="01:49:58.960" style="s2">like I haven&#39;t asked you and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.159" end="01:50:01.239" style="s2">actually sat down to do it it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.960" end="01:50:03.190" style="s2">worked so maybe maybe you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.239" end="01:50:04.600" style="s2">better method or maybe I&#39;m more mature</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.190" end="01:50:08.409" style="s2">and can handle what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.600" end="01:50:09.760" style="s2">tell me but there is something where you</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.409" end="01:50:11.500" style="s2">know I mean look it&#39;s just trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.760" end="01:50:13.420" style="s2">man it&#39;s a trade-off so I&#39;m really good</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.500" end="01:50:14.739" style="s2">at some stuff in it got some weird cost</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.420" end="01:50:16.690" style="s2">there are things that I&#39;m not good at</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.739" end="01:50:18.640" style="s2">for example when I tried to read the</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.690" end="01:50:20.679" style="s2">Lord of the Rings I got completely</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.640" end="01:50:23.320" style="s2">thrown by the number of names and places</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.679" end="01:50:26.710" style="s2">and characters I didn&#39;t care anything</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.320" end="01:50:28.060" style="s2">about totally turned me off yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.710" end="01:50:29.710" style="s2">that there may be things that turn you</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.060" end="01:50:30.670" style="s2">off in this process I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.710" end="01:50:33.250" style="s2">you weren&#39;t blocked</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.670" end="01:50:35.710" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that there are situations in</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.250" end="01:50:37.030" style="s2">which you&#39;re trying to tell Ray Charles</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.710" end="01:50:38.679" style="s2">would you look at the beauty of this</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.030" end="01:50:40.420" style="s2">painting and he&#39;s like I&#39;m not getting</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.679" end="01:50:42.370" style="s2">it and you&#39;re not getting these blind</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.420" end="01:50:44.860" style="s2">right so there are there are real</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.370" end="01:50:47.260" style="s2">blockages yeah then there are imaginary</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.860" end="01:50:48.730" style="s2">blockages where you&#39;re like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.260" end="01:50:50.320" style="s2">saying oh my god I&#39;m blind and</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.730" end="01:50:52.900" style="s2">somebody&#39;s saying like okay just open</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.320" end="01:50:55.510" style="s2">your eyes oh oh this is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.900" end="01:50:58.179" style="s2">okay no actually I like this because</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.510" end="01:50:59.650" style="s2">undoubtedly yeah undoubtedly the things</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.179" end="01:51:01.150" style="s2">that blocked me are a mixture of these</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.650" end="01:51:04.000" style="s2">two things right right there are some</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.150" end="01:51:05.140" style="s2">real blocks that may be impenetrable and</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.000" end="01:51:07.449" style="s2">there are some other blocks that are</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.140" end="01:51:09.310" style="s2">just my giving up too early right and</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.449" end="01:51:11.409" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to disentangle them</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.310" end="01:51:14.020" style="s2">because from my perspective they feel</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.409" end="01:51:16.060" style="s2">alike they&#39;d all feel like impenetrable</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.020" end="01:51:20.590" style="s2">blocks all I&#39;m trying to suggest is that</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.060" end="01:51:22.449" style="s2">the there are things in physics that are</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.590" end="01:51:24.159" style="s2">very difficult to do that are very</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.449" end="01:51:27.929" style="s2">frustrating and I can I can empathize</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.159" end="01:51:31.570" style="s2">with the issue that that these things</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.929" end="01:51:34.659" style="s2">create problems and blockages people</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.570" end="01:51:36.280" style="s2">then invoke that to talk about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.659" end="01:51:37.360" style="s2">that even though they&#39;re super curious</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.280" end="01:51:38.770" style="s2">about Heisenberg&#39;s answer</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.360" end="01:51:40.030" style="s2">any principle and the measurement</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.770" end="01:51:42.550" style="s2">problem and something they heard about</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.030" end="01:51:44.980" style="s2">many worlds they don&#39;t know the first</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.550" end="01:51:46.690" style="s2">thing about what is the stuff that our</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.980" end="01:51:49.540" style="s2">world is made of just like the laundry</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.690" end="01:51:50.889" style="s2">list so you know there&#39;s Hamlet to play</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.540" end="01:51:52.540" style="s2">and the beauty of the English language</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.889" end="01:51:55.350" style="s2">and whether or not one understands every</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.540" end="01:52:00.600" style="s2">sentence there&#39;s also just a question of</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.350" end="01:52:03.670" style="s2">you know are you aware that a philia and</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.600" end="01:52:05.560" style="s2">Hamlet are in the same play but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.670" end="01:52:06.670" style="s2">the thing this is this is a good example</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.560" end="01:52:09.040" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.670" end="01:52:11.710" style="s2">you have taught me that stuff okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.040" end="01:52:13.239" style="s2">and it did sort of stick enough that</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.710" end="01:52:14.860" style="s2">it&#39;s actually in one of the lectures</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.239" end="01:52:16.090" style="s2">that I used to deliver to my students</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.860" end="01:52:17.770" style="s2">okay where I showed them the</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.090" end="01:52:22.389" style="s2">fundamentals the fermions and the bosons</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.770" end="01:52:24.520" style="s2">etc I have lost track I actually at this</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.389" end="01:52:26.350" style="s2">moment couldn&#39;t distinguish between I</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.520" end="01:52:28.420" style="s2">know that one of these things is forces</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.350" end="01:52:30.070" style="s2">and one of these things as objects but I</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.420" end="01:52:32.650" style="s2">couldn&#39;t remember which is which and the</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.070" end="01:52:33.429" style="s2">reason for that is because in the</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.650" end="01:52:35.260" style="s2">learning process</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.429" end="01:52:38.350" style="s2">this particular piece of knowledge does</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.260" end="01:52:40.449" style="s2">not get reinforced so even though I had</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.350" end="01:52:42.340" style="s2">it at one time enough to teach it to</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.449" end="01:52:44.889" style="s2">people who hadn&#39;t heard it I have now</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.340" end="01:52:47.560" style="s2">lost it it&#39;s gone okay now would it be</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.889" end="01:52:49.270" style="s2">easy for me to you know to get back to</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.560" end="01:52:52.230" style="s2">it sure it would just take a little</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.270" end="01:52:56.050" style="s2">refresher but you&#39;ve got a durable</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.230" end="01:52:57.880" style="s2">heuristic like for example fermions we</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.050" end="01:52:59.230" style="s2">have a Fermi paradox which people know</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.880" end="01:53:00.909" style="s2">about which is why don&#39;t we know about</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.230" end="01:53:02.710" style="s2">anybody else in the universe yeah</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.909" end="01:53:03.940" style="s2">well those alien beings would be made of</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.710" end="01:53:05.980" style="s2">matter so maybe the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.940" end="01:53:07.929" style="s2">fermions are made of matt cool okay so</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.980" end="01:53:10.030" style="s2">that&#39;s an it&#39;s like a little sticky</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.929" end="01:53:12.219" style="s2">thing and then you could say right oh</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.030" end="01:53:14.290" style="s2">shoot or is it boughs of the clown</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.219" end="01:53:15.820" style="s2">because he&#39;s a boson and bozos made it</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.290" end="01:53:19.540" style="s2">matter now I&#39;ve confused myself again</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.820" end="01:53:21.850" style="s2">right all right I get it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.540" end="01:53:25.660" style="s2">know I guess look I&#39;ll be honest there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.850" end="01:53:26.850" style="s2">a sadness that I have which is that I</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.660" end="01:53:29.710" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.850" end="01:53:34.900" style="s2">guess I get to visit everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.710" end="01:53:36.790" style="s2">field and people give all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.900" end="01:53:38.530" style="s2">reasons why they&#39;re super interested in</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.790" end="01:53:40.719" style="s2">things that I care about without ever</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.530" end="01:53:42.250" style="s2">wanting to make the trek and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.719" end="01:53:46.030" style="s2">like a little bit what I saw with the</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.250" end="01:53:48.369" style="s2">geometric unity stuff when I released</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.030" end="01:53:50.380" style="s2">episode 19 which was the episode with</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.369" end="01:53:51.219" style="s2">you about telomeres and the Grider</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.380" end="01:53:53.650" style="s2">laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.219" end="01:53:56.440" style="s2">the interaction between you and the</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.650" end="01:53:59.440" style="s2">Grider laboratory with respect to the</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.440" end="01:54:02.350" style="s2">prediction that laboratory mice would be</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.440" end="01:54:04.949" style="s2">the ones with ultra elongated telomeres</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.350" end="01:54:10.360" style="s2">and not mice in general having yeah</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.949" end="01:54:13.180" style="s2">people loved the story and that story</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.360" end="01:54:16.330" style="s2">stuck to their ribs I have people coming</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.180" end="01:54:22.150" style="s2">up to me about that story when it comes</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.330" end="01:54:25.180" style="s2">to let&#39;s say geometric unity I said lots</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.150" end="01:54:28.090" style="s2">of things that were quite explicit and</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.180" end="01:54:29.440" style="s2">it&#39;s been fascinating to see people</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.090" end="01:54:31.120" style="s2">saying well he didn&#39;t write a paper so</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.440" end="01:54:33.460" style="s2">he can&#39;t have any idea what he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.120" end="01:54:37.449" style="s2">which is nonsense complete nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.460" end="01:54:39.520" style="s2">mm-hmm I believe that yeah I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.449" end="01:54:42.460" style="s2">saying that part of the problem is is</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.520" end="01:54:44.800" style="s2">that the world has such an inferiority</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.460" end="01:54:48.190" style="s2">complex about physics and math it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.800" end="01:54:49.660" style="s2">the sum total of every middle-school</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.190" end="01:54:51.489" style="s2">teacher in high school teacher who</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.660" end="01:54:53.230" style="s2">convinced people that they sucked at</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.489" end="01:54:56.140" style="s2">this thing which is a universal human</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.230" end="01:54:58.420" style="s2">birthright is that we&#39;ve got a planet</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.140" end="01:55:00.130" style="s2">that is traumatized by mathematics and</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.420" end="01:55:01.570" style="s2">anything that has the threat that it</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.130" end="01:55:03.190" style="s2">could become math or that we will be</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.570" end="01:55:05.680" style="s2">asked what can you compute this</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.190" end="01:55:08.160" style="s2">determinant of this matrix I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.680" end="01:55:11.320" style="s2">remember the formula for determined okay</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.160" end="01:55:13.239" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re talking about universal human</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.320" end="01:55:16.750" style="s2">trauma with several exceptions who are</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.239" end="01:55:19.120" style="s2">the mathematicians and physicists yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.750" end="01:55:22.390" style="s2">believe that and you know I deal with a</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.120" end="01:55:26.110" style="s2">much more mundane version of this which</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.390" end="01:55:28.360" style="s2">is whether or not you think you care</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.110" end="01:55:30.400" style="s2">about biology or are any good at</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.360" end="01:55:31.840" style="s2">thinking about it has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.400" end="01:55:33.520" style="s2">whether or not you had a lame-ass</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.840" end="01:55:34.989" style="s2">biology teacher who did force you to</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.520" end="01:55:37.449" style="s2">learn the krebs cycle for no good reason</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.989" end="01:55:40.570" style="s2">right so a lot of people have biology</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.449" end="01:55:42.820" style="s2">trauma over stuff they didn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.570" end="01:55:44.320" style="s2">learn in the first place and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.820" end="01:55:46.420" style="s2">in the classroom one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.320" end="01:55:48.010" style="s2">I did was try to convince people who</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.420" end="01:55:49.420" style="s2">thought they had no interest in this</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.010" end="01:55:51.520" style="s2">thing that everything they cared about</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.420" end="01:55:52.630" style="s2">depended on it and that it wasn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.520" end="01:55:54.940" style="s2">hard as people were making it out to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.630" end="01:55:57.969" style="s2">so I know I&#39;ve sat in your chair I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.940" end="01:55:59.410" style="s2">given the speech but having given us</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.969" end="01:56:01.420" style="s2">well you haven&#39;t sat in my class</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.410" end="01:56:03.400" style="s2">obviously this is the sad part yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.420" end="01:56:05.260" style="s2">you know what&#39;s actually going on no</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.400" end="01:56:07.510" style="s2">idea I mean literally I am so</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.260" end="01:56:10.150" style="s2">mystified right by the asymmetry am i</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.510" end="01:56:14.050" style="s2">right we&#39;ve done better today than prior</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.150" end="01:56:16.630" style="s2">instances that we&#39;ve done 45 minutes an</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.050" end="01:56:18.699" style="s2">hour&#39;s worth of I&#39;m not sure I honestly</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.630" end="01:56:20.590" style="s2">I have that sense all right but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.699" end="01:56:23.050" style="s2">what I think happens okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.590" end="01:56:24.820" style="s2">something about this environment the</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.050" end="01:56:26.349" style="s2">fact that you and I are talking together</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.820" end="01:56:28.480" style="s2">with some awareness that other people</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.349" end="01:56:32.760" style="s2">are going to see it the change is the</p>

<p begin="02:03:29.350" end="02:03:34.360" style="s2">reasonable but the world told him that</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.470" end="02:03:37.930" style="s2">he was a lunatic for saying real things</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.360" end="02:03:41.470" style="s2">and that started a process in his mind</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.930" end="02:03:43.360" style="s2">where he didn&#39;t understand that in</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.470" end="02:03:46.720" style="s2">trying to prove that he wasn&#39;t a lunatic</p>

<p begin="02:03:50.830" end="02:03:55.860" style="s2">understanding than simply saying hey</p>

<p begin="02:08:06.410" end="02:08:09.080" style="s2">then I have the idea of the</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.820" end="02:08:12.980" style="s2">intersectional answer that oh is he</p>

<p begin="02:09:38.900" end="02:09:43.699" style="s2">Stearns yeah and somehow the cool kids</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.630" end="02:09:45.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t know to freak out until much</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.699" end="02:09:48.860" style="s2">later well the same thing happened in</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.260" end="02:09:50.840" style="s2">physics right so the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.860" end="02:09:53.300" style="s2">dumb physicists which included Sheldon</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.840" end="02:09:54.770" style="s2">Glashow Nobel Prize winner and Richard</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.300" end="02:09:56.000" style="s2">Fineman and a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.770" end="02:09:58.820" style="s2">people who didn&#39;t go in for string</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.000" end="02:10:01.160" style="s2">theory like you don&#39;t get the problem</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.820" end="02:10:04.429" style="s2">with string theory you know I was like</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.160" end="02:10:06.230" style="s2">are you kidding you&#39;re a child you know</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.429" end="02:10:07.820" style="s2">and so the idea is that the smart kids</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.230" end="02:10:10.699" style="s2">understood the string theory was gonna</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.820" end="02:10:13.070" style="s2">be fine and then when string theory</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.699" end="02:10:15.230" style="s2">finally got to issues about you know the</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.070" end="02:10:17.030" style="s2">landscape and too many vacuo and all</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.230" end="02:10:20.480" style="s2">this stuff they&#39;re like oh my god we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.030" end="02:10:23.510" style="s2">got a problem with string theory now why</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.480" end="02:10:25.340" style="s2">is it when the cool kids wake up that</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.510" end="02:10:27.770" style="s2">there&#39;s still the smart kids right why</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.340" end="02:10:31.420" style="s2">you made this point to me decades ago</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.770" end="02:10:34.730" style="s2">which is that there is a degree of</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.420" end="02:10:36.469" style="s2">earliness in which we never vindicate</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.730" end="02:10:38.179" style="s2">the people who actually had it right</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.469" end="02:10:39.620" style="s2">even though those are the voices that</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.179" end="02:10:41.570" style="s2">are the most interesting getting it</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.620" end="02:10:43.670" style="s2">right just before because you wave for</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.570" end="02:10:46.160" style="s2">guaranteed when somebody gets it right</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.670" end="02:10:48.520" style="s2">too early the danger is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.160" end="02:10:50.960" style="s2">thinking for themselves mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.520" end="02:10:52.670" style="s2">right and when somebody&#39;s thinking for</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.960" end="02:10:55.340" style="s2">themselves it means that you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.670" end="02:10:57.140" style="s2">them to sign up for the next</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.340" end="02:10:59.300" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna salute your flag when</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.140" end="02:11:00.830" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to salute your flag for</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.300" end="02:11:02.840" style="s2">the next flag that gets run up the</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.830" end="02:11:06.260" style="s2">flagpole right and so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.840" end="02:11:09.380" style="s2">you never win weirdly when you&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.260" end="02:11:12.110" style="s2">early you knee up to be you know like</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.380" end="02:11:13.940" style="s2">mad at Glacia so say you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.110" end="02:11:17.239" style="s2">possible that this isn&#39;t just confined</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.940" end="02:11:18.620" style="s2">to university campus yeah how</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.239" end="02:11:20.840" style="s2">interesting are you saying that things</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.620" end="02:11:24.130" style="s2">taught at university can actually spread</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.840" end="02:11:26.960" style="s2">outside of university yes I am saying</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.130" end="02:11:30.230" style="s2">good very well Diane welcome let the</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.960" end="02:11:32.690" style="s2">other people at Vox know yes no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.230" end="02:11:34.150" style="s2">exactly that and you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.690" end="02:11:37.550" style="s2">trying to make this point about</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.150" end="02:11:39.139" style="s2">the fact that all these failures that</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.550" end="02:11:41.599" style="s2">don&#39;t look at all alike they all look</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.139" end="02:11:43.010" style="s2">individual are really the same</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.599" end="02:11:44.420" style="s2">phenomenon and that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.010" end="02:11:46.190" style="s2">telling us something about how to think</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.420" end="02:11:48.710" style="s2">about such a phenomenon so you know</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.190" end="02:11:50.449" style="s2">you&#39;ve got deepwater horizon you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.710" end="02:11:52.579" style="s2">the financial collapse of 2008</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.449" end="02:11:56.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got Fukushima you got Aliso</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.579" end="02:11:59.719" style="s2">Canyon cover that you&#39;ve got covin 19</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.480" end="02:12:02.269" style="s2">and the probable lab leak that caused it</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.719" end="02:12:05.659" style="s2">all of these things caused me now to</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.269" end="02:12:08.030" style="s2">think okay I discover that some process</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.659" end="02:12:10.670" style="s2">is afoot in the world right that is an</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.030" end="02:12:13.639" style="s2">existential threat something goes wrong</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.670" end="02:12:16.280" style="s2">that&#39;s very very bad but not nearly as</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.639" end="02:12:18.829" style="s2">bad as it could have been right and so</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.280" end="02:12:20.989" style="s2">we get lucky in all of these cases even</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.829" end="02:12:23.809" style="s2">the worst of them we got luckily so far</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.989" end="02:12:25.960" style="s2">so far and you can just extrapolate the</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.809" end="02:12:29.719" style="s2">point is you&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.960" end="02:12:31.909" style="s2">distribution of catastrophes yes and we</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.719" end="02:12:33.289" style="s2">are able to infer with the number of</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.909" end="02:12:35.170" style="s2">these catastrophes we&#39;ve had we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.289" end="02:12:38.630" style="s2">to infer the tale that you must survive</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.170" end="02:12:41.599" style="s2">because and this is look this is the</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.630" end="02:12:45.949" style="s2">hardest thing that I&#39;ve had to do which</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.599" end="02:12:50.320" style="s2">is to say we have a universal problem</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.949" end="02:12:53.690" style="s2">with institutions and expertise that is</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.320" end="02:12:57.380" style="s2">essentially everywhere yes and it has</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.690" end="02:12:59.659" style="s2">one source and that one source is that</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.380" end="02:13:02.869" style="s2">when you are not growing but your entire</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.659" end="02:13:06.619" style="s2">society is built on growth every</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.869" end="02:13:09.050" style="s2">institution will select for a wire to</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.619" end="02:13:11.719" style="s2">claim that that&#39;s institution is fine</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.050" end="02:13:14.329" style="s2">and should be kept afloat yeah right</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.719" end="02:13:15.769" style="s2">like the idea is somebody says you know</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.329" end="02:13:17.090" style="s2">in this department we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.769" end="02:13:19.489" style="s2">doing anything we haven&#39;t done anything</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.090" end="02:13:20.960" style="s2">for a number of years I think what</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.489" end="02:13:22.760" style="s2">should probably happen is that I should</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.960" end="02:13:25.550" style="s2">retire I should get my colleagues to</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.760" end="02:13:27.409" style="s2">retire and we should hire a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.550" end="02:13:30.289" style="s2">people who are hostile to the ideas that</p>
<p begin="02:13:27.409" end="02:13:32.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve spent the last 15 years on right</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.289" end="02:13:34.340" style="s2">like each does not exist that speech</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.300" end="02:13:36.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t while it may exist there may be</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.340" end="02:13:39.260" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that nobody&#39;s ever given</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.170" end="02:13:42.079" style="s2">it right like Eisenhower on his way out</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.260" end="02:13:45.860" style="s2">says beware the military steals oh my</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.079" end="02:13:47.479" style="s2">boot peace out folks okay so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.860" end="02:13:54.739" style="s2">mic drop of Eisenhower yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.479" end="02:13:58.219" style="s2">but well what I believe is we have all</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.739" end="02:14:00.320" style="s2">the wrong experts every single person</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.219" end="02:14:02.780" style="s2">who&#39;s risen to the top of this system</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.320" end="02:14:07.400" style="s2">should be expected unless their name is</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.780" end="02:14:09.289" style="s2">Ralph Connery to be corrupt mm-hmm like</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.400" end="02:14:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s almost that bad maybe the</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.289" end="02:14:13.369" style="s2">University at we ha go we have maybe we</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.360" end="02:14:15.050" style="s2">have an expertise generating function</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.369" end="02:14:16.489" style="s2">that selects for corruptness and then</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.050" end="02:14:18.170" style="s2">we&#39;re shocked that all of these things</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.489" end="02:14:22.510" style="s2">are failing off boy did you see this</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.170" end="02:14:26.150" style="s2">pouchy thing the other Bentham asks so I</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.510" end="02:14:29.329" style="s2">specifically said copiously everywhere</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.150" end="02:14:31.309" style="s2">everywhere we are destroying the</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.329" end="02:14:34.729" style="s2">credibility in science by pretending</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.309" end="02:14:36.170" style="s2">that our problem to stock masks and</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.729" end="02:14:38.929" style="s2">personal protective equipment is</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.170" end="02:14:42.289" style="s2">actually the failure of masks to be</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.929" end="02:14:44.389" style="s2">efficacious in stopping the spread of</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.289" end="02:14:47.809" style="s2">this disease yeah I remember your exact</p>
<p begin="02:14:44.389" end="02:14:49.550" style="s2">phraseology was what are the chances</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.809" end="02:14:51.380" style="s2">that masks would not be at least</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.550" end="02:14:54.019" style="s2">somewhat effective right in preventing</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.380" end="02:14:56.510" style="s2">the spread and foul she says yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.019" end="02:14:58.760" style="s2">why we did it I&#39;m just saying like okay</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.510" end="02:15:00.530" style="s2">great time to lose your job and retire</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.760" end="02:15:01.849" style="s2">from public life yes time for you to</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.530" end="02:15:04.130" style="s2">lose your job and it&#39;s time for the rest</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.849" end="02:15:06.349" style="s2">of us to go back to a tweet stream that</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.130" end="02:15:08.719" style="s2">is only months old and say who got this</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.349" end="02:15:11.889" style="s2">right let&#39;s let&#39;s take the totality of</p>
<p begin="02:15:08.719" end="02:15:16.039" style="s2">people who were able to see the obvious</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.889" end="02:15:17.929" style="s2">right right including this is going to</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.039" end="02:15:21.499" style="s2">turn out to have been widely considered</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.929" end="02:15:24.110" style="s2">to be the Wuhan lab yes of course</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.499" end="02:15:25.849" style="s2">and everybody in officialdom is lying</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.110" end="02:15:27.320" style="s2">and they should lose their jobs they</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.849" end="02:15:29.329" style="s2">should lose their jobs the people who</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.320" end="02:15:30.889" style="s2">got it right so that&#39;s the problem is</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.329" end="02:15:32.840" style="s2">you can edit down you know how many</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.889" end="02:15:34.159" style="s2">people got this thing right and the</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.840" end="02:15:35.420" style="s2">point is well well but I get it right</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.159" end="02:15:38.300" style="s2">let&#39;s be very clear about yeah</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.420" end="02:15:39.979" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean to predict like this</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.300" end="02:15:43.039" style="s2">definitely came from the Wuhan lab yeah</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.979" end="02:15:44.900" style="s2">we don&#39;t know that okay because the</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.039" end="02:15:47.749" style="s2">claim is the people who think this came</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.900" end="02:15:52.159" style="s2">from the Wuhan lab are lunatics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.749" end="02:15:54.590" style="s2">anti Chinese yep the bigots did this to</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.159" end="02:15:58.550" style="s2">that like okay shut the fuck up</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.590" end="02:16:00.320" style="s2">first of all yeah shut the fuck up let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.550" end="02:16:01.190" style="s2">look at the group of people who stood up</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.320" end="02:16:05.150" style="s2">and will</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.190" end="02:16:05.960" style="s2">to be your pretend bigots you bigots you</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.150" end="02:16:08.330" style="s2">bastards</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.960" end="02:16:10.520" style="s2">sons of bitches it is time for you all</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.330" end="02:16:13.730" style="s2">to lose your jobs to the people who</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.520" end="02:16:15.380" style="s2">actually stood up and not only called</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.730" end="02:16:17.980" style="s2">the fact that this was an important</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.380" end="02:16:21.380" style="s2">consideration but said so in public</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.980" end="02:16:24.110" style="s2">against the juggernaut of your</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.380" end="02:16:26.450" style="s2">wall-to-wall defense of our involvement</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.110" end="02:16:29.480" style="s2">with this goddamn Wuhan Lab but what the</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.450" end="02:16:31.220" style="s2">hell is our situation with China is that</p>
<p begin="02:16:29.480" end="02:16:34.160" style="s2">most of the people driving a luxury</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.220" end="02:16:36.830" style="s2">automobile had a lot of their money come</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.160" end="02:16:38.780" style="s2">from China in one form or another we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:16:36.830" end="02:16:40.250" style="s2">got a bunch of Americans who are not</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.780" end="02:16:41.750" style="s2">fundamentally interested in the American</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.250" end="02:16:44.630" style="s2">project they&#39;re interested in their</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.750" end="02:16:46.429" style="s2">second home or you know we&#39;re sending</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.630" end="02:16:50.540" style="s2">their third kid through college or</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.429" end="02:16:53.380" style="s2">whatever and those people are addicted</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.540" end="02:16:55.910" style="s2">to China they want to do China the way</p>
<p begin="02:16:53.380" end="02:16:58.100" style="s2">you know jazz musicians used to do</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.910" end="02:17:00.830" style="s2">heroin it&#39;s essential for their being</p>
<p begin="02:16:58.100" end="02:17:03.200" style="s2">able to function yeah and it&#39;s a gamble</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.830" end="02:17:05.929" style="s2">they have gambled all of our futures</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.200" end="02:17:08.900" style="s2">that gambled the West on a belief that</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.929" end="02:17:11.360" style="s2">China will be obligated by its need for</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.900" end="02:17:14.120" style="s2">us as a market to function as we will</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.360" end="02:17:16.070" style="s2">make China a better China by</p>
<p begin="02:17:14.120" end="02:17:17.600" style="s2">constructive engagement which means that</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.070" end="02:17:19.310" style="s2">I will have a third home with a swimming</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.600" end="02:17:19.760" style="s2">pool yeah and it&#39;s all a rationalization</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.310" end="02:17:22.130" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.760" end="02:17:24.230" style="s2">and so if you edit down the world if you</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.130" end="02:17:26.240" style="s2">say okay here&#39;s the entire population of</p>
<p begin="02:17:24.230" end="02:17:29.570" style="s2">you know by the way you and I probably</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.240" end="02:17:32.600" style="s2">have some percentage of our net worth</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.570" end="02:17:35.360" style="s2">that comes from jobs from China right my</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.600" end="02:17:37.820" style="s2">feeling is I don&#39;t want it I&#39;d rather be</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.360" end="02:17:39.590" style="s2">poorer and not be dependent on whoever</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.820" end="02:17:41.540" style="s2">it was who massacred students in</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.590" end="02:17:44.179" style="s2">Tiananmen Square . well it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.540" end="02:17:47.380" style="s2">bit like the way evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.179" end="02:17:49.760" style="s2">has been disrupted by our belief that</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.380" end="02:17:51.679" style="s2">reproductive success and fitness are</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.760" end="02:17:52.969" style="s2">actually the same thing they&#39;re closely</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.679" end="02:17:57.679" style="s2">related right</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.969" end="02:17:59.750" style="s2">but being better off being wealthier is</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.679" end="02:18:02.230" style="s2">not the same thing as being a richer and</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.750" end="02:18:04.370" style="s2">so yes of course we would surrender a</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.230" end="02:18:07.940" style="s2">substantial fraction of our wealth not</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.370" end="02:18:10.640" style="s2">to have the gamble of being so dependent</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.940" end="02:18:12.620" style="s2">on a nation that is so clearly hostile</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.640" end="02:18:14.630" style="s2">to us at the level of fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.620" end="02:18:17.240" style="s2">interests I would rather live on</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.630" end="02:18:19.610" style="s2">and beans with an ability to think</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.240" end="02:18:22.070" style="s2">freely and not have to parrot some</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.610" end="02:18:25.399" style="s2">stupid-ass shit in order to keep my job</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.070" end="02:18:26.990" style="s2">yeah right I really would rather have</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.399" end="02:18:29.030" style="s2">rice and beans and if you would rather</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.990" end="02:18:32.389" style="s2">have a luxury automobile and lied for a</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.030" end="02:18:34.189" style="s2">living then we need a divorce yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.389" end="02:18:36.050" style="s2">I absolutely absolutely agree with this</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.189" end="02:18:37.370" style="s2">and now you know I&#39;m not exactly sure</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.050" end="02:18:40.219" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing in our streets because</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.370" end="02:18:42.679" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure that anybody who is</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.219" end="02:18:46.429" style="s2">hostile to our long-term well-being and</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.679" end="02:18:49.700" style="s2">strength is certain to be happy about</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.429" end="02:18:52.219" style="s2">the lunacy that is now threatening us</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.700" end="02:18:54.590" style="s2">and so what I can&#39;t see is any reason</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.219" end="02:18:58.460" style="s2">that they would not be attempting to</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.590" end="02:19:05.059" style="s2">amplify it and the tools to do so would</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.460" end="02:19:07.340" style="s2">appear to be ubiquitous yes so we are</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.059" end="02:19:09.349" style="s2">now behind the 8-ball in our most</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.340" end="02:19:11.120" style="s2">remarkable well yes and no I mean to be</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.349" end="02:19:11.620" style="s2">blunt about it and to be horrible about</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.120" end="02:19:17.479" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.620" end="02:19:20.540" style="s2">we are strangely what is left of what we</p>
<p begin="02:19:17.479" end="02:19:22.490" style="s2">were and I know this because in some</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.540" end="02:19:26.000" style="s2">sense we were not founded as a nation of</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.490" end="02:19:27.979" style="s2">cowards yeah we were not founded as a</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.000" end="02:19:30.860" style="s2">nation of ruler rule-followers because</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.979" end="02:19:32.420" style="s2">lord knows King George gave a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.860" end="02:19:34.700" style="s2">rules and we didn&#39;t follow them yeah</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.420" end="02:19:38.630" style="s2">we&#39;re a bunch of savages and we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.700" end="02:19:42.229" style="s2">a bunch of anarchists and so the</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.630" end="02:19:46.760" style="s2">question is what is left of the US and</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.229" end="02:19:48.260" style="s2">what I horribly believe is that the tiny</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.760" end="02:19:52.790" style="s2">number of people that we sort of</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.260" end="02:19:55.550" style="s2">collected as our group are all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.790" end="02:19:57.860" style="s2">left of people who have the ability to</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.550" end="02:19:59.800" style="s2">speak up after processing things and</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.860" end="02:20:02.330" style="s2">finding our sense making architecture</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.800" end="02:20:05.689" style="s2">completely insane and you can actually</p>
<p begin="02:20:02.330" end="02:20:08.660" style="s2">begin to detect just how many there are</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.689" end="02:20:10.460" style="s2">because the circle begins to close right</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.660" end="02:20:13.220" style="s2">so that&#39;s true but the other thing is is</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.460" end="02:20:16.220" style="s2">that we you know and I know that every</p>
<p begin="02:20:13.220" end="02:20:18.770" style="s2">day I get letters and messages from</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.220" end="02:20:20.180" style="s2">people who say thank god you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.770" end="02:20:21.470" style="s2">speak I&#39;m almost at the point where I</p>
<p begin="02:20:20.180" end="02:20:23.660" style="s2">could say something but I know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.470" end="02:20:26.630" style="s2">gonna lose my job right and so the idea</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.660" end="02:20:28.221" style="s2">is I know exactly what is keeping oh s</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.630" end="02:20:31.131" style="s2">group of people from speak</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.221" end="02:20:32.931" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one they don&#39;t feel like they</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.131" end="02:20:34.580" style="s2">have any choice as in a presidential</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.931" end="02:20:36.801" style="s2">candidate they&#39;re just gonna pick always</p>
<p begin="02:20:34.580" end="02:20:39.110" style="s2">the the better of two terrible options</p>
<p begin="02:20:36.801" end="02:20:40.940" style="s2">yeah and the second thing is is that</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.110" end="02:20:45.521" style="s2">they can&#39;t afford to lose their jobs all</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.940" end="02:20:50.381" style="s2">right so so I have started talking about</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.521" end="02:20:54.650" style="s2">the first against the wall&#39; Club which</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.381" end="02:20:56.181" style="s2">in IDW style is named to be jarring and</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.650" end="02:20:57.921" style="s2">the point is look I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.181" end="02:21:01.790" style="s2">first against the wall but I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.921" end="02:21:04.940" style="s2">a couple things I&#39;m aware that one one</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.790" end="02:21:07.521" style="s2">is not going to find stable safe haven</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.940" end="02:21:10.341" style="s2">by placating them up there is no middle</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.521" end="02:21:12.171" style="s2">ground you can sign up for the mob and</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.341" end="02:21:13.580" style="s2">then we know what happens to you you</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.171" end="02:21:15.021" style="s2">will be eaten in the end it will take</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.580" end="02:21:17.030" style="s2">advantage of you and then at the point</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.021" end="02:21:18.561" style="s2">where there are spoils to be divided all</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.030" end="02:21:19.971" style="s2">hell&#39;s going to break loose for those</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.561" end="02:21:23.540" style="s2">who are part of the mob the so-called</p>
<p begin="02:21:19.971" end="02:21:26.450" style="s2">allies you can try to hedge right you</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.540" end="02:21:28.761" style="s2">can try to make some concessions let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.450" end="02:21:29.841" style="s2">try to stay look I don&#39;t know fan of</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.761" end="02:21:32.301" style="s2">Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.841" end="02:21:34.820" style="s2">however right I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.301" end="02:21:36.771" style="s2">everything that he says is wrong right</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.820" end="02:21:38.511" style="s2">you can do something like that in which</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.771" end="02:21:41.811" style="s2">case it&#39;ll come for you pretty soon yeah</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.511" end="02:21:44.660" style="s2">or you can say screw it there&#39;s no safe</p>
<p begin="02:21:41.811" end="02:21:46.881" style="s2">harbor to be had so I might as well say</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.660" end="02:21:49.370" style="s2">the truth right I might as well say the</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.881" end="02:21:50.990" style="s2">truth and what that means is they will</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.370" end="02:21:53.421" style="s2">put me against the wall first I know</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.990" end="02:21:56.301" style="s2">that right but I&#39;m not willing to</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.421" end="02:21:58.280" style="s2">compromise in order to be later against</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.301" end="02:21:59.900" style="s2">the wall first against the wall if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.280" end="02:22:03.551" style="s2">gonna be again I don&#39;t like this at all</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.900" end="02:22:07.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t I understand what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.551" end="02:22:09.801" style="s2">but my feeling about this is I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.610" end="02:22:11.960" style="s2">intending to be against me either right</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.801" end="02:22:13.671" style="s2">Oh either absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.960" end="02:22:17.301" style="s2">fuck the wall well we don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.671" end="02:22:19.040" style="s2">coming my point is don&#39;t hedge what why</p>
<p begin="02:22:17.301" end="02:22:25.391" style="s2">are you hedging what sir it gives you</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.040" end="02:22:25.391" style="s2">look let me make another argument</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.480" end="02:22:34.070" style="s2">imagine that the US Army was being held</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.580" end="02:22:36.330" style="s2">by 12 kids with a squirt gun yep</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.070" end="02:22:39.690" style="s2">at some point somebody&#39;s got to walk</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.330" end="02:22:41.790" style="s2">forward and take away a squirt gun from</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.690" end="02:22:42.870" style="s2">a child is gonna bawl like a baby like</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.790" end="02:22:44.880" style="s2">you remember what happened with the</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.870" end="02:22:47.340" style="s2">Kathy Newman Jordan Peterson thing where</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.880" end="02:22:48.750" style="s2">the idea is that they published this</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.340" end="02:22:50.670" style="s2">thing that was supposed to make Jordan</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.750" end="02:22:52.770" style="s2">look like an idiot and Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.670" end="02:22:54.060" style="s2">looked like a great interviewer in a</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.770" end="02:22:55.740" style="s2">totally backfire because they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:54.060" end="02:22:58.230" style="s2">understand what the what the read on it</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.740" end="02:23:00.090" style="s2">was gonna be yep then people got angry</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.230" end="02:23:01.650" style="s2">and then Kathy Newman said oh my god I</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.090" end="02:23:02.540" style="s2">can&#39;t believe it people are coming after</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.650" end="02:23:06.030" style="s2">me</p>

<p begin="02:23:06.030" end="02:23:08.370" style="s2">better than people that you sick on</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.620" end="02:23:13.260" style="s2">people every day</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.370" end="02:23:15.420" style="s2">yeah so I think what my claim is is that</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.260" end="02:23:18.540" style="s2">every time I conduct any kind of a poll</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.420" end="02:23:19.980" style="s2">I can say please retweet this broadly</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.540" end="02:23:22.260" style="s2">towards the people who are maximally</p>
<p begin="02:23:19.980" end="02:23:24.720" style="s2">likely to disagree with it the number of</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.260" end="02:23:28.610" style="s2">people supporting the supposed positions</p>
<p begin="02:23:24.720" end="02:23:30.960" style="s2">of the commentariat yeah is tiny</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.610" end="02:23:33.180" style="s2">nobody freakin likes this stuff</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.960" end="02:23:36.090" style="s2">everybody hates it now that&#39;s too strong</p>
<p begin="02:23:33.180" end="02:23:38.010" style="s2">no everybody is I mean look it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="02:23:38.010" end="02:23:42.600" style="s2">analysis problem and as I keep saying to</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.170" end="02:23:44.610" style="s2">people right the claims of this movement</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.600" end="02:23:47.250" style="s2">are really really stupid</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.610" end="02:23:50.100" style="s2">the strategy is incredibly smart and</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.250" end="02:23:52.350" style="s2">that distinction is important it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.100" end="02:23:54.240" style="s2">like somebody wrote down the strategy</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.350" end="02:23:56.160" style="s2">the strategy is more or less an evolved</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.240" end="02:23:58.100" style="s2">strategy it&#39;s a borrowed strategy but it</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.160" end="02:24:00.180" style="s2">is so sophisticated when it comes to</p>
<p begin="02:23:58.100" end="02:24:02.700" style="s2">co-opting people who should know better</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.180" end="02:24:04.650" style="s2">that really that&#39;s the thing you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:24:04.650" end="02:24:08.250" style="s2">preoptic so that&#39;s the kind of a word</p>
<p begin="02:24:06.900" end="02:24:11.660" style="s2">that you&#39;d use if you were privileged</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.250" end="02:24:11.660" style="s2">enough to go to college okay</p>

<p begin="02:24:15.170" end="02:24:22.380" style="s2">yeah so here&#39;s the question we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="02:24:20.370" end="02:24:25.260" style="s2">couple of puzzles that need to be solved</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.380" end="02:24:27.330" style="s2">I&#39;m just I&#39;m just trying to evidence how</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.260" end="02:24:29.880" style="s2">cheap it is to make an argument that</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.330" end="02:24:31.500" style="s2">then you&#39;re supposed to spend 10 to 15</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.880" end="02:24:33.090" style="s2">minutes falling over backwards and then</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.500" end="02:24:34.380" style="s2">I feel I&#39;m not privileged or that it</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.090" end="02:24:37.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter something yeah of course</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.380" end="02:24:38.370" style="s2">you know what here&#39;s my thing okay I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="02:25:16.380" end="02:25:20.370" style="s2">couple of problems one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.061" end="02:25:23.760" style="s2">that I think is not well understood is</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.370" end="02:25:25.890" style="s2">that there is something ultra dangerous</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.760" end="02:25:28.200" style="s2">about the leaderless nature of this</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.890" end="02:25:32.580" style="s2">movement there&#39;s a great place to start</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.200" end="02:25:35.010" style="s2">when I come back from a visit with the</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.580" end="02:25:37.830" style="s2">facilities hey folks welcome back we</p>
<p begin="02:25:35.010" end="02:25:40.021" style="s2">have taken a brief break we have checked</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.830" end="02:25:42.030" style="s2">in with events in the larger world and</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.021" end="02:25:43.860" style="s2">we have decided that at least the first</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.030" end="02:25:47.521" style="s2">step is very clear which is to start</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.860" end="02:25:49.800" style="s2">drinking it Cheers all right so we are</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.521" end="02:25:51.480" style="s2">facing a very interesting scenario in</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.800" end="02:25:53.820" style="s2">the outside world and it is changing so</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.480" end="02:25:56.311" style="s2">freaking fast that it is hard to even</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.820" end="02:25:58.890" style="s2">know what to think and of course this is</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.311" end="02:26:00.570" style="s2">very disorienting given how long we have</p>
<p begin="02:25:58.890" end="02:26:02.640" style="s2">been watching this thing unfold and how</p>
<p begin="02:26:00.570" end="02:26:04.590" style="s2">long it seemed somewhat limited to</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.640" end="02:26:08.150" style="s2">college campuses maybe it was a bang and</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.590" end="02:26:10.230" style="s2">then suddenly it&#39;s everywhere now</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.150" end="02:26:11.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be said about what it</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.230" end="02:26:13.380" style="s2">is and what it isn&#39;t really was never</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.640" end="02:26:15.420" style="s2">limited to college campuses I think that</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.380" end="02:26:17.610" style="s2">was the canard well it was limited to</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.420" end="02:26:19.650" style="s2">college campuses in the sense that a lot</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.610" end="02:26:21.120" style="s2">of what people could see was taking</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.650" end="02:26:24.601" style="s2">place there don&#39;t believe it well</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.120" end="02:26:25.890" style="s2">obviously I said to Congress this is not</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.601" end="02:26:27.360" style="s2">a phenomenon of college campuses and</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.890" end="02:26:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not a free speech yeah but it is</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.360" end="02:26:31.680" style="s2">just I don&#39;t want to waste time</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.820" end="02:26:33.300" style="s2">pretending that the majority is more</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.680" end="02:26:35.160" style="s2">right than they are they&#39;re crazy and</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.300" end="02:26:36.720" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong and it&#39;s clear they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.160" end="02:26:38.130" style="s2">crazy and they&#39;re wrong and the part</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.720" end="02:26:41.150" style="s2">that they had not clear they are not</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.130" end="02:26:45.120" style="s2">updating yeah is that this is actually a</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.150" end="02:26:47.220" style="s2">near-term threat to the Republic this is</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.120" end="02:26:49.080" style="s2">beyond the Republic dude I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.220" end="02:26:51.329" style="s2">even I know it&#39;s the West but at the</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.080" end="02:26:55.499" style="s2">very least dude</p>
<p begin="02:26:51.329" end="02:26:56.609" style="s2">we&#39;re in a nuclear I mean look part of</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.499" end="02:26:59.339" style="s2">the problems you have the wrong guests</p>
<p begin="02:26:56.609" end="02:27:01.619" style="s2">there are things that I cannot say I</p>
<p begin="02:26:59.339" end="02:27:04.859" style="s2">cannot say that this is about George</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.619" end="02:27:07.369" style="s2">Floyd because I&#39;m on record for years</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.859" end="02:27:09.359" style="s2">talking about the No Name revolution</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.369" end="02:27:12.089" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.359" end="02:27:13.739" style="s2">I can&#39;t claim that this is about college</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.089" end="02:27:20.969" style="s2">campuses because I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.739" end="02:27:24.319" style="s2">this generally I can&#39;t claim that any of</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.969" end="02:27:27.959" style="s2">this nonsense is true because I&#39;ve named</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.319" end="02:27:29.639" style="s2">this the twin nuclei problem if we find</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.959" end="02:27:32.699" style="s2">out that this comes from the Wuhan lab</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.639" end="02:27:34.679" style="s2">and then in fact it has to do with</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.699" end="02:27:36.599" style="s2">research whether intentionally</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.679" end="02:27:40.469" style="s2">weaponized or you know supposedly</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.599" end="02:27:42.359" style="s2">defensive or who knows what we have</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.469" end="02:27:46.979" style="s2">another nuclei left to go we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.359" end="02:27:49.229" style="s2">these games on a nuclear planet and I</p>
<p begin="02:27:46.979" end="02:27:52.949" style="s2">don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing I have no</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.229" end="02:27:54.689" style="s2">clue how people have the confidence that</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.949" end="02:27:56.909" style="s2">everything is going to be fine because</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.689" end="02:28:00.179" style="s2">it absolutely is not all going to be</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.909" end="02:28:01.770" style="s2">fine automatically if it&#39;s fine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.179" end="02:28:03.569" style="s2">because people are going to make it fine</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.770" end="02:28:04.679" style="s2">and people who are gonna make the people</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.569" end="02:28:06.359" style="s2">who are gonna make it fine are the</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.679" end="02:28:08.399" style="s2">people who are alarmed yeah the people</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.359" end="02:28:10.020" style="s2">who understand how unfine it is and what</p>
<p begin="02:28:08.399" end="02:28:12.089" style="s2">this trajectory does it right so I I</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.020" end="02:28:14.039" style="s2">feel like we have an affirmative action</p>

<p begin="02:29:23.510" end="02:29:27.530" style="s2">is we&#39;re up against a number of things</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.980" end="02:29:30.170" style="s2">one the number of actual fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:29:27.530" end="02:29:31.880" style="s2">thinkers is tiny well I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.170" end="02:29:35.601" style="s2">bigger than you&#39;re claiming the number</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.880" end="02:29:38.360" style="s2">of courageous ones I will say that Nance</p>
<p begin="02:29:35.601" end="02:29:40.550" style="s2">right yeah so number of fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.360" end="02:29:42.860" style="s2">thinkers is tiny the number of those</p>
<p begin="02:29:40.550" end="02:29:45.440" style="s2">people who are courageous enough to say</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.860" end="02:29:47.840" style="s2">anything is a tiny fraction of that and</p>
<p begin="02:29:45.440" end="02:29:50.271" style="s2">what that leaves us with is very few</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.840" end="02:29:53.181" style="s2">voices and we&#39;re all now in dialogue</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.271" end="02:29:54.860" style="s2">with each other which you know is good</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.181" end="02:29:57.110" style="s2">in one sense and I think dangerous in</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.860" end="02:30:00.050" style="s2">another in the sense that to whatever</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.110" end="02:30:02.931" style="s2">extent we have things wrong they we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.050" end="02:30:04.940" style="s2">disappointing and they&#39;re worse no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.931" end="02:30:06.561" style="s2">not kidding I&#39;m very disappointed with</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.940" end="02:30:07.910" style="s2">this a lot of the criticisms that they</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.561" end="02:30:10.101" style="s2">lodged was like okay you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.910" end="02:30:13.820" style="s2">component of truth to that and you yeah</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.101" end="02:30:16.641" style="s2">right exactly okay but but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.820" end="02:30:18.380" style="s2">other thing that you know it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.641" end="02:30:21.050" style="s2">I think for those of us who get what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.380" end="02:30:23.601" style="s2">going on to focus on those who are</p>
<p begin="02:30:21.050" end="02:30:25.340" style="s2">driving it and the obvious components</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.601" end="02:30:27.530" style="s2">here but I think there&#39;s some some</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.340" end="02:30:30.410" style="s2">things that are accidently interfacing</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.530" end="02:30:33.950" style="s2">with our moment that are very very</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.410" end="02:30:36.440" style="s2">destructive today more so the leader</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.950" end="02:30:38.510" style="s2">lessness leaderless ness is everywhere</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.440" end="02:30:40.311" style="s2">our would-be leaders aren&#39;t at all</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.510" end="02:30:42.320" style="s2">leader like they sort of you know the</p>
<p begin="02:30:40.311" end="02:30:44.601" style="s2">question is do they look presidential</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.320" end="02:30:46.010" style="s2">period right that&#39;s the question not are</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.601" end="02:30:47.690" style="s2">they Presidential I don&#39;t care if they</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.010" end="02:30:49.670" style="s2">look presidential if they know how to</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.690" end="02:30:53.811" style="s2">behave in the frickin office but none of</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.670" end="02:30:56.931" style="s2">them do so what we&#39;ve got is a scenario</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.811" end="02:30:59.120" style="s2">in which as I&#39;ve said elsewhere we have</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.931" end="02:31:00.590" style="s2">a very deep bench especially with</p>
<p begin="02:30:59.120" end="02:31:02.450" style="s2">respect to black intellectuals we have a</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.590" end="02:31:06.050" style="s2">very deep bench of people who are</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.450" end="02:31:08.870" style="s2">courageous capable of leading but they</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.050" end="02:31:10.641" style="s2">are all trapped in the gig economy you</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.870" end="02:31:12.620" style="s2">and I are trapped in the gig economy all</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.641" end="02:31:14.870" style="s2">the people who should be in positions of</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.620" end="02:31:17.570" style="s2">leadership which would be frankly</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.870" end="02:31:18.510" style="s2">crucial at this moment are trapped doing</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.570" end="02:31:20.819" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.510" end="02:31:23.490" style="s2">influencers and that influencer thing</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.819" end="02:31:25.200" style="s2">has some relationship to being elite art</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.490" end="02:31:27.000" style="s2">let me just ask you a question yeah you</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.200" end="02:31:30.779" style="s2">have a place where people can contribute</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.000" end="02:31:32.840" style="s2">to your and Heather&#39;s welfare yeah</p>
<p begin="02:31:30.779" end="02:31:37.680" style="s2">what&#39;s a call patreon patreon yeah okay</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.840" end="02:31:40.950" style="s2">is this thing on I hope so all right let</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.680" end="02:31:44.100" style="s2">me be honest the key issue that I see is</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.950" end="02:31:46.380" style="s2">getting people Fu money and one thing</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.100" end="02:31:48.720" style="s2">that you can do if you can&#39;t speak is to</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.380" end="02:31:50.910" style="s2">transfer your voice into Fu money to</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.720" end="02:31:52.260" style="s2">people who can or who are at least</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.910" end="02:31:55.859" style="s2">willing to go down with the ship</p>
<p begin="02:31:52.260" end="02:31:58.620" style="s2">so one possibility is to get Bret and</p>
<p begin="02:31:55.859" end="02:32:00.090" style="s2">Heather out of the gig economy and he</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.620" end="02:32:01.950" style="s2">can&#39;t say this and he didn&#39;t know that I</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.090" end="02:32:05.390" style="s2">was gonna say this because he also can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.950" end="02:32:10.830" style="s2">stop me so in part I already found them</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.390" end="02:32:14.930" style="s2">really can&#39;t you&#39;re by the way I looked</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.830" end="02:32:14.930" style="s2">up Marsha Marsha Marsha very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.960" end="02:32:19.500" style="s2">so one of the one of the issues is to</p>
<p begin="02:32:17.460" end="02:32:21.359" style="s2">get the people that you love doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:32:19.500" end="02:32:23.700" style="s2">have to be Bret and Heather out of the</p>
<p begin="02:32:21.359" end="02:32:25.710" style="s2">gig economy by transferring a small</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.700" end="02:32:27.569" style="s2">amount of your cash to people who are</p>
<p begin="02:32:25.710" end="02:32:31.649" style="s2">risking everything for your benefit so</p>
<p begin="02:32:27.569" end="02:32:33.840" style="s2">just FYI you can liberate people from</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.649" end="02:32:37.220" style="s2">the gig economy if you want to and in</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.840" end="02:32:41.520" style="s2">part the pocket of power of the purse</p>
<p begin="02:32:37.220" end="02:32:43.680" style="s2">reigned supreme thanks I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.520" end="02:32:45.420" style="s2">good message and there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.680" end="02:32:47.520" style="s2">people who are being courageous at this</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.420" end="02:32:49.410" style="s2">moment this kind of crisis reveals who</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.520" end="02:32:51.060" style="s2">they are and so pay close attention to</p>
<p begin="02:32:49.410" end="02:32:53.970" style="s2">that and then we&#39;ve got other who</p>

<p begin="02:34:04.380" end="02:34:13.739" style="s2">I can just say that hey 70% good on you</p>
<p begin="02:34:08.340" end="02:34:16.109" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m fond of this guy hotep Jesus</p>
<p begin="02:34:13.739" end="02:34:19.220" style="s2">there&#39;s some places where he&#39;s wrong but</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.109" end="02:34:21.210" style="s2">I think he&#39;s got the basic stuff okay</p>
<p begin="02:34:19.220" end="02:34:22.739" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s pretty good list all right</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.210" end="02:34:24.270" style="s2">so that&#39;s the black intellectual is how</p>
<p begin="02:34:22.739" end="02:34:27.479" style="s2">about non black you know like it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="02:34:24.270" end="02:34:29.550" style="s2">it&#39;s this is harder actually I know yeah</p>
<p begin="02:34:27.479" end="02:34:34.199" style="s2">well because weirdly the ability to</p>
<p begin="02:34:29.550" end="02:34:36.779" style="s2">speak is partially based upon what your</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.199" end="02:34:38.999" style="s2">intersectional points are yeah right and</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.779" end="02:34:41.640" style="s2">so in some sense you would expect that</p>
<p begin="02:34:38.999" end="02:34:43.020" style="s2">an underrated community which I would</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.640" end="02:34:45.479" style="s2">say black intellectuals have been an</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.020" end="02:34:48.779" style="s2">underrated community for not a short</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.479" end="02:34:50.819" style="s2">time yep you wouldn&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.779" end="02:34:54.420" style="s2">Thomas solo might be one of these folks</p>
<p begin="02:34:50.819" end="02:34:55.140" style="s2">yeah Thomas solo now of young people I</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.420" end="02:35:00.510" style="s2">would say</p>

<p begin="02:35:03.210" end="02:35:14.130" style="s2">impresses you particularly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:04.920" end="02:35:16.739" style="s2">younger younger well I really like Katy</p>
<p begin="02:35:14.130" end="02:35:22.859" style="s2">Hertzog and I know her enough to dress</p>

<p begin="02:35:22.859" end="02:35:25.890" style="s2">drawing a blank</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.899" end="02:35:29.029" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.890" end="02:35:29.029" style="s2">interesting question yeah</p>
<p begin="02:35:30.630" end="02:35:34.770" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna kick myself for the people I</p>
<p begin="02:35:33.029" end="02:35:40.050" style="s2">know I must be forgetting but but who</p>
<p begin="02:35:34.770" end="02:35:45.040" style="s2">the hell are they well you got a list I</p>
<p begin="02:35:40.050" end="02:35:48.580" style="s2">thought that Melissa Chen talking about</p>
<p begin="02:35:45.040" end="02:35:51.040" style="s2">Chinese issues on Joe Rogan as somebody</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.580" end="02:35:54.370" style="s2">of Chinese extraction it was very</p>
<p begin="02:35:51.040" end="02:35:56.080" style="s2">valuable yep because in part one of the</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.370" end="02:35:59.771" style="s2">questions that we have is who&#39;s allowed</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.080" end="02:36:03.130" style="s2">to say something based on their identity</p>
<p begin="02:35:59.771" end="02:36:05.440" style="s2">points about some issue right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.130" end="02:36:07.420" style="s2">alarmed about the People&#39;s Republic of</p>
<p begin="02:36:05.440" end="02:36:09.390" style="s2">China and the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.420" end="02:36:13.240" style="s2">having as much influence as as it does</p>
<p begin="02:36:09.390" end="02:36:15.700" style="s2">but I&#39;m alarmed as a an Ashkenazi Jewish</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.240" end="02:36:17.680" style="s2">person so gives you a lot less license</p>
<p begin="02:36:15.700" end="02:36:19.870" style="s2">to talk about it well no it gives me</p>
<p begin="02:36:17.680" end="02:36:21.600" style="s2">fine license to talk about it but in the</p>

<p begin="02:36:30.820" end="02:36:35.530" style="s2">don&#39;t call it out as mass insanity</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.280" end="02:36:38.021" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a problem yeah and I agree it</p>
<p begin="02:36:35.530" end="02:36:42.850" style="s2">is mass insanity and it has been labeled</p>
<p begin="02:36:38.021" end="02:36:45.010" style="s2">as literally a religious movement which</p>
<p begin="02:36:42.850" end="02:36:48.820" style="s2">it has many of those components it</p>

<p begin="02:37:15.040" end="02:37:18.910" style="s2">we have to talk about is the fact that</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.840" end="02:37:21.490" style="s2">this is within a universality class</p>
<p begin="02:37:18.910" end="02:37:25.660" style="s2">which we&#39;re data matters and lived</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.490" end="02:37:28.690" style="s2">experiences down sort of down regulated</p>
<p begin="02:37:25.660" end="02:37:31.180" style="s2">because it&#39;s too easy to say well you</p>
<p begin="02:37:28.690" end="02:37:33.340" style="s2">know my cousin Jim you know had a</p>
<p begin="02:37:31.180" end="02:37:37.360" style="s2">problem with the police and therefore</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.340" end="02:37:38.710" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah right oh it&#39;s anecdote at</p>
<p begin="02:37:37.360" end="02:37:40.420" style="s2">the same time we&#39;ve got an attack on</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.710" end="02:37:42.430" style="s2">stem to prevent us from correcting for</p>
<p begin="02:37:40.420" end="02:37:43.720" style="s2">the inning well that&#39;s true but and then</p>
<p begin="02:37:42.430" end="02:37:45.580" style="s2">we also have the problem that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.720" end="02:37:49.600" style="s2">certain issues that are invisible to us</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.580" end="02:37:52.210" style="s2">first so for example I was talking to</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.600" end="02:37:55.150" style="s2">this guy Mike Rasheed who is a</p>
<p begin="02:37:52.210" end="02:37:56.729" style="s2">bodybuilder and a heavyweight boxer who</p>
<p begin="02:37:55.150" end="02:37:59.340" style="s2">has done time in</p>
<p begin="02:37:56.729" end="02:38:01.020" style="s2">Arizona prison and his point to me was</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.340" end="02:38:03.539" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand that the situation</p>
<p begin="02:38:01.020" end="02:38:05.399" style="s2">with George Floyd is is that many of us</p>
<p begin="02:38:03.539" end="02:38:07.560" style="s2">feel that we&#39;re good people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:38:05.399" end="02:38:10.499" style="s2">pushed through desperation to bat it in</p>
<p begin="02:38:07.560" end="02:38:13.470" style="s2">violent actions oh I fully believe this</p>
<p begin="02:38:10.499" end="02:38:16.229" style="s2">I family the lived experience stuff my</p>
<p begin="02:38:13.470" end="02:38:18.449" style="s2">feeling about it is that we could learn</p>
<p begin="02:38:16.229" end="02:38:22.369" style="s2">from it if people stopped invoking it as</p>
<p begin="02:38:18.449" end="02:38:25.499" style="s2">a counter to statistics they are taking</p>
<p begin="02:38:22.369" end="02:38:28.199" style="s2">honest energy right there we have been</p>
<p begin="02:38:25.499" end="02:38:29.880" style="s2">staving off the French Revolution right</p>
<p begin="02:38:28.199" end="02:38:32.970" style="s2">right we&#39;ve been staving it off for a</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.880" end="02:38:35.579" style="s2">generation or more and in staving it off</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.970" end="02:38:37.800" style="s2">the pressure has built up and it is now</p>
<p begin="02:38:35.579" end="02:38:41.340" style="s2">spilled into the streets and it has been</p>
<p begin="02:38:37.800" end="02:38:43.590" style="s2">captured by people whose plans are not</p>
<p begin="02:38:41.340" end="02:38:45.029" style="s2">smart and not on earth well and this is</p>
<p begin="02:38:43.590" end="02:38:48.090" style="s2">this issue which is that we have a group</p>
<p begin="02:38:45.029" end="02:38:51.239" style="s2">of people who are deaf to the claim that</p>
<p begin="02:38:48.090" end="02:38:53.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a a problem with race and</p>
<p begin="02:38:51.239" end="02:38:55.350" style="s2">policing and criminal justice and</p>
<p begin="02:38:53.399" end="02:38:57.449" style="s2">prosecution and all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.350" end="02:38:58.680" style="s2">that&#39;s on one side and then then another</p>
<p begin="02:38:57.449" end="02:39:00.180" style="s2">group of people that don&#39;t want to look</p>
<p begin="02:38:58.680" end="02:39:01.949" style="s2">at any statistics because the lived</p>
<p begin="02:39:00.180" end="02:39:03.539" style="s2">experience Trump&#39;s everything yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:39:01.949" end="02:39:05.640" style="s2">the key point is both of these are</p>
<p begin="02:39:03.539" end="02:39:07.979" style="s2">problematic yep but the right thing to</p>
<p begin="02:39:05.640" end="02:39:10.020" style="s2">do is to use the lived experience as an</p>
<p begin="02:39:07.979" end="02:39:12.479" style="s2">intuition pump for what it is I should</p>
<p begin="02:39:10.020" end="02:39:15.090" style="s2">be asking as a question and then go</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.479" end="02:39:16.770" style="s2">gather statistics about that right to</p>
<p begin="02:39:15.090" end="02:39:21.180" style="s2">show that in fact the lived experience</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.770" end="02:39:24.479" style="s2">point it&#39;s a little bit like ethno</p>
<p begin="02:39:21.180" end="02:39:26.909" style="s2">pharmacology where okay so maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.479" end="02:39:30.300" style="s2">an Amazonian tribe that tells the story</p>
<p begin="02:39:26.909" end="02:39:32.489" style="s2">about you know the flower God coming and</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.300" end="02:39:34.859" style="s2">and and clearing us of our demons or</p>
<p begin="02:39:32.489" end="02:39:36.300" style="s2">something or whatever and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:39:34.859" end="02:39:38.369" style="s2">supposed to say actually I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="02:39:36.300" end="02:39:40.109" style="s2">to discount that I&#39;m gonna use that as</p>
<p begin="02:39:38.369" end="02:39:41.670" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go find the molecule that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:40.109" end="02:39:43.680" style="s2">responsible for the thing you just told</p>
<p begin="02:39:41.670" end="02:39:44.880" style="s2">me the myth about Amen why can&#39;t we yeah</p>
<p begin="02:39:43.680" end="02:39:48.119" style="s2">why can&#39;t we figure this out I know</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.880" end="02:39:50.149" style="s2">stupid because like obviously ethnic</p>
<p begin="02:39:48.119" end="02:39:53.369" style="s2">pharmacology we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:39:50.149" end="02:39:55.680" style="s2">genius-level people in the Amazon right</p>
<p begin="02:39:53.369" end="02:39:57.510" style="s2">but I don&#39;t want to pretend that I have</p>
<p begin="02:39:55.680" end="02:39:59.189" style="s2">to believe in the flower God in order to</p>
<p begin="02:39:57.510" end="02:40:03.869" style="s2">understand what they figured out right I</p>
<p begin="02:39:59.189" end="02:40:06.779" style="s2">mean frankly this is as close as taking</p>
<p begin="02:40:03.869" end="02:40:09.180" style="s2">ayahuasca because ayahuasca is an</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.779" end="02:40:10.471" style="s2">improbable combination of molecules that</p>
<p begin="02:40:09.180" end="02:40:12.150" style="s2">has an utterly</p>
<p begin="02:40:10.471" end="02:40:14.881" style="s2">unag normal effect you want to say</p>
<p begin="02:40:12.150" end="02:40:16.411" style="s2">things about the two components I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:40:14.881" end="02:40:18.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that I could say very much</p>
<p begin="02:40:16.411" end="02:40:20.671" style="s2">I mean I know a little but well you</p>
<p begin="02:40:18.690" end="02:40:21.780" style="s2">basically you have you have this DMT</p>
<p begin="02:40:20.671" end="02:40:26.070" style="s2">molecule which is a highly</p>
<p begin="02:40:21.780" end="02:40:27.451" style="s2">hallucinogenic you have an MAOI molecule</p>
<p begin="02:40:26.070" end="02:40:29.521" style="s2">it comes from a different plant and</p>
<p begin="02:40:27.451" end="02:40:31.801" style="s2">these people figured out that combine it</p>
<p begin="02:40:29.521" end="02:40:34.381" style="s2">these two plants combined together have</p>
<p begin="02:40:31.801" end="02:40:35.730" style="s2">it which how did they figure this out</p>
<p begin="02:40:34.381" end="02:40:37.921" style="s2">how do they figure it out and how do you</p>
<p begin="02:40:35.730" end="02:40:39.661" style="s2">know in a you know an environment where</p>
<p begin="02:40:37.921" end="02:40:41.101" style="s2">everything is so freaking toxic how</p>
<p begin="02:40:39.661" end="02:40:43.650" style="s2">exactly run the experiments together</p>
<p begin="02:40:41.101" end="02:40:46.021" style="s2">genius there&#39;s some genius whose name we</p>
<p begin="02:40:43.650" end="02:40:48.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah right or a composite</p>
<p begin="02:40:46.021" end="02:40:50.671" style="s2">genius over generations did whatever it</p>
<p begin="02:40:48.690" end="02:40:52.141" style="s2">had whatever it the point is there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:40:50.671" end="02:40:53.761" style="s2">a college it&#39;s not like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:40:52.141" end="02:40:57.150" style="s2">morons accidentally stumbled on</p>
<p begin="02:40:53.761" end="02:40:58.561" style="s2">ayahuasca right and then you get but the</p>
<p begin="02:40:57.150" end="02:41:00.570" style="s2">fact that they chose to tell a myth</p>
<p begin="02:40:58.561" end="02:41:02.581" style="s2">about how ayahuasca acts because they</p>
<p begin="02:41:00.570" end="02:41:04.621" style="s2">didn&#39;t have access to the pathway like</p>
<p begin="02:41:02.581" end="02:41:07.561" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna sit there prostrate right</p>
<p begin="02:41:04.621" end="02:41:09.721" style="s2">you know bowing down to the Amazonian</p>
<p begin="02:41:07.561" end="02:41:12.030" style="s2">genius my feeling is okay</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.721" end="02:41:13.681" style="s2">these geniuses ran this portion of the</p>
<p begin="02:41:12.030" end="02:41:15.871" style="s2">relay race now it&#39;s our turn to do our</p>
<p begin="02:41:13.681" end="02:41:17.431" style="s2">our genius stuff on top of yep and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:41:15.871" end="02:41:18.690" style="s2">got the perfect tools to do it and to</p>
<p begin="02:41:17.431" end="02:41:20.490" style="s2">shut down those tools at this moment</p>
<p begin="02:41:18.690" end="02:41:22.291" style="s2">amen and the idea that I can&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.490" end="02:41:24.841" style="s2">conversation or anywhere it drives me</p>
<p begin="02:41:22.291" end="02:41:27.001" style="s2">nuts yeah well yes so we have a very</p>
<p begin="02:41:24.841" end="02:41:29.490" style="s2">small crowd of people who are ready for</p>
<p begin="02:41:27.001" end="02:41:32.221" style="s2">this so if we don&#39;t have very many on</p>
<p begin="02:41:29.490" end="02:41:35.311" style="s2">the list of young we have huge numbers</p>
<p begin="02:41:32.221" end="02:41:38.030" style="s2">of people who are who have somebody</p>
<p begin="02:41:35.311" end="02:41:41.610" style="s2">else&#39;s hands around their throat yes</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.030" end="02:41:43.591" style="s2">they do and because we&#39;ve sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:41:41.610" end="02:41:47.131" style="s2">those hands are China sometimes those</p>
<p begin="02:41:43.591" end="02:41:49.921" style="s2">hands are the commentariat sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:41:47.131" end="02:41:52.440" style="s2">those hands are people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.921" end="02:41:54.211" style="s2">keep an illusion going because they you</p>
<p begin="02:41:52.440" end="02:41:57.091" style="s2">know like a every University is a fraud</p>
<p begin="02:41:54.211" end="02:41:59.371" style="s2">all right I want to try to rescue my</p>
<p begin="02:41:57.091" end="02:42:01.471" style="s2">idea of the first against the wall club</p>
<p begin="02:41:59.371" end="02:42:03.480" style="s2">because I think this is important so I</p>
<p begin="02:42:01.471" end="02:42:06.811" style="s2">am starting the first against the wall</p>
<p begin="02:42:03.480" end="02:42:08.551" style="s2">club and the point of this is not that I</p>
<p begin="02:42:06.811" end="02:42:11.371" style="s2">want to be first against the wall I</p>
<p begin="02:42:08.551" end="02:42:13.471" style="s2">better not be I want to avoid being</p>
<p begin="02:42:11.371" end="02:42:17.101" style="s2">against the wall but because there is no</p>
<p begin="02:42:13.471" end="02:42:19.021" style="s2">safe harbor if you become an ally of</p>

<p begin="02:42:19.021" end="02:42:22.440" style="s2">no longer useful to it and then they</p>
<p begin="02:42:20.311" end="02:42:24.391" style="s2">will go after you if you try to placate</p>
<p begin="02:42:22.440" end="02:42:26.400" style="s2">it by saying</p>
<p begin="02:42:24.391" end="02:42:29.400" style="s2">half-truths then it will come after you</p>
<p begin="02:42:26.400" end="02:42:32.341" style="s2">pretty soon the only thing the only</p>
<p begin="02:42:29.400" end="02:42:33.750" style="s2">valuable position that I see is speaking</p>
<p begin="02:42:32.341" end="02:42:35.551" style="s2">the truth and accepting the consequences</p>
<p begin="02:42:33.750" end="02:42:38.311" style="s2">and the reason that I think this is</p>
<p begin="02:42:35.551" end="02:42:41.700" style="s2">important is that I know from experience</p>
<p begin="02:42:38.311" end="02:42:45.030" style="s2">that people have to stare into the abyss</p>
<p begin="02:42:41.700" end="02:42:48.030" style="s2">in order to find their courage and so</p>
<p begin="02:42:45.030" end="02:42:50.610" style="s2">there&#39;s some process I think it takes</p>
<p begin="02:42:48.030" end="02:42:52.830" style="s2">for people who have it in them maybe a</p>
<p begin="02:42:50.610" end="02:42:54.690" style="s2">couple of weeks a couple of weeks of</p>
<p begin="02:42:52.830" end="02:42:56.820" style="s2">thinking holy crap is that really am I</p>
<p begin="02:42:54.690" end="02:43:00.181" style="s2">do I accept that is there something else</p>
<p begin="02:42:56.820" end="02:43:03.420" style="s2">to do and then you get used to it</p>
<p begin="02:43:00.181" end="02:43:05.400" style="s2">you come to understand that okay that is</p>
<p begin="02:43:03.420" end="02:43:08.580" style="s2">not the fate I want but I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="02:43:05.400" end="02:43:11.400" style="s2">accept the possibility of that fate in</p>
<p begin="02:43:08.580" end="02:43:12.900" style="s2">order not to suffer this other fate and</p>
<p begin="02:43:11.400" end="02:43:15.391" style="s2">one of the fates that you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:43:12.900" end="02:43:21.630" style="s2">suffer is losing your ability to speak</p>

<p begin="02:43:37.771" end="02:43:40.980" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s genius maybe the idea is I</p>
<p begin="02:43:39.630" end="02:43:43.740" style="s2">don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s genius</p>

<p begin="02:44:30.660" end="02:44:35.601" style="s2">submitted a wrong answer on their</p>
<p begin="02:44:33.091" end="02:44:39.690" style="s2">mathematics that they&#39;re wrong</p>

<p begin="02:46:28.351" end="02:46:32.610" style="s2">maybe the male idiom but at the point is</p>
<p begin="02:46:30.570" end="02:46:34.891" style="s2">actual equality involves taking that</p>
<p begin="02:46:32.610" end="02:46:36.990" style="s2">part of the male idiom and acquiring we</p>
<p begin="02:46:34.891" end="02:46:38.610" style="s2">even good at it that&#39;s some level you</p>

<p begin="02:46:47.279" end="02:46:51.930" style="s2">win one of these points I take a fucking</p>
<p begin="02:46:50.100" end="02:46:59.209" style="s2">victory left because it&#39;s hard to beat</p>
<p begin="02:46:51.930" end="02:47:02.609" style="s2">him oh yeah alright so the point was</p>
<p begin="02:46:59.209" end="02:47:06.720" style="s2">leadership hmm because of its absence is</p>
<p begin="02:47:02.609" end="02:47:09.209" style="s2">creating a lethal hazard were the energy</p>
<p begin="02:47:06.720" end="02:47:10.589" style="s2">yeah the French Revolution energy that</p>
<p begin="02:47:09.209" end="02:47:14.489" style="s2">has spilled into our streets to have</p>
<p begin="02:47:10.589" end="02:47:18.209" style="s2">proper leaders smart cogent people right</p>
<p begin="02:47:14.489" end="02:47:20.249" style="s2">right they could shut down the value are</p>
<p begin="02:47:18.209" end="02:47:21.810" style="s2">their leaders no you sure</p>
<p begin="02:47:20.249" end="02:47:23.430" style="s2">well I&#39;m not saying that there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="02:47:21.810" end="02:47:25.199" style="s2">in that role but I&#39;m saying when I look</p>
<p begin="02:47:23.430" end="02:47:27.499" style="s2">at them I&#39;m saying that they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="02:47:25.199" end="02:47:31.470" style="s2">to be leaders right now tiller Mike yeah</p>
<p begin="02:47:27.499" end="02:47:37.310" style="s2">made a very clear bid for being the</p>
<p begin="02:47:31.470" end="02:47:40.649" style="s2">leader in Atlanta you did Dave Chappelle</p>
<p begin="02:47:37.310" end="02:47:41.189" style="s2">made a bid by saying I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="02:47:40.649" end="02:47:44.549" style="s2">the leader</p>
<p begin="02:47:41.189" end="02:47:47.069" style="s2">I trust the street that guy is not</p>
<p begin="02:47:44.549" end="02:47:50.189" style="s2">stupid well that was a bid for later</p>
<p begin="02:47:47.069" end="02:47:53.129" style="s2">leadership that was Gary B I actually</p>
<p begin="02:47:50.189" end="02:47:56.010" style="s2">think that in Dave Chappelle&#39;s case he</p>
<p begin="02:47:53.129" end="02:47:58.770" style="s2">is suffering from the same thing that</p>
<p begin="02:47:56.010" end="02:48:02.159" style="s2">those of us who are more tuned in at a</p>
<p begin="02:47:58.770" end="02:48:05.520" style="s2">daily level are suffering which is the</p>
<p begin="02:48:02.159" end="02:48:09.060" style="s2">Edit on our raw data yeah he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:48:05.520" end="02:48:11.220" style="s2">bad I don&#39;t think that that was the</p>
<p begin="02:48:09.060" end="02:48:11.789" style="s2">final word of Dave Chappelle oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:48:11.220" end="02:48:13.350" style="s2">think so either</p>
<p begin="02:48:11.789" end="02:48:16.260" style="s2">I think the Dave Chappelle bought</p>
<p begin="02:48:13.350" end="02:48:19.770" style="s2">himself a huge ton of credibility with</p>
<p begin="02:48:16.260" end="02:48:21.749" style="s2">the street well I hope so because if</p>
<p begin="02:48:19.770" end="02:48:24.029" style="s2">Dave Chappelle emerges as leader I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:48:21.749" end="02:48:26.189" style="s2">suddenly am in a position to breathe a</p>
<p begin="02:48:24.029" end="02:48:30.810" style="s2">great sigh of relief if I had to</p>
<p begin="02:48:26.189" end="02:48:32.069" style="s2">conjecture yeah I&#39;m not am i right that</p>
<p begin="02:48:30.810" end="02:48:34.319" style="s2">you and I both have a very high</p>
<p begin="02:48:32.069" end="02:48:37.770" style="s2">estimation of Dave Chappelle from</p>
<p begin="02:48:34.319" end="02:48:40.949" style="s2">intellectually from the minute my belief</p>
<p begin="02:48:37.770" end="02:48:45.449" style="s2">is that comedy is a weird game it is</p>
<p begin="02:48:40.949" end="02:48:47.520" style="s2">weirdly meritocratic they laugh or they</p>
<p begin="02:48:45.449" end="02:48:48.959" style="s2">don&#39;t laugh well I would say differently</p>
<p begin="02:48:47.520" end="02:48:52.229" style="s2">the comedians have a different</p>
<p begin="02:48:48.959" end="02:48:54.810" style="s2">understanding of the ranking the</p>
<p begin="02:48:52.229" end="02:48:56.699" style="s2">comedian&#39;s have a well-crafted joke</p>
<p begin="02:48:54.810" end="02:48:57.060" style="s2">rubric that is everybody understands</p>
<p begin="02:48:56.699" end="02:48:59.010" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="02:48:57.060" end="02:49:00.399" style="s2">Gallagher used to be able to get laughs</p>
<p begin="02:48:59.010" end="02:49:02.260" style="s2">but in general he</p>
<p begin="02:49:00.399" end="02:49:03.729" style="s2">wasn&#39;t seen as being the top of the</p>
<p begin="02:49:02.260" end="02:49:09.039" style="s2">comedic pile because he was a prop comic</p>
<p begin="02:49:03.729" end="02:49:13.209" style="s2">except I&#39;m not positive the Dave</p>
<p begin="02:49:09.039" end="02:49:15.520" style="s2">Chappelle was using this appearance to</p>
<p begin="02:49:13.209" end="02:49:18.909" style="s2">establish his credibility and that his</p>
<p begin="02:49:15.520" end="02:49:20.709" style="s2">later act will actually be the one</p>
<p begin="02:49:18.909" end="02:49:22.959" style="s2">that&#39;s important so I&#39;m gonna just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:49:20.709" end="02:49:24.999" style="s2">gonna plant that flag perfect okay I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:49:22.959" end="02:49:28.209" style="s2">love that to be true because this was</p>
<p begin="02:49:24.999" end="02:49:31.479" style="s2">disappointing if that&#39;s all there is yes</p>
<p begin="02:49:28.209" end="02:49:34.869" style="s2">and it was conspicuous right so in some</p>
<p begin="02:49:31.479" end="02:49:37.449" style="s2">sense it does leave the question about</p>
<p begin="02:49:34.869" end="02:49:39.699" style="s2">what comes later you know the the length</p>

<p begin="02:49:39.699" end="02:49:43.180" style="s2">sorts of things about interesting he</p>
<p begin="02:49:40.959" end="02:49:45.880" style="s2">personalized it so he said I was born at</p>
<p begin="02:49:43.180" end="02:49:48.159" style="s2">8:46 in the morning and it was a minute</p>
<p begin="02:49:45.880" end="02:49:52.090" style="s2">46 seconds on this guy&#39;s neck yeah</p>
<p begin="02:49:48.159" end="02:49:54.039" style="s2">George Floyd&#39;s neck and he also did some</p>
<p begin="02:49:52.090" end="02:49:55.899" style="s2">other stuff with his birthday and he</p>
<p begin="02:49:54.039" end="02:49:58.180" style="s2">talked about this in terms of his father</p>
<p begin="02:49:55.899" end="02:50:00.819" style="s2">calling for his mother on his deathbed</p>
<p begin="02:49:58.180" end="02:50:02.229" style="s2">and the mother being close to slavery</p>
<p begin="02:50:00.819" end="02:50:06.479" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that far in our rearview</p>
<p begin="02:50:02.229" end="02:50:11.680" style="s2">mirror it was a masterful construction</p>
<p begin="02:50:06.479" end="02:50:13.239" style="s2">which did not like you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:50:11.680" end="02:50:16.270" style="s2">weird thing about Strauss II and</p>
<p begin="02:50:13.239" end="02:50:17.949" style="s2">communication when you see a person who</p>
<p begin="02:50:16.270" end="02:50:19.869" style="s2">you respect as much as I think both of</p>
<p begin="02:50:17.949" end="02:50:25.739" style="s2">us respect Dave Chappelle intellectually</p>
<p begin="02:50:19.869" end="02:50:28.419" style="s2">not using all neurons available I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:50:25.739" end="02:50:31.060" style="s2">loathe to think that he&#39;s thinking this</p>
<p begin="02:50:28.419" end="02:50:32.739" style="s2">through less than we are and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:50:31.060" end="02:50:34.600" style="s2">inclined to think that he&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="02:50:32.739" end="02:50:36.909" style="s2">this thing through more than me well I</p>
<p begin="02:50:34.600" end="02:50:39.909" style="s2">don&#39;t disagree with that and so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:50:36.909" end="02:50:41.919" style="s2">you&#39;ll respect that my hypothesis about</p>
<p begin="02:50:39.909" end="02:50:45.340" style="s2">what&#39;s going on is that he encountered</p>
<p begin="02:50:41.919" end="02:50:47.350" style="s2">data that did not allow him to look well</p>
<p begin="02:50:45.340" end="02:50:49.119" style="s2">would be one possibly this is that he</p>
<p begin="02:50:47.350" end="02:50:53.319" style="s2">was using very high-level heuristics</p>
<p begin="02:50:49.119" end="02:50:56.800" style="s2">right on the data he got but I think</p>
<p begin="02:50:53.319" end="02:50:59.260" style="s2">that in part you see despite the fact</p>
<p begin="02:50:56.800" end="02:51:01.539" style="s2">that I think that we redirected all of</p>
<p begin="02:50:59.260" end="02:51:03.760" style="s2">the kovat energy towards George Floyd</p>
<p begin="02:51:01.539" end="02:51:05.499" style="s2">and policing and all of the economic</p>
<p begin="02:51:03.760" end="02:51:09.279" style="s2">energy with the sky high unemployment</p>
<p begin="02:51:05.499" end="02:51:10.180" style="s2">towards George Floyd policing I think</p>
<p begin="02:51:09.279" end="02:51:12.459" style="s2">that there was another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:51:10.180" end="02:51:14.079" style="s2">being said to us which is not being said</p>
<p begin="02:51:12.459" end="02:51:17.720" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="02:51:14.079" end="02:51:22.459" style="s2">which is we&#39;ve been waiting for a long</p>
<p begin="02:51:17.720" end="02:51:24.890" style="s2">time to get rid of the specter that is</p>
<p begin="02:51:22.459" end="02:51:30.470" style="s2">the invisible racism that we feel but</p>
<p begin="02:51:24.890" end="02:51:34.159" style="s2">cannot pinpoint oh yeah and I saw him in</p>
<p begin="02:51:30.470" end="02:51:36.680" style="s2">part glom on to that oh yeah I agree and</p>
<p begin="02:51:34.159" end="02:51:38.329" style="s2">so this is very frustrating she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:51:36.680" end="02:51:40.189" style="s2">maybe maybe we the black community are</p>
<p begin="02:51:38.329" end="02:51:42.289" style="s2">gonna hijack some energy that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:51:40.189" end="02:51:45.050" style="s2">ours but on the other hand you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:51:42.289" end="02:51:47.600" style="s2">hijacked shit for so long oh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:51:45.050" end="02:51:49.369" style="s2">lot of this that actually the</p>
<p begin="02:51:47.600" end="02:51:51.079" style="s2">frightening thing is if you take shit</p>
<p begin="02:51:49.369" end="02:51:53.300" style="s2">that the black community has put up with</p>
<p begin="02:51:51.079" end="02:51:56.209" style="s2">has simply put up with because it had no</p>
<p begin="02:51:53.300" end="02:51:58.689" style="s2">choice right and you turn it around it</p>
<p begin="02:51:56.209" end="02:52:02.359" style="s2">looks a lot like this but the problem is</p>
<p begin="02:51:58.689" end="02:52:04.189" style="s2">the this issue of oppression reversing</p>
<p begin="02:52:02.359" end="02:52:05.479" style="s2">right instead of ending oppression</p>
<p begin="02:52:04.189" end="02:52:08.390" style="s2">turning the tables in the press right</p>
<p begin="02:52:05.479" end="02:52:11.539" style="s2">but the problem is the republic will not</p>
<p begin="02:52:08.390" end="02:52:13.999" style="s2">survive that reversal in other words the</p>
<p begin="02:52:11.539" end="02:52:14.869" style="s2">republic could tolerate the unfairness</p>
<p begin="02:52:13.999" end="02:52:16.579" style="s2">to black people</p>
<p begin="02:52:14.869" end="02:52:19.010" style="s2">it was completely unjust and</p>
<p begin="02:52:16.579" end="02:52:21.739" style="s2">unacceptable and on american but it was</p>
<p begin="02:52:19.010" end="02:52:23.090" style="s2">not fatal turning the tables of this</p>
<p begin="02:52:21.739" end="02:52:25.459" style="s2">oppression well we&#39;ll be quickly</p>
<p begin="02:52:23.090" end="02:52:26.989" style="s2">finished yeah you don&#39;t even mean what</p>
<p begin="02:52:25.459" end="02:52:27.999" style="s2">you just said because i know you very</p>
<p begin="02:52:26.989" end="02:52:33.919" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="02:52:27.999" end="02:52:36.470" style="s2">it was fatal at the level of it betrayed</p>
<p begin="02:52:33.919" end="02:52:39.379" style="s2">the ideals of the republic no even if</p>
<p begin="02:52:36.470" end="02:52:41.600" style="s2">the republic was viable it was viable as</p>
<p begin="02:52:39.379" end="02:52:44.749" style="s2">a non serious entity in a weird way</p>
<p begin="02:52:41.600" end="02:52:48.560" style="s2">right which is why right i am so upset</p>
<p begin="02:52:44.749" end="02:52:51.560" style="s2">at the slogan mega yeah because the</p>
<p begin="02:52:48.560" end="02:52:53.959" style="s2">point is that last a if again yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:52:51.560" end="02:52:56.539" style="s2">the again if you are in one of the</p>
<p begin="02:52:53.959" end="02:52:59.029" style="s2">populations for which America was never</p>
<p begin="02:52:56.539" end="02:53:01.039" style="s2">great this is a finger in the eye right</p>
<p begin="02:52:59.029" end="02:53:03.020" style="s2">right and so my feeling is look I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:53:01.039" end="02:53:04.459" style="s2">signing on to that goddamn slogan even</p>
<p begin="02:53:03.020" end="02:53:06.289" style="s2">though I would love for America to be</p>
<p begin="02:53:04.459" end="02:53:09.020" style="s2">great and I am proud of what America is</p>
<p begin="02:53:06.289" end="02:53:11.479" style="s2">in many regards I cannot sign on to that</p>
<p begin="02:53:09.020" end="02:53:12.919" style="s2">fucking second a unless you take care of</p>
<p begin="02:53:11.479" end="02:53:14.899" style="s2">everybody are they not Americans well</p>
<p begin="02:53:12.919" end="02:53:16.489" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a more devious slogan than</p>
<p begin="02:53:14.899" end="02:53:17.749" style="s2">that I mean I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="02:53:16.489" end="02:53:20.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve been on this since the beginning</p>
<p begin="02:53:17.749" end="02:53:22.039" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s a good call I guess the</p>
<p begin="02:53:20.359" end="02:53:25.939" style="s2">idea is that there are ways in which</p>
<p begin="02:53:22.039" end="02:53:26.810" style="s2">America was once great that it needs to</p>
<p begin="02:53:25.939" end="02:53:27.260" style="s2">be great again</p>
<p begin="02:53:26.810" end="02:53:29.359" style="s2">yeah and there</p>
<p begin="02:53:27.260" end="02:53:31.279" style="s2">ways in which America has never been</p>
<p begin="02:53:29.359" end="02:53:33.560" style="s2">great in which case it needs to become</p>
<p begin="02:53:31.279" end="02:53:36.140" style="s2">great for the first time and new yeah</p>
<p begin="02:53:33.560" end="02:53:38.450" style="s2">and so the issue is there is America to</p>
<p begin="02:53:36.140" end="02:53:40.310" style="s2">be made great again yeah and there is</p>
<p begin="02:53:38.450" end="02:53:41.720" style="s2">America that has never been great and</p>
<p begin="02:53:40.310" end="02:53:44.600" style="s2">needs to be made great for the first</p>
<p begin="02:53:41.720" end="02:53:48.069" style="s2">time and that make America great again</p>
<p begin="02:53:44.600" end="02:53:51.229" style="s2">is one of these perfectly ambiguous</p>
<p begin="02:53:48.069" end="02:53:53.420" style="s2">slogans designed to be work designed to</p>
<p begin="02:53:51.229" end="02:53:55.130" style="s2">be a Rorschach test yeah exactly right</p>
<p begin="02:53:53.420" end="02:53:58.939" style="s2">it&#39;s designed app and so you know my</p>
<p begin="02:53:55.130" end="02:54:00.890" style="s2">feeling about this is it&#39;s it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="02:53:58.939" end="02:54:01.850" style="s2">than you&#39;re saying because it&#39;s cleverer</p>
<p begin="02:54:00.890" end="02:54:06.290" style="s2">than you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="02:54:01.850" end="02:54:08.240" style="s2">no I agree with that actually but and by</p>
<p begin="02:54:06.290" end="02:54:11.029" style="s2">the way people don&#39;t know this and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:54:08.240" end="02:54:13.640" style="s2">never really gotten this out but when I</p>
<p begin="02:54:11.029" end="02:54:18.229" style="s2">went to meet with Kanye which was put</p>
<p begin="02:54:13.640" end="02:54:20.990" style="s2">into Barry Weiss&#39;s calm article times</p>
<p begin="02:54:18.229" end="02:54:24.050" style="s2">peace yeah right I was not happy about</p>
<p begin="02:54:20.990" end="02:54:25.850" style="s2">her talking about that nor was I happy</p>
<p begin="02:54:24.050" end="02:54:29.020" style="s2">talking about the Candice Owens and</p>
<p begin="02:54:25.850" end="02:54:35.120" style="s2">Candice Owens was my entree on to Kanye</p>
<p begin="02:54:29.020" end="02:54:38.029" style="s2">my entire focus was what were we going</p>
<p begin="02:54:35.120" end="02:54:43.790" style="s2">to do with mega the slogan when Trump</p>
<p begin="02:54:38.029" end="02:54:46.460" style="s2">was gone right and then in essence we</p>
<p begin="02:54:43.790" end="02:54:50.630" style="s2">were you know as Scott Adams I think</p>
<p begin="02:54:46.460" end="02:54:54.979" style="s2">maybe popularized like one screen</p>
<p begin="02:54:50.630" end="02:54:56.899" style="s2">multiple movies or two movies who was it</p>
<p begin="02:54:54.979" end="02:55:01.029" style="s2">who is going to give us a common picture</p>
<p begin="02:54:56.899" end="02:55:03.439" style="s2">of Magha and the hope was the Kanye</p>
<p begin="02:55:01.029" end="02:55:05.750" style="s2">who&#39;s a different kind of genius an</p>
<p begin="02:55:03.439" end="02:55:10.069" style="s2">artistic genius but not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="02:55:05.750" end="02:55:11.990" style="s2">political one yeah was the person who</p>
<p begin="02:55:10.069" end="02:55:14.990" style="s2">would have had the highest likelihood of</p>
<p begin="02:55:11.990" end="02:55:16.550" style="s2">getting us onto the same page when the</p>
<p begin="02:55:14.990" end="02:55:18.770" style="s2">idea is that somebody had come up with a</p>
<p begin="02:55:16.550" end="02:55:20.689" style="s2">slogan which functioned as the dress if</p>
<p begin="02:55:18.770" end="02:55:24.170" style="s2">you recall is it black and blue or white</p>
<p begin="02:55:20.689" end="02:55:28.010" style="s2">and gold and that was the hope that the</p>
<p begin="02:55:24.170" end="02:55:31.569" style="s2">hope was that Kanye was the only guy in</p>
<p begin="02:55:28.010" end="02:55:36.729" style="s2">the country who could actually speak and</p>
<p begin="02:55:31.569" end="02:55:39.890" style="s2">do the Obama 360 trick so Obama in his</p>
<p begin="02:55:36.729" end="02:55:40.851" style="s2">affirmative action speech walked around</p>
<p begin="02:55:39.890" end="02:55:42.681" style="s2">affirmative action</p>
<p begin="02:55:40.851" end="02:55:47.900" style="s2">and let everyone know that he could see</p>
<p begin="02:55:42.681" end="02:55:49.881" style="s2">their viewpoint uh-huh well I see it I</p>
<p begin="02:55:47.900" end="02:55:51.351" style="s2">mean I Kayne didn&#39;t have that skill in</p>
<p begin="02:55:49.881" end="02:55:53.631" style="s2">my opinion not because he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:55:51.351" end="02:55:56.331" style="s2">artistically gifted but because it</p>
<p begin="02:55:53.631" end="02:55:57.921" style="s2">required a different skill set well yeah</p>
<p begin="02:55:56.331" end="02:56:00.711" style="s2">we know it didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="02:55:57.921" end="02:56:02.421" style="s2">I think his embrace of Candace was a</p>
<p begin="02:56:00.711" end="02:56:05.990" style="s2">particular problem because Candace is a</p>
<p begin="02:56:02.421" end="02:56:08.181" style="s2">special entity well this is different</p>
<p begin="02:56:05.990" end="02:56:11.030" style="s2">her purposes not black facing its white</p>
<p begin="02:56:08.181" end="02:56:13.820" style="s2">face well can Candace is a very</p>
<p begin="02:56:11.030" end="02:56:16.070" style="s2">complicated or was a very complicated</p>
<p begin="02:56:13.820" end="02:56:17.480" style="s2">object that chose to simplify in a</p>
<p begin="02:56:16.070" end="02:56:19.971" style="s2">particular direction which was</p>
<p begin="02:56:17.480" end="02:56:22.700" style="s2">unfortunate you saw what she did where</p>
<p begin="02:56:19.971" end="02:56:24.141" style="s2">she pulled back with Sam Harris when she</p>
<p begin="02:56:22.700" end="02:56:27.110" style="s2">and sam Harris were on different sides</p>
<p begin="02:56:24.141" end="02:56:28.851" style="s2">of an issue so I got a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="02:56:27.110" end="02:56:30.381" style="s2">of guff for pointing to Candace as</p>

<p begin="02:56:37.940" end="02:56:41.870" style="s2">this problem that somebody actually</p>
<p begin="02:56:39.230" end="02:56:44.181" style="s2">builds bridges in private and burns them</p>
<p begin="02:56:41.870" end="02:56:46.131" style="s2">in public because red meat pays the</p>
<p begin="02:56:44.181" end="02:56:48.230" style="s2">bills yeah but they&#39;re actually playing</p>

<p begin="02:56:48.230" end="02:56:55.490" style="s2">another example of this is somebody who</p>
<p begin="02:56:51.881" end="02:56:58.400" style="s2">quite honestly is often looking to</p>
<p begin="02:56:55.490" end="02:57:00.110" style="s2">repair things in private but it has a</p>
<p begin="02:56:58.400" end="02:57:01.610" style="s2">business to attend to which is pointing</p>
<p begin="02:57:00.110" end="02:57:03.860" style="s2">out what the problems are with the other</p>
<p begin="02:57:01.610" end="02:57:05.631" style="s2">side yeah the thing about Candace though</p>
<p begin="02:57:03.860" end="02:57:07.671" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s possible I&#39;m just wrong</p>
<p begin="02:57:05.631" end="02:57:10.070" style="s2">about her yeah but I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:57:07.671" end="02:57:12.141" style="s2">been I&#39;ve been in the same place with</p>
<p begin="02:57:10.070" end="02:57:14.030" style="s2">Candace from the beginning of her rise</p>
<p begin="02:57:12.141" end="02:57:15.891" style="s2">agreed right I mean I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:57:14.030" end="02:57:18.021" style="s2">changed positions and you&#39;ve seen what</p>
<p begin="02:57:15.891" end="02:57:20.120" style="s2">was positive and what she was doing and</p>
<p begin="02:57:18.021" end="02:57:22.671" style="s2">your point was is that she will do to</p>
<p begin="02:57:20.120" end="02:57:24.591" style="s2">the positive which should not be done to</p>
<p begin="02:57:22.671" end="02:57:26.570" style="s2">the positive because she will mangle</p>
<p begin="02:57:24.591" end="02:57:28.551" style="s2">whatever it is that she can see that</p>
<p begin="02:57:26.570" end="02:57:29.751" style="s2">could be positive with the negative of</p>
<p begin="02:57:28.551" end="02:57:31.490" style="s2">the red meat and I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:57:29.751" end="02:57:34.521" style="s2">been wrong about yeah so far I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:57:31.490" end="02:57:36.620" style="s2">seen a break in the story it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:57:34.521" end="02:57:39.320" style="s2">divided by the same function but anyway</p>
<p begin="02:57:36.620" end="02:57:41.450" style="s2">you know interesting that Dave Chappelle</p>
<p begin="02:57:39.320" end="02:57:43.581" style="s2">called her out in his day I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:57:41.450" end="02:57:46.160" style="s2">thrilled in how he did it but but</p>
<p begin="02:57:43.581" end="02:57:46.820" style="s2">nonetheless it was very funny he said</p>
<p begin="02:57:46.160" end="02:57:48.950" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="02:57:46.820" end="02:57:51.820" style="s2">the most beautiful and intelligent way</p>
<p begin="02:57:48.950" end="02:57:53.841" style="s2">to say the dumbest things possible yeah</p>
<p begin="02:57:51.820" end="02:57:54.650" style="s2">well that was the nice part of what he</p>
<p begin="02:57:53.841" end="02:57:59.271" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="02:57:54.650" end="02:58:00.710" style="s2">but anyway you know I feel like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:57:59.271" end="02:58:03.051" style="s2">lost track and we&#39;re gonna have to wrap</p>
<p begin="02:58:00.710" end="02:58:05.420" style="s2">this up we&#39;re gonna lose our light well</p>
<p begin="02:58:03.051" end="02:58:08.690" style="s2">what is it Bret let me just ask you you</p>
<p begin="02:58:05.420" end="02:58:10.670" style="s2">have our open-ended thing we&#39;ve been at</p>
<p begin="02:58:08.690" end="02:58:12.381" style="s2">this we&#39;ve gotten a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="02:58:10.670" end="02:58:15.460" style="s2">attention if people wanted to know that</p>
<p begin="02:58:12.381" end="02:58:15.460" style="s2">we&#39;re here they know that we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="02:58:15.641" end="02:58:22.790" style="s2">something is going wrong yeah and it am</p>
<p begin="02:58:21.320" end="02:58:24.500" style="s2">I correct that we could blow up the</p>
<p begin="02:58:22.790" end="02:58:26.870" style="s2">entire planet we could find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="02:58:24.500" end="02:58:29.240" style="s2">a nuclear war over the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="02:58:26.870" end="02:58:34.311" style="s2">civil society shared meaning shared</p>
<p begin="02:58:29.240" end="02:58:38.631" style="s2">understanding yeah we are about to torch</p>
<p begin="02:58:34.311" end="02:58:40.940" style="s2">all of humanity potentially over very</p>
<p begin="02:58:38.631" end="02:58:44.990" style="s2">weird issues like do you understand and</p>
<p begin="02:58:40.940" end="02:58:46.700" style="s2">feel my pain it&#39;s and if you look at the</p>
<p begin="02:58:44.990" end="02:58:49.721" style="s2">prescriptions that we&#39;ve been handed as</p>
<p begin="02:58:46.700" end="02:58:54.230" style="s2">to what those who are advancing this a</p>
<p begin="02:58:49.721" end="02:58:57.051" style="s2">should be done next it is almost like we</p>
<p begin="02:58:54.230" end="02:58:59.181" style="s2">are being told that the ship we are on</p>
<p begin="02:58:57.051" end="02:59:01.311" style="s2">is flawed and if only we sink it a</p>
<p begin="02:58:59.181" end="02:59:04.700" style="s2">better one will come and it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="02:59:01.311" end="02:59:08.450" style="s2">right have you read an essay called ship</p>
<p begin="02:59:04.700" end="02:59:12.860" style="s2">of fools a short story by one Theodore</p>
<p begin="02:59:08.450" end="02:59:15.410" style="s2">Kaczynski I have not read the short</p>
<p begin="02:59:12.860" end="02:59:17.780" style="s2">story I didn&#39;t read the manifesto short</p>
<p begin="02:59:15.410" end="02:59:19.940" style="s2">story is about a ship on which there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:59:17.780" end="02:59:24.620" style="s2">cabin boy their first mates there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:59:19.940" end="02:59:25.460" style="s2">female passenger Mexicans and everybody</p>
<p begin="02:59:24.620" end="02:59:29.750" style="s2">on board</p>
<p begin="02:59:25.460" end="02:59:31.040" style="s2">is arguing about homosexuals aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:59:29.750" end="02:59:32.540" style="s2">being treated properly the women aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:59:31.040" end="02:59:33.830" style="s2">being treated properly the Mexicans</p>
<p begin="02:59:32.540" end="02:59:35.391" style="s2">aren&#39;t being treated properly and the</p>
<p begin="02:59:33.830" end="02:59:39.261" style="s2">cabin boy keeps saying we are sailing</p>
<p begin="02:59:35.391" end="02:59:41.240" style="s2">into an iceberg field and they keep</p>
<p begin="02:59:39.261" end="02:59:43.400" style="s2">having the same arguments over and over</p>
<p begin="02:59:41.240" end="02:59:45.261" style="s2">again and then at the end spontaneously</p>
<p begin="02:59:43.400" end="02:59:48.021" style="s2">and the ship hit an iceberg and sank and</p>
<p begin="02:59:45.261" end="02:59:48.740" style="s2">all hands were lost yep that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="02:59:48.021" end="02:59:52.431" style="s2">where we are</p>
<p begin="02:59:48.740" end="02:59:54.740" style="s2">so don&#39;t love quoting the Unabomber well</p>
<p begin="02:59:52.431" end="02:59:56.391" style="s2">I will tell you that inside of academia</p>
<p begin="02:59:54.740" end="02:59:57.530" style="s2">something very interesting happened with</p>
<p begin="02:59:56.391" end="02:59:59.570" style="s2">the Unabomber which is that we all</p>
<p begin="02:59:57.530" end="03:00:01.431" style="s2">understood that he was crazy and a small</p>
<p begin="02:59:59.570" end="03:00:04.070" style="s2">number of highly intellectual people</p>
<p begin="03:00:01.431" end="03:00:05.511" style="s2">looked at his manifesto anyway the point</p>
<p begin="03:00:04.070" end="03:00:07.820" style="s2">was actually some of the manifest it was</p>
<p begin="03:00:05.511" end="03:00:08.660" style="s2">perfectly juvenile right it was not high</p>
<p begin="03:00:07.820" end="03:00:10.521" style="s2">quality work</p>
<p begin="03:00:08.660" end="03:00:11.811" style="s2">not on some of it some was insightful</p>
<p begin="03:00:10.521" end="03:00:14.300" style="s2">some of it was insightful and this is</p>
<p begin="03:00:11.811" end="03:00:17.660" style="s2">partially the problem that a man driven</p>
<p begin="03:00:14.300" end="03:00:19.460" style="s2">half-mad through a partial insight and I</p>
<p begin="03:00:17.660" end="03:00:20.990" style="s2">should say that he blew off the hand of</p>
<p begin="03:00:19.460" end="03:00:21.920" style="s2">our mutual acquaintance david glenn</p>
<p begin="03:00:20.990" end="03:00:23.811" style="s2">tanner yep</p>
<p begin="03:00:21.920" end="03:00:26.120" style="s2">and so David Lerner who I think is a</p>
<p begin="03:00:23.811" end="03:00:27.590" style="s2">great guy and misunderstood and Ted</p>
<p begin="03:00:26.120" end="03:00:29.960" style="s2">Kaczynski&#39;s the son of a bitch yeah</p>
<p begin="03:00:27.590" end="03:00:32.150" style="s2">agree right so now we now we&#39;ve said the</p>
<p begin="03:00:29.960" end="03:00:33.830" style="s2">things that needed to be said yeah but</p>
<p begin="03:00:32.150" end="03:00:36.620" style="s2">there was insight they&#39;re smart people</p>
<p begin="03:00:33.830" end="03:00:39.440" style="s2">including dick Alexander we&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="03:00:36.620" end="03:00:41.330" style="s2">quick to dismiss the manifesto wholesale</p>
<p begin="03:00:39.440" end="03:00:43.460" style="s2">well in part you would expect somebody</p>
<p begin="03:00:41.330" end="03:00:45.950" style="s2">with a partial version of the truth to</p>
<p begin="03:00:43.460" end="03:00:47.450" style="s2">be driven insane yes very much so</p>
<p begin="03:00:45.950" end="03:00:49.521" style="s2">especially if isolated from others</p>
<p begin="03:00:47.450" end="03:00:54.590" style="s2">especially if it was it hard to see and</p>
<p begin="03:00:49.521" end="03:00:59.320" style="s2">hurt he was early yeah okay so let us</p>
<p begin="03:00:54.590" end="03:00:59.320" style="s2">say there&#39;s plenty more complement what</p>
<p begin="03:01:00.010" end="03:01:06.290" style="s2">yeah what is to get out kids you title</p>
<p begin="03:01:02.300" end="03:01:09.080" style="s2">all right well folks I have advanced a</p>
<p begin="03:01:06.290" end="03:01:12.620" style="s2">plan for starting to fix this in</p>
<p begin="03:01:09.080" end="03:01:16.670" style="s2">November check out Joe Rogan&#39;s clip</p>
<p begin="03:01:12.620" end="03:01:18.380" style="s2">channel for the Dark Horse duo strategy</p>
<p begin="03:01:16.670" end="03:01:20.601" style="s2">Dark Horse&#39;s the podcast but with the</p>
<p begin="03:01:18.380" end="03:01:23.960" style="s2">podcast it&#39;s Dark Horse with the H</p>
<p begin="03:01:20.601" end="03:01:25.910" style="s2">capitalized to the Dark Horse duo is not</p>
<p begin="03:01:23.960" end="03:01:27.470" style="s2">really about the Dark Horse podcast it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:01:25.910" end="03:01:29.061" style="s2">about the idea of Dark Horse&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:01:27.470" end="03:01:30.920" style="s2">which has a long and storied history</p>
<p begin="03:01:29.061" end="03:01:32.450" style="s2">relative to presidential candidates so</p>
<p begin="03:01:30.920" end="03:01:35.410" style="s2">it&#39;s almost an accident that the two of</p>
<p begin="03:01:32.450" end="03:01:38.960" style="s2">them line up but check out the clip and</p>
<p begin="03:01:35.410" end="03:01:42.260" style="s2">I think that this is the best plan we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="03:01:38.960" end="03:01:46.070" style="s2">got short term now the deepest plan we</p>
<p begin="03:01:42.260" end="03:01:47.840" style="s2">have this is a split ticket it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="03:01:46.070" end="03:01:50.870" style="s2">even a split ticket so one of the things</p>
<p begin="03:01:47.840" end="03:01:52.910" style="s2">I have learned in decades now of</p>
<p begin="03:01:50.870" end="03:01:53.990" style="s2">thinking about how to fix civilization</p>
<p begin="03:01:52.910" end="03:01:56.240" style="s2">is that there&#39;s certain things you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:01:53.990" end="03:01:57.470" style="s2">afford you can&#39;t afford a constitutional</p>
<p begin="03:01:56.240" end="03:01:59.630" style="s2">convention and you can&#39;t afford a</p>
<p begin="03:01:57.470" end="03:02:01.190" style="s2">revolution so you have to work within</p>
<p begin="03:01:59.630" end="03:02:03.290" style="s2">the structure you&#39;ve got but you have to</p>
<p begin="03:02:01.190" end="03:02:04.550" style="s2">think creatively about how to make the</p>
<p begin="03:02:03.290" end="03:02:06.500" style="s2">structure that you&#39;ve got how would I</p>
<p begin="03:02:04.550" end="03:02:09.290" style="s2">get a functional revolution without a</p>
<p begin="03:02:06.500" end="03:02:11.150" style="s2">physical road yeah we need revolutionary</p>
<p begin="03:02:09.290" end="03:02:12.920" style="s2">change without revolution and so the</p>
<p begin="03:02:11.150" end="03:02:13.490" style="s2">idea is I&#39;m in agreement with that part</p>
<p begin="03:02:12.920" end="03:02:14.990" style="s2">of it okay</p>
<p begin="03:02:13.490" end="03:02:17.271" style="s2">and I also believe that it cannot be</p>
<p begin="03:02:14.990" end="03:02:20.271" style="s2">Trump versus Biden canopy Trump versus</p>
<p begin="03:02:17.271" end="03:02:22.431" style="s2">bite in fact now that we are in kovat</p>
<p begin="03:02:20.271" end="03:02:24.801" style="s2">and George Floyd riots</p>
<p begin="03:02:22.431" end="03:02:27.230" style="s2">territory and we&#39;ve got these two is</p>
<p begin="03:02:24.801" end="03:02:29.421" style="s2">your strategy to pressure Biden to step</p>
<p begin="03:02:27.230" end="03:02:30.621" style="s2">back no it&#39;ll be one way but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:02:29.421" end="03:02:32.331" style="s2">think that&#39;ll happen because I think we</p>
<p begin="03:02:30.621" end="03:02:33.801" style="s2">know what the DNC is really about so I</p>
<p begin="03:02:32.331" end="03:02:35.721" style="s2">don&#39;t I think they will go down with the</p>
<p begin="03:02:33.801" end="03:02:39.200" style="s2">ship rather than allow I no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:02:35.721" end="03:02:40.911" style="s2">think with these style of demonstrations</p>
<p begin="03:02:39.200" end="03:02:42.740" style="s2">that that is something that I want to</p>
<p begin="03:02:40.911" end="03:02:44.721" style="s2">give away just you well I agree maybe</p>
<p begin="03:02:42.740" end="03:02:47.121" style="s2">they&#39;re steering time to ask for both of</p>
<p begin="03:02:44.721" end="03:02:50.711" style="s2">these people to retire because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:02:47.121" end="03:02:54.141" style="s2">too old to set in their ways too limited</p>
<p begin="03:02:50.711" end="03:02:55.700" style="s2">going downhill fast Jesus and Trump</p>
<p begin="03:02:54.141" end="03:02:57.980" style="s2">versus Biden you have a seventy-year-old</p>
<p begin="03:02:55.700" end="03:03:00.411" style="s2">versus like it&#39;s a ferry 74 year old</p>
<p begin="03:02:57.980" end="03:03:02.721" style="s2">versus a 77 year old we&#39;ve never had</p>
<p begin="03:03:00.411" end="03:03:05.271" style="s2">anything remotely look like that in</p>
<p begin="03:03:02.721" end="03:03:07.101" style="s2">American history yeah it&#39;s preposterous</p>
<p begin="03:03:05.271" end="03:03:09.291" style="s2">I mean let me just advance an idea that</p>
<p begin="03:03:07.101" end="03:03:11.421" style="s2">you should be expected to live 20 years</p>
<p begin="03:03:09.291" end="03:03:13.911" style="s2">with the consequences of your actions I</p>
<p begin="03:03:11.421" end="03:03:15.530" style="s2">like that I like that a lot</p>
<p begin="03:03:13.911" end="03:03:16.820" style="s2">you should be expected to live 20 years</p>
<p begin="03:03:15.530" end="03:03:18.681" style="s2">of the consequences of your actions so</p>
<p begin="03:03:16.820" end="03:03:20.480" style="s2">that you have you take responsibility</p>
<p begin="03:03:18.681" end="03:03:23.391" style="s2">for them rather than and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="03:03:20.480" end="03:03:25.101" style="s2">94 and 97 are expectations if I looked</p>
<p begin="03:03:23.391" end="03:03:26.690" style="s2">at a life table from an insurance</p>
<p begin="03:03:25.101" end="03:03:28.820" style="s2">company for these two gentlemen</p>
<p begin="03:03:26.690" end="03:03:30.051" style="s2">particularly not with cognitive problems</p>
<p begin="03:03:28.820" end="03:03:33.730" style="s2">I see in them both yeah</p>
<p begin="03:03:30.051" end="03:03:35.900" style="s2">right and that&#39;s before you get to their</p>
<p begin="03:03:33.730" end="03:03:39.650" style="s2">moral failings which are apparent in</p>
<p begin="03:03:35.900" end="03:03:41.030" style="s2">both cases so I mean off the stage yeah</p>
<p begin="03:03:39.650" end="03:03:42.591" style="s2">but nonetheless if they won&#39;t leave the</p>
<p begin="03:03:41.030" end="03:03:43.070" style="s2">stage we have to usher them off the</p>
<p begin="03:03:42.591" end="03:03:45.801" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="03:03:43.070" end="03:03:47.450" style="s2">so in short check out that clip on Joe</p>
<p begin="03:03:45.801" end="03:03:50.301" style="s2">Rogan&#39;s clip channel the short version</p>
<p begin="03:03:47.450" end="03:03:51.921" style="s2">is we draft to people who have three</p>
<p begin="03:03:50.301" end="03:03:54.261" style="s2">characteristics in common the</p>
<p begin="03:03:51.921" end="03:03:56.211" style="s2">characteristics are they are patriotic</p>
<p begin="03:03:54.261" end="03:03:57.980" style="s2">they are courageous and they are capable</p>
<p begin="03:03:56.211" end="03:03:59.751" style="s2">one of them has to come from the</p>
<p begin="03:03:57.980" end="03:04:01.161" style="s2">center-left one of them has to come from</p>
<p begin="03:03:59.751" end="03:04:04.041" style="s2">the center-right so that they dislike</p>
<p begin="03:04:01.161" end="03:04:06.171" style="s2">their wings more than they dislike the</p>
<p begin="03:04:04.041" end="03:04:08.271" style="s2">loyal opposition across the aisle right</p>
<p begin="03:04:06.171" end="03:04:10.221" style="s2">and decency will cause them to rule in</p>
<p begin="03:04:08.271" end="03:04:11.721" style="s2">our favor to govern in our favor now</p>
<p begin="03:04:10.221" end="03:04:14.001" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing we draft the two of</p>
<p begin="03:04:11.721" end="03:04:16.011" style="s2">them they flip a coin to decide which</p>
<p begin="03:04:14.001" end="03:04:19.311" style="s2">one is top of ticket but the agreement</p>
<p begin="03:04:16.011" end="03:04:22.311" style="s2">is that they govern by consensus except</p>
<p begin="03:04:19.311" end="03:04:24.891" style="s2">in two cases the two cases are cases</p>
<p begin="03:04:22.311" end="03:04:27.021" style="s2">where there&#39;s no time for dual</p>
<p begin="03:04:24.891" end="03:04:28.521" style="s2">decision-making and the other case is</p>
<p begin="03:04:27.021" end="03:04:30.291" style="s2">that they can&#39;t resolve something in</p>
<p begin="03:04:28.521" end="03:04:31.881" style="s2">which case somebody has to make a call</p>
<p begin="03:04:30.291" end="03:04:36.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s the person who inhabits the</p>
<p begin="03:04:31.881" end="03:04:39.520" style="s2">room you agree this is a Hail Mary no</p>
<p begin="03:04:36.460" end="03:04:42.359" style="s2">at this point I think we the Democrats</p>
<p begin="03:04:39.520" end="03:04:46.060" style="s2">and Republicans have surprisingly</p>
<p begin="03:04:42.359" end="03:04:48.850" style="s2">fumbled the ball so badly that they have</p>
<p begin="03:04:46.060" end="03:04:50.739" style="s2">in fact yeah but you should be looking</p>
<p begin="03:04:48.850" end="03:04:52.989" style="s2">for is something near violence in the</p>
<p begin="03:04:50.739" end="03:04:56.410" style="s2">streets no I&#39;m not kidding</p>
<p begin="03:04:52.989" end="03:04:58.359" style="s2">right every peaceful demonstration is a</p>
<p begin="03:04:56.410" end="03:05:00.370" style="s2">demonstration of potential violence</p>
<p begin="03:04:58.359" end="03:05:02.620" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand this right yeah</p>
<p begin="03:05:00.370" end="03:05:04.930" style="s2">right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a bit it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="03:05:02.620" end="03:05:07.660" style="s2">convertible threat it&#39;s a convertible</p>
<p begin="03:05:04.930" end="03:05:10.300" style="s2">threat and in our case we have the</p>
<p begin="03:05:07.660" end="03:05:12.939" style="s2">threat in the street and then we have a</p>
<p begin="03:05:10.300" end="03:05:15.699" style="s2">threat that we can all infer comes from</p>
<p begin="03:05:12.939" end="03:05:19.600" style="s2">the hills well why I was so upset about</p>
<p begin="03:05:15.699" end="03:05:21.819" style="s2">the looting because it&#39;s like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:05:19.600" end="03:05:24.640" style="s2">even keep your sword in its sheath in</p>
<p begin="03:05:21.819" end="03:05:26.770" style="s2">order to communicate power yeah where</p>
<p begin="03:05:24.640" end="03:05:30.760" style="s2">did you learn violence right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="03:05:26.770" end="03:05:32.350" style="s2">low grade wasteful so anyway we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="03:05:30.760" end="03:05:34.180" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a potential civil war on our</p>
<p begin="03:05:32.350" end="03:05:36.550" style="s2">hands which could be the uninvent of</p>
<p begin="03:05:34.180" end="03:05:38.500" style="s2">America very quickly so is it a Hail</p>
<p begin="03:05:36.550" end="03:05:41.080" style="s2">Mary no because I you know I will tell</p>
<p begin="03:05:38.500" end="03:05:43.359" style="s2">you I unveiled this idea first on my own</p>
<p begin="03:05:41.080" end="03:05:46.090" style="s2">podcast which has a moderate following</p>
<p begin="03:05:43.359" end="03:05:48.430" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t gotten a single negative</p>
<p begin="03:05:46.090" end="03:05:51.010" style="s2">reaction which I find interesting I</p>
<p begin="03:05:48.430" end="03:05:52.600" style="s2">think people are finally aware that all</p>
<p begin="03:05:51.010" end="03:05:55.330" style="s2">of the explanations of what is and isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:05:52.600" end="03:05:57.010" style="s2">possibly the easiest thing to say is no</p>
<p begin="03:05:55.330" end="03:05:59.439" style="s2">trump no Biden yeah</p>
<p begin="03:05:57.010" end="03:06:04.080" style="s2">no Trump no Biden is a strategy yep</p>
<p begin="03:05:59.439" end="03:06:07.180" style="s2">which is get these two old white</p>
<p begin="03:06:04.080" end="03:06:10.109" style="s2">maladapted has Ben&#39;s off the goddamn</p>
<p begin="03:06:07.180" end="03:06:13.300" style="s2">national and world stage period the end</p>
<p begin="03:06:10.109" end="03:06:17.260" style="s2">don&#39;t send me any like if you think</p>
<p begin="03:06:13.300" end="03:06:21.250" style="s2">about 2024 yeah the rules that say you</p>
<p begin="03:06:17.260" end="03:06:25.930" style="s2">are not allowed to participate in an</p>
<p begin="03:06:21.250" end="03:06:27.819" style="s2">event that we aren&#39;t behind and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:06:25.930" end="03:06:31.449" style="s2">gonna pick the New York Times and CNN</p>
<p begin="03:06:27.819" end="03:06:34.300" style="s2">and all the NPR to host the debates yeah</p>
<p begin="03:06:31.449" end="03:06:36.300" style="s2">there is no primary there&#39;s no primary</p>
<p begin="03:06:34.300" end="03:06:39.160" style="s2">at all there&#39;s no democracy it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="03:06:36.300" end="03:06:40.660" style="s2">right it&#39;s they were in inventing</p>
<p begin="03:06:39.160" end="03:06:43.720" style="s2">America and now the street is about to</p>
<p begin="03:06:40.660" end="03:06:46.689" style="s2">uninvent America and you know roughly</p>
<p begin="03:06:43.720" end="03:06:50.200" style="s2">speaking as much as I decry the stupid</p>
<p begin="03:06:46.689" end="03:06:52.479" style="s2">use of violence it&#39;s time for pitch</p>
<p begin="03:06:50.200" end="03:06:55.180" style="s2">it&#39;s time you know I&#39;ve said this on</p>
<p begin="03:06:52.479" end="03:06:57.160" style="s2">glass I said I said this on Rogan it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:06:55.180" end="03:06:59.080" style="s2">time to revolt yes</p>
<p begin="03:06:57.160" end="03:07:02.229" style="s2">but the problem is is that you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="03:06:59.080" end="03:07:03.670" style="s2">revolt better yes you&#39;re not a revolt</p>
<p begin="03:07:02.229" end="03:07:06.460" style="s2">better you know it can&#39;t all be about</p>
<p begin="03:07:03.670" end="03:07:08.529" style="s2">policing from some terrible thing that</p>
<p begin="03:07:06.460" end="03:07:10.390" style="s2">happened in Minneapolis and it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="03:07:08.529" end="03:07:13.120" style="s2">about policing where you think the smart</p>
<p begin="03:07:10.390" end="03:07:15.630" style="s2">reaction is to abolish the police rather</p>
<p begin="03:07:13.120" end="03:07:18.340" style="s2">than make them unnecessary by some means</p>
<p begin="03:07:15.630" end="03:07:19.950" style="s2">right you can&#39;t do it this way so okay</p>
<p begin="03:07:18.340" end="03:07:23.830" style="s2">you and I agree in fact I&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="03:07:19.950" end="03:07:26.439" style="s2">defeat Trump Biden in 2020 defeat Trump</p>
<p begin="03:07:23.830" end="03:07:28.180" style="s2">Trump Biden in 2020 so we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="03:07:26.439" end="03:07:29.649" style="s2">plan I have proposed to people it</p>
<p begin="03:07:28.180" end="03:07:31.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be these two people but</p>
<p begin="03:07:29.649" end="03:07:33.819" style="s2">I think they are viable and that they</p>
<p begin="03:07:31.090" end="03:07:35.500" style="s2">were the key thing is to get Trump and</p>
<p begin="03:07:33.819" end="03:07:35.859" style="s2">Biden to understand that we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="03:07:35.500" end="03:07:38.350" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="03:07:35.859" end="03:07:41.770" style="s2">yeah and that we only voted for Trump to</p>
<p begin="03:07:38.350" end="03:07:43.330" style="s2">get rid of Hillary you know I I talked</p>
<p begin="03:07:41.770" end="03:07:45.399" style="s2">about the old lady who swallowed a fly</p>
<p begin="03:07:43.330" end="03:07:48.670" style="s2">and I know a young I know a young nation</p>
<p begin="03:07:45.399" end="03:07:50.859" style="s2">that voted a trump right it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="03:07:48.670" end="03:07:53.170" style="s2">Hillary to bump they voted at Trump</p>
<p begin="03:07:50.859" end="03:07:55.180" style="s2">right and so the idea is like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:07:53.170" end="03:07:56.620" style="s2">want to swallow a series of crazier and</p>
<p begin="03:07:55.180" end="03:07:59.439" style="s2">crazier people to get rid of the last</p>
<p begin="03:07:56.620" end="03:08:01.989" style="s2">crazy person we have a ton of competent</p>
<p begin="03:07:59.439" end="03:08:05.739" style="s2">good decent people people who serve in</p>
<p begin="03:08:01.989" end="03:08:07.540" style="s2">our military yep people who devote their</p>
<p begin="03:08:05.739" end="03:08:10.750" style="s2">life to public service and we need to</p>
<p begin="03:08:07.540" end="03:08:14.560" style="s2">draft them and we in my write that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:08:10.750" end="03:08:17.170" style="s2">an imperative that whoever is put into</p>
<p begin="03:08:14.560" end="03:08:20.279" style="s2">power should be dead on arrival as far</p>
<p begin="03:08:17.170" end="03:08:22.779" style="s2">as the RLC in DNC oh yes like</p>
<p begin="03:08:20.279" end="03:08:24.520" style="s2">unacceptability to the gym those two</p>
<p begin="03:08:22.779" end="03:08:26.170" style="s2">entities don&#39;t hate you you&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="03:08:24.520" end="03:08:28.149" style="s2">enough for us it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="03:08:26.170" end="03:08:30.489" style="s2">you&#39;re good if they hate you right it is</p>
<p begin="03:08:28.149" end="03:08:33.180" style="s2">a necessary condition that they and the</p>
<p begin="03:08:30.489" end="03:08:37.239" style="s2">RNC should find you to be reprehensible</p>
<p begin="03:08:33.180" end="03:08:41.290" style="s2">childlike possessed of insane ideas yeah</p>
<p begin="03:08:37.239" end="03:08:44.080" style="s2">and the idea is like goddamn these two</p>
<p begin="03:08:41.290" end="03:08:47.859" style="s2">houses right a pox on both your houses</p>
<p begin="03:08:44.080" end="03:08:50.739" style="s2">now here&#39;s the thing there is also as</p>
<p begin="03:08:47.859" end="03:08:54.220" style="s2">terrifying as this is there is also the</p>
<p begin="03:08:50.739" end="03:08:57.399" style="s2">following possibility implied here that</p>
<p begin="03:08:54.220" end="03:08:59.319" style="s2">come November yeah we could feel better</p>
<p begin="03:08:57.399" end="03:09:01.540" style="s2">we could be headed towards something</p>
<p begin="03:08:59.319" end="03:09:03.790" style="s2">that looked to everybody like leadership</p>
<p begin="03:09:01.540" end="03:09:08.460" style="s2">of a kind we have not seen in</p>
