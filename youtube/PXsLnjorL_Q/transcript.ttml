<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:07.440" style="s2">all right hello welcome Lisa and Richie</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">to the solution raising of so many names</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.440" end="00:00:12.179" style="s2">for things on transportation and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t get discussed it for we went live</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.179" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna leave it open is just</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">transportation in general because it</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">could be goods or it could be people so</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">for the first 15 minutes he will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:25.800" style="s2">talking about what we currently do for</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">transportation both ourselves and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:30.420" style="s2">world right what we think is good about</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:31.949" style="s2">it what we think is bad about it and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.420" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">reason we only get 15 minutes is this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.949" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">generally what we concentrate on mostly</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">in society so we&#39;re just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:39.030" style="s2">rehashing things that we&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">talked about a lot or thought about a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.030" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">lot even if you haven&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">thought about transportation in general</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">so whoever would like to start can share</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">some thoughts on what you currently do</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">for transportation well do you need we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.510" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">need a certain amount of courage those</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">of us who are unprepared I can always</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">start well if you want to start that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:07.049" style="s2">fine if you want a fool to jump in where</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">angels fear to tread I&#39;m willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.049" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">the fool all right let&#39;s do that I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">love to hear your thoughts Lisa okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">well I&#39;ve been working with disaster</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">recovery I live in Northern California</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">and as you may know we&#39;ve had a number</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:24.290" style="s2">of fires which Psygnosis Richie you had</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:26.840" style="s2">in Australia as well and one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.290" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">transportation problems that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.840" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">has been transportation of goods</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">especially goods which volunteers want</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:38.579" style="s2">to give to disaster victims disaster</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">survivors victims is not politically</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.579" end="00:01:46.140" style="s2">correct but we&#39;ve had a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:48.119" style="s2">outpouring from private individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.140" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">want to clean their closets and some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.119" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">them want to give away their racks but</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">others want to give away really valuable</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:56.329" style="s2">clothing to people that have been wiped</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:56.329" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">so there&#39;s clothing there&#39;s furniture</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">there&#39;s household supplies there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">consumables there&#39;s food and often these</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:10.020" style="s2">are coming from out of the area actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">we got a shipment of I forgotten where</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.020" end="00:02:13.510" style="s2">the zero goes either ten thousand or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">hundred thousand two</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.510" end="00:02:19.780" style="s2">bulbs that were sent to the campfire in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:23.129" style="s2">Northern California to replant after the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.780" end="00:02:25.540" style="s2">fire which was a wonderful contribution</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.129" end="00:02:27.430" style="s2">but it&#39;s the content it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.540" end="00:02:30.519" style="s2">transportation when things are going</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.430" end="00:02:37.750" style="s2">from one person to another that was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.519" end="00:02:44.069" style="s2">real problem and it seemed to me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.750" end="00:02:47.140" style="s2">this is a sort of unvetted opinion that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.069" end="00:02:52.329" style="s2">what happened was the the agencies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.140" end="00:02:54.519" style="s2">were trying to organize relief for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.329" end="00:02:58.269" style="s2">people impacted by the disasters</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.519" end="00:03:00.730" style="s2">negatively impacted was that they felt</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.269" end="00:03:03.819" style="s2">like they have to be the storage depot</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.730" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">for all the donations so transportation</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.819" end="00:03:09.010" style="s2">was put first</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:15.099" style="s2">which meant well first was somebody said</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">I want to give a closet full of little</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.099" end="00:03:19.180" style="s2">children&#39;s clothes but I can&#39;t get them</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.650" end="00:03:21.430" style="s2">there so you have to arrange for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">transportation but but along with</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:27.819" style="s2">transportation is inventory or storage</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">which is the the one end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.819" end="00:03:36.519" style="s2">transportation and it seems like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:39.790" style="s2">of the agencies that wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.519" end="00:03:43.049" style="s2">helping agencies didn&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.790" end="00:03:46.359" style="s2">logistics of just-in-time delivery and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.049" end="00:03:49.359" style="s2">so I was advocating rather than put</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.359" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">transportation the goods are made are</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.359" end="00:03:55.060" style="s2">available at one source then immediately</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">you want to transport transport them</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.060" end="00:03:59.079" style="s2">then you have to warehouse them then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:04:03.090" style="s2">have to distribute them was to do a much</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.079" end="00:04:06.010" style="s2">more just-in-time kind of process where</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:08.260" style="s2">what the the agencies did was they</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.010" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">handled putting the donor and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.260" end="00:04:14.590" style="s2">recipient together so that they could</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">make their own arrangements for how they</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.590" end="00:04:19.959" style="s2">the goods got transported and it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:21.130" style="s2">be that you needed a third donor who</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.959" end="00:04:22.570" style="s2">would be someone who would donate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.130" end="00:04:24.760" style="s2">transportation whether they would donate</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.570" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">the funds for commercial shipping or</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.760" end="00:04:28.170" style="s2">whether they would</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:29.430" style="s2">what a dining room full of furniture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:33.000" style="s2">their pickup and drive it to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:35.880" style="s2">recipient I just think we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.000" end="00:04:40.670" style="s2">local transportation we could do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.880" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">more with volunteer with donation with</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.670" end="00:04:47.370" style="s2">doing not doing mass transportation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">the goods but doing individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.370" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">transportation and not necessarily using</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.390" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">commercial shipping so that&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.760" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">idea to throw out and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:03.480" style="s2">it&#39;s on topic or not yes I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">perfectly on topic you guys can hear me</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.480" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">right I just switched to the different</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like it there&#39;s a weird buzz in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">room more here so Richie do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">share do want me to sure yeah sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:16.230" style="s2">yeah so I mean the transportation that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:18.840" style="s2">use is mainly buses and trains at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.230" end="00:05:20.550" style="s2">moment I used to have a car and when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.840" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">was looking at New Zealand but I covered</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.550" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">in my car and yeah I&#39;m sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">organizing my life around public</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:31.050" style="s2">transport for the meantime partly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:33.200" style="s2">financially and partly just because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.050" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">know having a car as a pain in the ass</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.200" end="00:05:38.510" style="s2">but I mean the the system works pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">well here locally in Melbourne like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.510" end="00:05:43.950" style="s2">having your transportation connected</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.830" end="00:05:46.440" style="s2">with Google Maps it&#39;s just fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.950" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">really easy to get around I mean buses</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.440" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">are late in Italy every so often but</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:54.380" style="s2">it&#39;s generally a pretty reliable system</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:56.550" style="s2">especially given how huge the city is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.380" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">but yeah what was the other part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.550" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.910" end="00:06:03.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just what you&#39;re currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.200" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">for transportation or like Lisa talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.000" end="00:06:06.030" style="s2">about transportation of goods what this</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:09.620" style="s2">what&#39;s currently happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.030" end="00:06:16.320" style="s2">and what&#39;s good and bad about it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.620" end="00:06:18.750" style="s2">well yes of my personal trends yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.320" end="00:06:20.610" style="s2">my personal transportation is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.750" end="00:06:22.590" style="s2">effective for the users that I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.610" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">designed myself around the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.590" end="00:06:24.540" style="s2">are already there I think they&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.540" end="00:06:29.580" style="s2">I think traffic&#39;s probably quite a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:32.100" style="s2">nightmare so you know it would be good</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.580" end="00:06:35.000" style="s2">to see in the future less cars on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.100" end="00:06:39.180" style="s2">road more you know ride-sharing more</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.000" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2">those sorts of being able to just nobody</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.180" end="00:06:43.020" style="s2">owns a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">I just you know you just hire that when</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.020" end="00:06:48.060" style="s2">you need it that kind of thing but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:50.190" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we can sort of figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.060" end="00:06:52.770" style="s2">those systems and then the wider</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.190" end="00:06:57.950" style="s2">transportation system I&#39;m not very</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:06:59.760" style="s2">familiar with thanks for chief UM</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.950" end="00:07:01.230" style="s2">transportation something are given some</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.760" end="00:07:02.820" style="s2">thought to but it&#39;s not definitely one</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.820" end="00:07:07.860" style="s2">personally have a vehicle in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.850" end="00:07:09.420" style="s2">we have amazing public transit the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:10.920" style="s2">public transit doesn&#39;t work for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.420" end="00:07:12.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work with having a kid and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.920" end="00:07:14.850" style="s2">getting from door to door not with my</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.120" end="00:07:16.820" style="s2">disability so because I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.850" end="00:07:19.770" style="s2">enough money to drive an electric car I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.820" end="00:07:21.600" style="s2">end up buying like a $5,000 car and ends</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.600" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2">into the ground then get a new one and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:27.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t feel good as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:28.950" style="s2">environmentalist to be doing it that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.030" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">but it seems to be what&#39;s effective for</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.950" end="00:07:36.900" style="s2">my life I take a plane every four or</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:39.150" style="s2">five years to go visit family actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.900" end="00:07:41.669" style="s2">I&#39;m visiting family right now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.150" end="00:07:45.690" style="s2">the coronavirus and possibly going back</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.669" end="00:07:47.550" style="s2">to that Cooper early but the the cost as</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.690" end="00:07:52.520" style="s2">well as of course the environmental cost</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.550" end="00:07:55.560" style="s2">of plane travel is not sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.520" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">the I know with the transportation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.560" end="00:08:01.560" style="s2">goods it seems ridiculous that we like</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:04.290" style="s2">mine take the raw resources from one</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.560" end="00:08:05.880" style="s2">country and ship them to somewhere to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.290" end="00:08:07.140" style="s2">get to get manufactured ship them</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.880" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">somewhere else to get used and ship them</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.140" end="00:08:12.210" style="s2">back to get recycled or disposed of and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:14.310" style="s2">a lot of times it just makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.210" end="00:08:16.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like traveling back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.310" end="00:08:19.110" style="s2">across the globe several times and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.470" end="00:08:20.100" style="s2">not making stuff to last which is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.110" end="00:08:23.419" style="s2">this conversation or talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.100" end="00:08:25.830" style="s2">transportation but that that is all in</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.419" end="00:08:27.390" style="s2">embedded in the good that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.830" end="00:08:28.919" style="s2">designed to last and it&#39;s designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.390" end="00:08:31.350" style="s2">shipped all over the world so it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.919" end="00:08:33.390" style="s2">in one location which is very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.350" end="00:08:34.979" style="s2">it&#39;s very right now we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.390" end="00:08:37.110" style="s2">with with what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.979" end="00:08:39.780" style="s2">that if something is only made in one</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.110" end="00:08:41.460" style="s2">location what do you do and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.780" end="00:08:45.089" style="s2">make it especially if it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.460" end="00:08:47.730" style="s2">that is is life-saving and and very much</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.089" end="00:08:51.470" style="s2">needed like I know I supposedly the from</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.730" end="00:08:51.470" style="s2">the Joe Rogan podcast all of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.400" end="00:08:57.650" style="s2">dirtbags well can&#39;t think Ivy banks are</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:58.760" style="s2">made in the Dominican Republic and so if</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.650" end="00:09:00.500" style="s2">there was something that wiped it out</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.760" end="00:09:02.089" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing like there&#39;s nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.500" end="00:09:03.410" style="s2">else that makes them and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.089" end="00:09:05.390" style="s2">that was again was just on the children</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.410" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">podcast we have the doctor on talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:11.170" style="s2">about the pandemic and that is basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:16.100" style="s2">what I have to say about transportation</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.170" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2">right now and so now we can switch on to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.100" end="00:09:21.560" style="s2">the next piece if or if anyone else has</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:24.170" style="s2">anything to add for this one which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.560" end="00:09:28.870" style="s2">what is currently going on well I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.170" end="00:09:28.870" style="s2">I think one of the things we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">specify is what it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.150" end="00:09:38.060" style="s2">transporting where we&#39;re living in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:39.890" style="s2">age of information and I happen to be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.060" end="00:09:43.970" style="s2">educator so one of the things I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.890" end="00:09:47.000" style="s2">interested in is it when do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.970" end="00:09:50.300" style="s2">transport people and when can we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.000" end="00:09:53.000" style="s2">transport bits because so much of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.300" end="00:09:54.440" style="s2">we do is information and so we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.000" end="00:09:55.910" style="s2">a meeting here and we&#39;re transporting</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">bits we didn&#39;t have to transport the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.910" end="00:10:00.350" style="s2">people and we&#39;re spread all over the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:02.150" style="s2">place I don&#39;t know where you are to ibly</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.350" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">now isn&#39;t in your family but I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.150" end="00:10:06.550" style="s2">Northern California and Richie you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:09.350" style="s2">melbourne australia melbourne australia</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.550" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">and we can have a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:15.230" style="s2">meeting without transporting people on</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">the other hand there are huge numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.230" end="00:10:19.459" style="s2">things that can&#39;t be done without</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.529" style="s2">physical transportation of material</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.459" end="00:10:25.160" style="s2">things whether they are live things or</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.529" end="00:10:26.930" style="s2">inanimate objects so in some sense is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.160" end="00:10:31.880" style="s2">really address this question of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.930" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">transportation it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:35.270" style="s2">important to ask the question could this</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.560" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">be done with the transportation of bits</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.270" end="00:10:39.790" style="s2">are we are we talking about transporting</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:41.870" style="s2">something that&#39;s basically informational</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.790" end="00:10:44.980" style="s2">transporting something that&#39;s physical</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.870" end="00:10:47.540" style="s2">you know and you can&#39;t hug each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.980" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t transport the people but on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.540" end="00:10:51.589" style="s2">the other hand at this point we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.680" end="00:10:55.490" style="s2">supposed to be isolating so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.589" end="00:10:58.700" style="s2">best we can do but it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.490" end="00:11:00.740" style="s2">because we&#39;re now faced with some</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.700" end="00:11:03.079" style="s2">practical issues about online education</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.740" end="00:11:05.570" style="s2">where we&#39;re not physically transporting</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.079" end="00:11:08.930" style="s2">the books the papers were the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.570" end="00:11:12.709" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it all digital this could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.930" end="00:11:15.110" style="s2">a permanent you know way of being for</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.709" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">humans now because they reckon that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.110" end="00:11:19.070" style="s2">know they&#39;re not going to get past like</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">we there is a potential that we might</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.070" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">not get past this particular virus so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.959" end="00:11:24.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a chance that we&#39;re always going</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:26.839" style="s2">to have to make sure that we have some</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.680" end="00:11:29.899" style="s2">level of social distancing and ramp it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.839" end="00:11:32.899" style="s2">up you know wind when necessary so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.899" end="00:11:34.670" style="s2">we know it doesn&#39;t really begin which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.899" end="00:11:36.410" style="s2">just a terrifying situation because</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.670" end="00:11:39.290" style="s2">although this is a really good form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.410" end="00:11:40.970" style="s2">communication it&#39;s not being in-person</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.290" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">face-to-face being up to hug one another</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.970" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">being in one another&#39;s presence so this</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:50.540" style="s2">could be a big shift but it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:52.850" style="s2">about transit not have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.540" end="00:11:55.069" style="s2">these days that doesn&#39;t bring epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:11:57.860" style="s2">rotavirus in it it&#39;s our new world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.069" end="00:12:00.230" style="s2">yeah well I mean yeah brings up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.860" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">questions but how do we I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.230" end="00:12:05.060" style="s2">transportation that is another piece</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:07.459" style="s2">that is big is our global movement of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.060" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">people brings with it the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.459" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">pandemic that people can be in China one</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:13.910" style="s2">day and in California the next day and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.440" end="00:12:16.940" style="s2">in Paris the next day because they have</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.910" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">a jet-setting lifestyle causes this and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.940" end="00:12:23.510" style="s2">so if we&#39;re able to have a world where</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.889" style="s2">if this is our new normal people need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.510" end="00:12:26.569" style="s2">isolate for two weeks every time they</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.889" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">got off of any flight ever which means</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.569" end="00:12:31.130" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna really have a higher metric</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:34.490" style="s2">for am I gonna go visit right am I gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.130" end="00:12:36.260" style="s2">take two weeks at the end in order to to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.490" end="00:12:38.209" style="s2">make sure everybody&#39;s safe and having</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.260" end="00:12:39.290" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t socially distance and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.209" end="00:12:40.970" style="s2">stop hugging each other but we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.290" end="00:12:44.569" style="s2">smaller communities but again not</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.970" end="00:12:47.209" style="s2">transportations well it is in this if</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.569" end="00:12:48.980" style="s2">you think of one of the parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.209" end="00:12:51.079" style="s2">transportation as to how far you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.980" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">transport something whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.079" end="00:12:58.699" style="s2">person who are good if we had local</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.720" end="00:13:02.569" style="s2">communities where we knew that and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.699" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">let&#39;s play with your hypothesis that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.569" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">continue to have pandemic like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.230" end="00:13:12.139" style="s2">infections that we have to limit one can</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:14.839" style="s2">develop small local communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.139" end="00:13:17.300" style="s2">isolated so that you can have a human</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.839" end="00:13:19.370" style="s2">contact you can transport very locally</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.300" end="00:13:22.279" style="s2">but you don&#39;t transport globally</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.370" end="00:13:25.480" style="s2">without serious precautions so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.279" end="00:13:26.860" style="s2">something we might have to reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.480" end="00:13:29.150" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.860" end="00:13:32.300" style="s2">and what are the other things that comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.150" end="00:13:35.210" style="s2">to mind is also just of like the the non</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.300" end="00:13:36.920" style="s2">fragilities well the nine things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.210" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">can cause chaos to disrupt the system</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.920" end="00:13:41.660" style="s2">like we should be we should be preparing</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:43.460" style="s2">for these well in advance anyway because</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.660" end="00:13:45.080" style="s2">we knew pennant pandemics were going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.460" end="00:13:47.960" style="s2">be an issue that was gonna crop up at</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.080" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">some point in time and you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.960" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">way that we&#39;ve handled it you know as</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:54.020" style="s2">governments and institutions hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:56.870" style="s2">really didn&#39;t I mean I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.020" end="00:13:59.240" style="s2">given the circumstances but you know as</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.870" end="00:14:02.060" style="s2">a society we&#39;re just not aware of it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.240" end="00:14:03.800" style="s2">we haven&#39;t sort of like this issue about</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.060" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">how City sorry I&#39;m kind of derailing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.800" end="00:14:10.010" style="s2">this but like my tenure of my general</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">point is that you know systems like</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.010" end="00:14:15.500" style="s2">Transport are affected by you know these</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">these massive events and then how can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.500" end="00:14:19.580" style="s2">like I feel like going the local is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:30.290" style="s2">great place to go because that way we</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.580" end="00:14:34.730" style="s2">have more robustness in the face of go</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.290" end="00:14:37.190" style="s2">do what you need to do Richie I can drop</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.730" end="00:14:40.040" style="s2">you out just okay okay that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.190" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">that way he can them come back on camera</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.040" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">when he back up so he can continue on</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:47.810" style="s2">without him so we can shift into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:49.190" style="s2">next piece which is what does your they</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.810" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">don&#39;t need to match we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.190" end="00:14:53.000" style="s2">okay imma chronically agree on our</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">vision of the future but what is your</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.000" end="00:14:57.740" style="s2">perfect world look like for</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:59.510" style="s2">transportation 5 10 100 years out</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.740" end="00:15:02.650" style="s2">however long you need it to be out in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.510" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">order for it to be possible in your life</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.650" end="00:15:06.500" style="s2">from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:11.630" style="s2">again the parameters are really</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.500" end="00:15:13.580" style="s2">important what you transporting and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.630" end="00:15:15.320" style="s2">far you&#39;re transporting it so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.580" end="00:15:19.400" style="s2">already made two points one is we should</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.320" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">be looking at when we can do transport</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.400" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">digitally when we can use our digital</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:29.720" style="s2">platforms to more carefully deal with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:32.990" style="s2">the physical transportation problem and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.720" end="00:15:38.740" style="s2">uber and lyft are good examples of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.990" end="00:15:41.810" style="s2">new ways of handling transportation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.740" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">so ideally we would use all the tools</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.810" end="00:15:49.459" style="s2">that we have developed in the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:52.070" style="s2">years to manage our transportation</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.459" end="00:16:01.190" style="s2">systems better and we would also</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.070" end="00:16:04.790" style="s2">understand the the value of functioning</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.190" end="00:16:08.990" style="s2">locally it&#39;s almost like we&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.790" end="00:16:13.190" style="s2">thrall of the potential of global travel</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.990" end="00:16:15.950" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve been experimenting for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.190" end="00:16:18.980" style="s2">couple hundred years with all the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.950" end="00:16:21.140" style="s2">we can do with global travel and now</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.980" end="00:16:23.570" style="s2">that we&#39;ve explored that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.140" end="00:16:26.390" style="s2">that we can do lots of very exciting</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.570" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">wonderful things with global travel now</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.390" end="00:16:33.100" style="s2">we&#39;re in a kind of evaluative phase so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:37.010" style="s2">see the future as us really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.100" end="00:16:40.190" style="s2">the actions that our modern technologies</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.010" end="00:16:41.779" style="s2">have enabled and deciding which ones we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.190" end="00:16:44.300" style="s2">want to use and how we want to use them</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.779" end="00:16:47.390" style="s2">what and we&#39;re looking at one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.300" end="00:16:51.740" style="s2">negative consequences of this wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.390" end="00:16:53.240" style="s2">global travel and we don&#39;t want to throw</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.740" end="00:16:56.980" style="s2">the baby out with the bathwater by</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.240" end="00:17:00.110" style="s2">throwing out all of global travel but a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.980" end="00:17:02.510" style="s2">lot of careful thought needs to go into</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.110" end="00:17:04.610" style="s2">when do we need to manufacture locally</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.510" end="00:17:10.939" style="s2">when do we need and therefore transport</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.610" end="00:17:15.050" style="s2">locally when do we need to what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.939" end="00:17:17.449" style="s2">carbon footprint of transporting so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.050" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the the global warming is one</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.449" end="00:17:23.079" style="s2">negative consequences of having</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">exploited all the transportation</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.079" end="00:17:29.179" style="s2">technologies that we have and we really</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:31.220" style="s2">need to sit back and evaluate which ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.179" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">are worth continuing with and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.220" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">are worth getting rid of right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:40.040" style="s2">those are all very good points</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">my ideal version of transportation in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.040" end="00:17:43.340" style="s2">the future it&#39;s weird because here you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:44.690" style="s2">talk I was like right this one piece I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.340" end="00:17:46.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I want it anymore which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.690" end="00:17:48.140" style="s2">rapid rail trap</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:50.540" style="s2">trouble right being able to get from</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.140" end="00:17:53.140" style="s2">California to New York in a few hours on</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.540" end="00:17:55.220" style="s2">the ground I do think it&#39;s somewhat more</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.140" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">safe because you don&#39;t have the recycled</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.220" end="00:17:59.960" style="s2">air but the speed of it is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:01.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s also what connects us and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:03.410" style="s2">makes it helpful I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.340" end="00:18:07.040" style="s2">needed you Richie so many of you excited</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.410" end="00:18:08.660" style="s2">off you can invite me to jihad and but</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.040" end="00:18:11.110" style="s2">having the ability to get somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.660" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">without taking off and landing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.110" end="00:18:16.820" style="s2">possibly having big ships they transport</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:19.220" style="s2">across the the Atlantic or having</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.820" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">massive rail that goes underwater or</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.220" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">overwater I don&#39;t know what that is but</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">have you noticed sorry</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:27.410" style="s2">through tunnels through tunnels yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:29.210" style="s2">having it be the ability to actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.410" end="00:18:31.070" style="s2">have massive what I would like</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.210" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">personally is I would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.070" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">access to a car I would like it to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">autonomous I would like it to drive me</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">somewhere and I would like to say where</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:39.260" style="s2">I need to get picked up and dropped off</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:41.420" style="s2">and I don&#39;t care if there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.260" end="00:18:42.890" style="s2">else in that car with me but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.420" end="00:18:46.040" style="s2">be able to get dropped off from point A</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.890" end="00:18:49.460" style="s2">to point B also be able to state whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.040" end="00:18:51.020" style="s2">it&#39;s within like whether someone&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.020" end="00:18:55.010" style="s2">it like having make sure that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.730" end="00:18:59.000" style="s2">diverse that there&#39;s a vehicle that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:19:00.710" style="s2">everyone can use and then I can get</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.000" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">stuff done in the car if I need to and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.710" end="00:19:04.700" style="s2">then also what you had had stay at leas</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:07.340" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good point making sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.700" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">that whatever can be done in bits is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.340" end="00:19:11.810" style="s2">done in bits that being able to live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:13.970" style="s2">a local community as is part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.810" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">would love to have in the future and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.970" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2">would like to live there and spend 99</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:20.150" style="s2">percent of my time there and incept when</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:21.920" style="s2">I go and visit family or family come to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.150" end="00:19:23.960" style="s2">visits me but I want to connect it to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.920" end="00:19:25.940" style="s2">the globe in talking and I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.960" end="00:19:28.310" style="s2">able to solve problems together and have</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.940" end="00:19:30.530" style="s2">deep discussions on things that interest</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.310" end="00:19:31.610" style="s2">me and if my community doesn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.530" end="00:19:32.690" style="s2">about the things I want to talk about I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.610" end="00:19:34.070" style="s2">want to be able to find people around</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.690" end="00:19:36.890" style="s2">the globe and that&#39;s the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.070" end="00:19:40.760" style="s2">that that I can do online and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.890" end="00:19:43.700" style="s2">that the more we start I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.760" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">word is propping up we&#39;d like your</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:46.670" style="s2">looked at is affluence and privileged if</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:48.290" style="s2">you&#39;re able to travel around the globe</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.670" end="00:19:49.550" style="s2">that you&#39;ve like been to Paris you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.290" end="00:19:51.800" style="s2">been to Russia that you&#39;ve been to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.550" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">Africa and if that&#39;s no longer the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.800" end="00:19:56.380" style="s2">and instead it&#39;s like listen I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:59.750" style="s2">experienced Paris in VR I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.380" end="00:20:02.270" style="s2">walking up Kilimanjaro in the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.750" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a we don&#39;t need to all trace about</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.270" end="00:20:05.090" style="s2">the globe and I can still feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:08.900" style="s2">had that experience because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.090" end="00:20:10.340" style="s2">about whether or not I&#39;m better than</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.340" end="00:20:12.890" style="s2">like I had that experience then someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.780" end="00:20:14.419" style="s2">else like where I would really like to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.890" end="00:20:15.559" style="s2">go in person because my grandmother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.419" end="00:20:17.150" style="s2">been there my sister&#39;s been there as</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.559" end="00:20:18.650" style="s2">Machu Picchu and so there are some that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.150" end="00:20:20.419" style="s2">I would put at a higher level that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.650" end="00:20:22.220" style="s2">like no I really want to physically go</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.419" end="00:20:23.780" style="s2">there Paris though where I could like</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.220" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">mute the sound and walk through the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.780" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">streets thank you VR would be perfect be</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:29.450" style="s2">able to go to the museum&#39;s and feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:30.919" style="s2">you&#39;re right there in front of it you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.450" end="00:20:32.870" style="s2">have you know the whole the whole Louvre</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.919" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">to yourself and you can look around or</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.870" end="00:20:37.159" style="s2">you can add the people whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">it makes sense to use so that is what a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.159" end="00:20:40.820" style="s2">bit of my oh and one more thing which</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:43.820" style="s2">was that when we owned cars together</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.820" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">they&#39;re designed to be to last where</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.820" end="00:20:48.049" style="s2">like you the engine&#39;s easy to be put in</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:49.640" style="s2">and take it out if it&#39;s an engine I just</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.049" end="00:20:51.980" style="s2">said electric cars but like that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.640" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">type of work they&#39;re designed to last</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.980" end="00:20:56.630" style="s2">and the components to be replaced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:59.210" style="s2">my version of an ideal future I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.630" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">like to to live in how about you Richie</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.210" end="00:21:04.669" style="s2">welcome back yeah I&#39;ve been like I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">transportation isn&#39;t really an issue if</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.669" end="00:21:08.090" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t have too much</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">transportation on the road and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.090" end="00:21:11.929" style="s2">like the way that we power it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:13.580" style="s2">negative to our environment so if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.929" end="00:21:17.780" style="s2">got electric cars that are powered on</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.580" end="00:21:20.030" style="s2">fusion reactors like like not fusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.780" end="00:21:21.320" style="s2">reactions within the car but like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.030" end="00:21:22.610" style="s2">know it&#39;s not fossil fuels that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.320" end="00:21:24.919" style="s2">burning in order to fuel to her power</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.610" end="00:21:27.650" style="s2">that thing then you know we can have as</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.919" end="00:21:29.809" style="s2">much transportation as we like and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.650" end="00:21:31.669" style="s2">know if we can recycle old vehicles and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.809" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">turn them into new vehicles if that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.669" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to do that economically</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.730" style="s2">then we should do that but I mean really</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:41.780" style="s2">this for me the soy just comes back down</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.730" end="00:21:43.490" style="s2">to things need to change like on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.780" end="00:21:45.080" style="s2">individual level in the community level</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.490" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">like we just need it need a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.080" end="00:21:49.250" style="s2">philosophy of how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:51.409" style="s2">organize ourselves within society</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.250" end="00:21:53.270" style="s2">because you know just you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.409" end="00:21:58.309" style="s2">manufacturing new cars and having to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.270" end="00:22:00.650" style="s2">have like the like having to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.309" end="00:22:02.870" style="s2">sell you know a million cars in order to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.650" end="00:22:04.190" style="s2">prototype the next car or like those</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.870" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">kinds of things like it&#39;s just such a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.190" end="00:22:07.789" style="s2">waste like it&#39;s so much so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:11.059" style="s2">resources that we&#39;re just throwing away</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.789" end="00:22:12.130" style="s2">and maybe we can do it over you know 300</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.059" end="00:22:14.830" style="s2">400 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.130" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">but like what is what is the resource</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.830" end="00:22:21.430" style="s2">cycle for all of those components like</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:24.370" style="s2">like fossil fuel the the resource cycle</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.430" end="00:22:26.800" style="s2">is so long so you can&#39;t really you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.370" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">use use that stuff and then reuse it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.800" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">again in you know 50 years or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:35.680" style="s2">it takes a long time to be for that to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:36.250" style="s2">be reusable so yeah new things to change</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.680" end="00:22:37.900" style="s2">but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.250" end="00:22:44.170" style="s2">electric cars shared electric cars with</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.900" end="00:22:45.580" style="s2">like specific you know scenes and spaces</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.170" end="00:22:49.510" style="s2">and those those kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:52.180" style="s2">sounds great and Leslie the lease people</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.510" end="00:22:53.740" style="s2">who are stuck in traffic for you know X</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.180" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">amount of time in their lives the better</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.740" end="00:22:56.520" style="s2">because that&#39;s just you know really</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:59.770" style="s2">ditch when we do it for people I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.520" end="00:23:01.750" style="s2">yeah I think like if life looked like it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.770" end="00:23:03.790" style="s2">looks now where people are living in</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.750" end="00:23:05.770" style="s2">suburbs and driving into the city be</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.790" end="00:23:07.750" style="s2">able to connect cars together where they</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.770" end="00:23:09.130" style="s2">were able to be more efficient and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.750" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">you know and they communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.130" end="00:23:12.850" style="s2">other to see they knew where one was</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:14.590" style="s2">getting off so it could be faster but</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.850" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">also I don&#39;t want to live in a suburb</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.590" end="00:23:18.940" style="s2">and drive into the city I want to live</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:21.100" style="s2">in my community I want to like work</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.940" end="00:23:24.550" style="s2">online with people around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.100" end="00:23:26.890" style="s2">I want to play music and eat and connect</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.550" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">and you know raise our kids with a small</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.890" end="00:23:30.790" style="s2">community that we walk in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:32.710" style="s2">maybe bike you know like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.790" end="00:23:35.050" style="s2">even doable and be surrounded by nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.710" end="00:23:36.460" style="s2">and spend most of my time in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.050" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">community in the surrounding area is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.460" end="00:23:39.430" style="s2">what I would prefer but other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">prefer to live in the city and I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.430" end="00:23:44.800" style="s2">people to have diversity well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:47.320" style="s2">what I had the privilege of doing so</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.800" end="00:23:51.040" style="s2">come come to Northern California yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.320" end="00:23:53.260" style="s2">actually no it won&#39;t be rural if too</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.040" end="00:23:55.450" style="s2">many people come I wanted to just</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.260" end="00:23:56.920" style="s2">mention an invention that I worked on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.450" end="00:23:59.680" style="s2">couple of years ago several years ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.920" end="00:24:02.170" style="s2">now but which was I got through the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.680" end="00:24:03.870" style="s2">stage we never built a prototype but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.170" end="00:24:06.910" style="s2">would be a personal transportation pod</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.870" end="00:24:11.010" style="s2">which would be like the interior of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.910" end="00:24:14.740" style="s2">small car a to earth two-person car</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.010" end="00:24:17.230" style="s2">which is what you owned and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.740" end="00:24:20.410" style="s2">could attach that to what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.230" end="00:24:24.310" style="s2">truck which is like the wheels the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.410" end="00:24:25.570" style="s2">bottom that it could either go into an</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.310" end="00:24:28.240" style="s2">onto an individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.570" end="00:24:30.160" style="s2">or it could go onto a train or it could</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">go onto an air vehicle or it could go</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.160" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">onto a boat so that you didn&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:40.210" style="s2">not a single purpose transportation</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">vehicle and it should be comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.210" end="00:24:47.890" style="s2">enough so that you might want to use it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:49.990" style="s2">for your office as well and so that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.890" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">kind of piggybacks on your idea of well</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.990" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">they should attach together because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:59.560" style="s2">could put it on a connected train that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:01.420" style="s2">runs on the road as compared with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.560" end="00:25:04.450" style="s2">train that runs on a track but you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.420" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">do either if you had the transportation</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.450" end="00:25:09.940" style="s2">pod so I don&#39;t know if anybody&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:11.230" style="s2">on that or not but it&#39;s an idea that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.940" end="00:25:14.200" style="s2">perfectly willing to throw out into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.230" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">universe and see if anybody else - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:18.010" style="s2">a cool idea I like it um like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:19.270" style="s2">affect you I also wanted to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.010" end="00:25:20.860" style="s2">although it&#39;s not directly related to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.270" end="00:25:21.940" style="s2">transportation is related to not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.860" end="00:25:25.060" style="s2">transporting goods</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.940" end="00:25:28.900" style="s2">James Jones&#39;s project cube spawn of</p>

<p begin="00:25:28.900" end="00:25:34.330" style="s2">manufacture basically anything further</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.970" end="00:25:36.310" style="s2">where it&#39;s like a Lego effect it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.310" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">is Lego where you can put these pieces</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.820" end="00:25:51.130" style="s2">and I think having one of those in every</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:54.160" style="s2">community so that you can print it there</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.130" end="00:25:55.990" style="s2">and manufactured there and manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.160" end="00:25:58.420" style="s2">and the quantity wants and need as</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.990" end="00:25:59.890" style="s2">opposed to having it be be shipped and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.420" end="00:26:02.190" style="s2">then we can have some things that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.890" end="00:26:04.630" style="s2">make sense you need that way made more</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.190" end="00:26:06.760" style="s2">redundant so that you aren&#39;t having that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.630" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">that fragility but have you know at</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:18.250" style="s2">mm-hmm it&#39;s kind of like every every</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.360" end="00:26:25.300" style="s2">community needs its own maker space</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.480" end="00:26:41.320" style="s2">but also welders that can be bought</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.399" end="00:26:46.149" style="s2">borrowed and an auto shop that can be</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.799" end="00:26:59.589" style="s2">one here in Edmonton but having the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.149" end="00:27:01.539" style="s2">barrier of not having your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.589" end="00:27:03.249" style="s2">vehicle having it be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.539" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">delivered having that you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.249" end="00:27:06.279" style="s2">sewing machine and have it dropped off</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.529" style="s2">to you and picked up to you and the more</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.279" end="00:27:10.599" style="s2">were able I on this thing in my head</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.529" end="00:27:12.940" style="s2">called the hub I was calling him her</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.599" end="00:27:14.409" style="s2">every person it was like an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.940" end="00:27:16.570" style="s2">to Amazon where you could bake cookies</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.409" end="00:27:20.589" style="s2">in your house and Silva or you know jam</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.570" end="00:27:23.649" style="s2">or crafts of any kind in every every</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.589" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">everyday or at once a week depending on</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.649" end="00:27:27.639" style="s2">the threshold of people you had a pickup</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:29.379" style="s2">in a drop-off so whatever you made was</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.639" end="00:27:31.119" style="s2">picked up and given to it brought back</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.379" end="00:27:33.820" style="s2">to the hub and then just first to the to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.119" end="00:27:36.759" style="s2">the customers or other members I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.820" end="00:27:39.009" style="s2">like their customers and then you got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.759" end="00:27:40.599" style="s2">delivery and a pickup is the point so</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.009" end="00:27:41.859" style="s2">you could it was a lot easier if you had</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.599" end="00:27:43.629" style="s2">an adventure you don&#39;t have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.859" end="00:27:46.899" style="s2">out how to get it to person and things</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.629" end="00:27:49.239" style="s2">like to libraries and goods libraries</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.899" end="00:27:50.589" style="s2">could also be used in that way where hey</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.239" end="00:27:52.029" style="s2">my friend has a book across town and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.589" end="00:27:53.589" style="s2">said a meeting to go pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.029" end="00:27:58.389" style="s2">I just know she&#39;ll put it in her next</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.589" end="00:28:00.279" style="s2">delivery and it will make it to me again</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.389" end="00:28:04.950" style="s2">this is sort of a supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.279" end="00:28:07.929" style="s2">management which is what&#39;s behind</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.950" end="00:28:10.299" style="s2">transportation and then since you</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.929" end="00:28:12.190" style="s2">mentioned baking cookies at home another</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.299" end="00:28:15.580" style="s2">issue that has to be dealt with is all</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:17.259" style="s2">the regulation which is although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.580" end="00:28:19.929" style="s2">not transportation in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.259" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not a car or a train or a truck or</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.929" end="00:28:24.759" style="s2">an airplane it is we do have to when we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:28.479" style="s2">discuss transportation we have to look</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.759" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">at all of the regulations that make it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.479" end="00:28:39.029" style="s2">possible to transport and have everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:42.059" style="s2">participate in in a coordinated system</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.029" end="00:28:45.429" style="s2">so along with the discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.059" end="00:28:48.039" style="s2">transportation of people in material</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.429" end="00:28:51.190" style="s2">things to talk about the regulations</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.039" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">around that and how to govern it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.190" end="00:28:54.270" style="s2">was like allowed to sell the cookies</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.980" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.270" end="00:28:58.180" style="s2">baked in your own kitchen yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.980" end="00:29:00.400" style="s2">you would leave allowed to give them</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.180" end="00:29:02.290" style="s2">away why Mike if it&#39;s just I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.400" end="00:29:03.490" style="s2">bake them and I&#39;m who wants them and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.290" end="00:29:05.500" style="s2">then I&#39;m giving them ways that different</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.490" end="00:29:06.850" style="s2">regulations and if we want to bake mass</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.500" end="00:29:08.860" style="s2">amounts of cookies do we need a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.850" end="00:29:10.930" style="s2">commercial kitchen and then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.860" end="00:29:13.630" style="s2">coordinate that and so well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.930" end="00:29:15.040" style="s2">transportation as you said it is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.630" end="00:29:17.680" style="s2">system that&#39;s going to be using the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.040" end="00:29:19.180" style="s2">transportation and how efficiently we</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.680" end="00:29:21.910" style="s2">can do we can do all of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.180" end="00:29:26.110" style="s2">yeah consumer whatever that word is in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.910" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">better world and a maker a maker and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.110" end="00:29:34.450" style="s2">user right of various various goods and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:36.190" style="s2">services and that like although that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.450" end="00:29:38.410" style="s2">not transportation being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.190" end="00:29:39.940" style="s2">like a hair dress or come to your</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.410" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">community as opposed to everyone going</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.940" end="00:29:45.550" style="s2">out to the hairdresser having um I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:46.900" style="s2">if you&#39;re in a 300 person community you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.550" end="00:29:50.170" style="s2">probably have a hairdresser there but</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.900" end="00:29:52.600" style="s2">having a massage therapist come out</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.170" end="00:29:54.160" style="s2">having someone come out that is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.600" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">traveling to you one time and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.160" end="00:29:56.710" style="s2">it&#39;s much more efficient for them</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:57.010" style="s2">because they&#39;re seen one person after</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.710" end="00:29:58.750" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.010" end="00:30:03.220" style="s2">clearly not during this time period and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.750" end="00:30:05.710" style="s2">then um yeah that transporting one</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.220" end="00:30:07.390" style="s2">person as opposed to a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.710" end="00:30:13.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not bits but it&#39;s more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.390" end="00:30:15.640" style="s2">mm-hmm okay so we&#39;re at the 30 minute</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.000" end="00:30:17.110" style="s2">mark so now we get to transfer over to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.640" end="00:30:19.420" style="s2">the other unless someone has closing</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.110" end="00:30:20.950" style="s2">statements which lets us that first does</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.420" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">anybody have any closing statements for</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.950" end="00:30:28.680" style="s2">a world they would like to create its</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:32.050" style="s2">contingent on a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.680" end="00:30:34.690" style="s2">yeah but now we&#39;re gonna get to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.050" end="00:30:36.520" style="s2">like tangent the adjacent possible so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.690" end="00:30:39.670" style="s2">now we&#39;re gonna talk about what could we</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.520" end="00:30:41.020" style="s2">do with 10,000 people and hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.670" end="00:30:43.480" style="s2">thousand dollars that could either be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.020" end="00:30:45.190" style="s2">global 10,000 people to something like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.480" end="00:30:47.320" style="s2">nap or I don&#39;t know what that would look</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.190" end="00:30:49.870" style="s2">like for transportation or it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.320" end="00:30:52.540" style="s2">local 10,000 right 10,000 in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.870" end="00:30:54.550" style="s2">10,000 in Northern California 10,000 in</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.540" end="00:30:56.500" style="s2">Sydney a bigger in Melbourne actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.550" end="00:30:59.530" style="s2">aren&#39;t you 10,000 a Melbourne like</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.500" end="00:31:01.510" style="s2">having an but just that metric because</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.530" end="00:31:02.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a doable thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.510" end="00:31:05.950" style="s2">something that you&#39;re on I mean isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.800" end="00:31:06.820" style="s2">let&#39;s redesign our entire transportation</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.950" end="00:31:08.710" style="s2">system what</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.820" end="00:31:17.620" style="s2">we actually do with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.710" end="00:31:23.019" style="s2">$100,000 well we certainly have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.620" end="00:31:25.990" style="s2">example of the rideshare services and in</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.019" end="00:31:27.340" style="s2">a lot of senses we not only are talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.990" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">about the transportation of goods we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.340" end="00:31:33.009" style="s2">also talking about the transportation of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:36.460" style="s2">services so moving and this has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.009" end="00:31:41.559" style="s2">going on for 30 40 years is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.460" end="00:31:43.809" style="s2">conceptualize to think about what used</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.559" end="00:31:45.429" style="s2">to be thought of as a product a physical</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.809" end="00:31:47.700" style="s2">product that got sold as a service</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.429" end="00:31:50.980" style="s2">that&#39;s being sold and of course their</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.700" end="00:31:54.190" style="s2">paradigmatic example is flooring is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.980" end="00:31:56.169" style="s2">carpeting services so instead of selling</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.190" end="00:31:58.419" style="s2">carpets you sell carpeting services in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.169" end="00:32:00.759" style="s2">company that sells them handles the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.419" end="00:32:05.620" style="s2">transportation the manufacturer the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.759" end="00:32:08.200" style="s2">transportation the installation and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.620" end="00:32:13.029" style="s2">removal and end of product life</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.200" end="00:32:15.929" style="s2">recycling so they&#39;ve sold us the service</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.029" end="00:32:18.190" style="s2">of carpeting rather than the carpet and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.929" end="00:32:19.210" style="s2">you could think about that in terms well</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.190" end="00:32:21.220" style="s2">here addressing you could think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.210" end="00:32:23.470" style="s2">that in terms of taxi service which has</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.220" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">always been a service but you can think</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.470" end="00:32:29.169" style="s2">of the taxi or you can think of the taxi</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:31.000" style="s2">service so in some senses its</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.169" end="00:32:34.210" style="s2">specifically in transportation that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.000" end="00:32:37.570" style="s2">experiments been done with uber and lyft</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.210" end="00:32:40.179" style="s2">and the other ride-sharing services and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.570" end="00:32:43.750" style="s2">now you&#39;ve talked about the hub concept</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.179" end="00:32:48.250" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that with with home produced</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.750" end="00:32:50.169" style="s2">services going to a hub and coming back</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.250" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">and those are all things you can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.169" end="00:32:54.279" style="s2">thing you can do lots and lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">with with at the scale that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.279" end="00:32:58.710" style="s2">talking about which is you said ten</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:33:01.750" style="s2">thousand people in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.710" end="00:33:03.549" style="s2">yeah yeah there are tons of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.750" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">possibilities and that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.549" end="00:33:07.210" style="s2">this process it&#39;s not just to pick one</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">it&#39;s to kind of just generate all of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:10.840" style="s2">possibilities we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:12.700" style="s2">transportation and then when our next</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.840" end="00:33:14.289" style="s2">step when we figured this out a while</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.700" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">then we can pick one and actually make</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.289" end="00:33:18.639" style="s2">it together find 10,000 people each put</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.480" end="00:33:20.680" style="s2">in ten bucks and actually make it but</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.639" end="00:33:23.260" style="s2">right now it&#39;s yeah because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.680" end="00:33:25.950" style="s2">creating a cooperatively owned upper or</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.260" end="00:33:32.980" style="s2">left where the drivers are looked after</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.950" end="00:33:34.900" style="s2">and as the user we can problem solve</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.980" end="00:33:37.450" style="s2">together to make it more efficient so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.900" end="00:33:40.540" style="s2">can&#39;t afford lyft and uber but I might</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.450" end="00:33:42.310" style="s2">be able to cart a crowd to share a car</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.540" end="00:33:44.050" style="s2">with let&#39;s new right if I&#39;m coming home</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.310" end="00:33:47.080" style="s2">from a concert instead of it being surge</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.050" end="00:33:48.910" style="s2">pricing be like okay well if we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.080" end="00:33:50.710" style="s2">to be connected on app and it could say</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.910" end="00:33:52.810" style="s2">hey four of us are going home together</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.710" end="00:33:54.280" style="s2">and so it&#39;s gonna be one third of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.810" end="00:33:56.440" style="s2">price the drivers gonna make more but</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.280" end="00:33:58.330" style="s2">we&#39;re all gonna pay less again clearly</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.440" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">not in this climate but like those kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.330" end="00:34:03.310" style="s2">of solutions when we figured out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:06.790" style="s2">tactic so not only do you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.310" end="00:34:08.290" style="s2">the platform for the contacting the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.790" end="00:34:11.830" style="s2">driver and getting the driver to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.290" end="00:34:13.090" style="s2">customer but the customer cohort has to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.830" end="00:34:15.820" style="s2">be able to get in touch with each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.090" end="00:34:19.270" style="s2">so that if I&#39;m at this San Francisco</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.820" end="00:34:23.020" style="s2">Symphony and I need a ride back to Santa</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.270" end="00:34:25.090" style="s2">Rosa California I can find I can query</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.020" end="00:34:26.649" style="s2">the crowd at the symphony and find out</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.090" end="00:34:29.560" style="s2">if there&#39;s anybody else that wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.649" end="00:34:31.090" style="s2">back to Santa Rosa and and as you said</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.560" end="00:34:35.290" style="s2">and then we could ride share together</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.090" end="00:34:36.909" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to find each other right I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.290" end="00:34:39.880" style="s2">envisioning more that it would be behind</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.909" end="00:34:41.050" style="s2">the scenes hey by the way Lisa we know</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.880" end="00:34:43.240" style="s2">that you have a neighbor going there</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.050" end="00:34:44.530" style="s2">would you be okay riding with them and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.240" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">you would say yes or no and they would</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.530" end="00:34:50.470" style="s2">say yes or no if you both said yes you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:53.740" style="s2">get matched up well they&#39;re actually our</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.470" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">places in San Francisco that our carpool</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.740" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">stops and you can go and stand at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:02.890" style="s2">carpool stop and see if anybody stops by</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:07.330" style="s2">who&#39;s going close to where you need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.890" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">go I haven&#39;t used one but it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.330" end="00:35:12.010" style="s2">I thought it was a good enough idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:15.190" style="s2">sorry for the sign which is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.010" end="00:35:16.540" style="s2">it sounds like hitchhiking right which</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.190" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2">is like illegal everywhere but like</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.540" end="00:35:20.860" style="s2">because it&#39;s car shared and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:22.330" style="s2">spot it&#39;s more there&#39;s a safety feature</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.860" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">to that but there&#39;s a safety we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.330" end="00:35:26.590" style="s2">build into an app more easily it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.460" end="00:35:29.080" style="s2">100% of course but something that could</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.590" end="00:35:30.970" style="s2">be how do I trust you whether you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.080" end="00:35:33.220" style="s2">driver or the passenger how do we share</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.970" end="00:35:34.119" style="s2">in gas how do I know that you might get</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.220" end="00:35:35.619" style="s2">me to point B</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.119" end="00:35:36.849" style="s2">I need to get to point C&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.619" end="00:35:39.640" style="s2">someone else going there afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.849" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">right and so being able to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.640" end="00:35:47.559" style="s2">basically hitchhiking along I in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.140" end="00:35:49.059" style="s2">our Greyhound our busses quit they no</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.559" end="00:35:50.200" style="s2">longer and not because the quantifiers</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.059" end="00:35:52.299" style="s2">they quit like over a year ago because</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.200" end="00:35:54.549" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t get little places and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.299" end="00:35:56.170" style="s2">only the big like out east is still</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.549" end="00:35:58.450" style="s2">where it&#39;s still operating between</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.170" end="00:35:59.859" style="s2">Toronto and Ottawa and Montreal but not</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.450" end="00:36:01.480" style="s2">out here I couldn&#39;t even make it home</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.859" end="00:36:03.130" style="s2">from here if the planes got grounded</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.480" end="00:36:04.329" style="s2">because there&#39;s no bus between I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.130" end="00:36:05.589" style="s2">there is actually about so there&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.329" end="00:36:08.019" style="s2">the Greyhound isn&#39;t the one that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.589" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">there but these these other ride-sharing</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.019" end="00:36:13.539" style="s2">apps could could take the place and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:16.420" style="s2">also in cities more like uber and lyft</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.539" end="00:36:16.990" style="s2">where we&#39;re also looking after I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.420" end="00:36:18.910" style="s2">know if we could do with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.990" end="00:36:21.640" style="s2">thousand dollars but finding mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.910" end="00:36:25.420" style="s2">who can service the vehicles at cost</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.640" end="00:36:27.670" style="s2">right so that there a lot of the money</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.420" end="00:36:29.470" style="s2">that uber drivers may go to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.670" end="00:36:31.059" style="s2">maintenance of their vehicles having gas</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.470" end="00:36:35.769" style="s2">be made more cheap maybe they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.059" end="00:36:37.630" style="s2">as many taxes because for ricard sharing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.769" end="00:36:38.710" style="s2">and to be those things but again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.630" end="00:36:40.690" style="s2">know if that&#39;s doable four hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.710" end="00:36:44.470" style="s2">thousand dollars so for 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.690" end="00:36:49.299" style="s2">and $100,000 car sharing and an app for</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.470" end="00:36:51.549" style="s2">car sharing you couldn&#39;t create well</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.299" end="00:36:56.890" style="s2">these are all experiments that can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.549" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">tried and there is there&#39;s a group</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.890" end="00:37:02.190" style="s2">called Code for America which actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">is a bunch of techies who are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.190" end="00:37:07.450" style="s2">write apps for free so you probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:10.509" style="s2">could do it for a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.450" end="00:37:13.239" style="s2">dollars we use Code for America a local</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.509" end="00:37:15.480" style="s2">Code for America group but there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.239" end="00:37:17.619" style="s2">awful lot that we could do if</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.480" end="00:37:20.559" style="s2">essentially we have a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.619" end="00:37:22.380" style="s2">leisure time we&#39;ve been spent the last</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.559" end="00:37:25.390" style="s2">five hundred years developing</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.380" end="00:37:27.640" style="s2">labor-saving devices and they do save a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.390" end="00:37:29.730" style="s2">lot of labor we don&#39;t have to scrub our</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.640" end="00:37:34.089" style="s2">front door suits anymore and we can just</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.730" end="00:37:36.369" style="s2">vacuum off and they&#39;re pretty clean you</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.089" end="00:37:39.660" style="s2">have huge amounts of leisure time but we</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.369" end="00:37:42.519" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out is how to share it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.660" end="00:37:43.989" style="s2">and so part of what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.519" end="00:37:45.609" style="s2">well ostensibly we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.989" end="00:37:48.280" style="s2">transportation we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.609" end="00:37:51.160" style="s2">sharing of transportation</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.280" end="00:37:54.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you get to do to service</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.160" end="00:38:04.360" style="s2">10,000 people for much less money than</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.100" end="00:38:06.670" style="s2">if you had to buy every piece of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.360" end="00:38:08.620" style="s2">funny you saying that uh hitchhiking is</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.670" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">illegal because that&#39;s like the standard</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.620" end="00:38:15.490" style="s2">in New Zealand that&#39;s this how everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:16.750" style="s2">gets around just perfect it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.490" end="00:38:18.430" style="s2">weird that it&#39;s illegal because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.750" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">there&#39;s much more unsafe things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:22.570" style="s2">been hitchhiking at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:25.570" style="s2">unsafe you don&#39;t know the person but a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.570" end="00:38:26.830" style="s2">lot of when we design apps together we</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.570" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">design technology together I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.830" end="00:38:32.440" style="s2">that&#39;s something we can discuss and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:34.330" style="s2">implement safety that isn&#39;t creepy right</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.440" end="00:38:35.530" style="s2">that isn&#39;t necessarily like ubers</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.330" end="00:38:37.810" style="s2">telling you whether you&#39;re a good person</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.530" end="00:38:39.640" style="s2">or not a good person and then you sue</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.810" end="00:38:41.770" style="s2">uber if the person&#39;s not good right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.640" end="00:38:43.630" style="s2">like how do I know that I&#39;m safe maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.770" end="00:38:44.890" style="s2">just could request female drivers and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.630" end="00:38:47.800" style="s2">only ride with people they&#39;re females</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.890" end="00:38:49.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit safer or someone who</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.800" end="00:38:52.300" style="s2">has a long track record but having that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.480" end="00:38:53.710" style="s2">that not peaceful into it which again</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.300" end="00:38:56.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t quite transportation but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.710" end="00:38:59.620" style="s2">needed for transportation well it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.230" end="00:39:02.410" style="s2">um from what a consequence of the change</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.620" end="00:39:05.380" style="s2">in transportation because I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.410" end="00:39:08.410" style="s2">three of us I&#39;m two generations older</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.380" end="00:39:10.420" style="s2">than you guys and hitchhiking was legal</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.410" end="00:39:14.340" style="s2">and was normal I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.420" end="00:39:18.370" style="s2">Massachusetts when I was a kid and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.340" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">everybody did it it was a much safer</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.370" end="00:39:22.600" style="s2">society however it was also a society</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:26.440" style="s2">where there was less transportation</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.600" end="00:39:27.910" style="s2">available and so not only was it harder</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.440" end="00:39:30.270" style="s2">for the good guys to get around it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.910" end="00:39:35.260" style="s2">harder for the bad guys to get around</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.270" end="00:39:37.630" style="s2">and again they were there there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.260" end="00:39:43.690" style="s2">positive and negatives to the increase</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.630" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">of transportation of people and our our</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.690" end="00:39:50.170" style="s2">ability to move around has in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:53.560" style="s2">made the boundaries of our individual</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.170" end="00:39:56.770" style="s2">communities so much more open and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.560" end="00:39:58.660" style="s2">flexible that we don&#39;t feel safe in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.770" end="00:40:00.730" style="s2">same way we don&#39;t protect each other I</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.660" end="00:40:01.799" style="s2">mean we never we didn&#39;t take the keys</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.730" end="00:40:04.209" style="s2">out of our car</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.799" end="00:40:07.299" style="s2">when I was a kid and we never locked the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.209" end="00:40:08.439" style="s2">door that was unheard of and your</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.299" end="00:40:12.130" style="s2">friends would walk in and say hello</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.439" end="00:40:18.159" style="s2">anybody there but the idea of locking</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.130" end="00:40:21.609" style="s2">the door was was strange so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.159" end="00:40:23.109" style="s2">if it&#39;s in a sense that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.609" end="00:40:26.229" style="s2">transportation and yet it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.109" end="00:40:30.279" style="s2">consequence a lot of the change in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.229" end="00:40:32.649" style="s2">transportation yeah absolutely I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.279" end="00:40:36.969" style="s2">one of the things we could do at 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.649" end="00:40:40.329" style="s2">people in $100,000 is map at least a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.969" end="00:40:43.779" style="s2">part of our supply chain is like where</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.329" end="00:40:45.909" style="s2">did this pen come from where did maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.779" end="00:40:47.469" style="s2">will never know that but if I can break</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.909" end="00:40:49.659" style="s2">down that there&#39;s aluminum in it what</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.469" end="00:40:50.949" style="s2">how much where is aluminum made in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.659" end="00:40:53.019" style="s2">world right maybe it doesn&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.949" end="00:40:55.029" style="s2">the aluminum in this pen came from but</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.019" end="00:40:57.219" style="s2">it can average all the aluminum that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.029" end="00:40:58.749" style="s2">made and where it was made and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.219" end="00:41:02.289" style="s2">the transportation for it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.749" end="00:41:04.569" style="s2">it&#39;s math plus data if we have it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.289" end="00:41:06.729" style="s2">then from there we can have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.569" end="00:41:10.689" style="s2">power in our supply chain we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.729" end="00:41:12.609" style="s2">fragility of it on the transportation of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.689" end="00:41:14.589" style="s2">good and we can see where well would it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.609" end="00:41:16.899" style="s2">make sense to produce pence locally</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.589" end="00:41:19.509" style="s2">there how much they probably wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.899" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">cheaper but what level would we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.509" end="00:41:22.989" style="s2">make them at for them to be cheaper they</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:25.149" style="s2">should be if it&#39;s not using a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.989" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">labor for them to be made locally versus</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.149" end="00:41:29.109" style="s2">made somewhere else and shipped here I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:32.529" style="s2">mentioned that daughter is out there</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.109" end="00:41:34.739" style="s2">already that&#39;s kind of goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.529" end="00:41:37.209" style="s2">you know how many slaves work for you</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.739" end="00:41:39.159" style="s2">because eventually those supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.209" end="00:41:43.419" style="s2">generally lead to you know horrible</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.159" end="00:41:45.579" style="s2">conditions but yeah it&#39;s an easier way</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.419" end="00:41:47.499" style="s2">to do things because I I think like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.579" end="00:41:52.569" style="s2">different materials cluster in different</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.499" end="00:41:54.819" style="s2">parts of the world unevenly well and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.569" end="00:41:57.069" style="s2">also if you if you make a commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.819" end="00:42:00.069" style="s2">local manufacturer you may also make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.069" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">commitment to changing the materials</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.069" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">that you&#39;re using so that you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:08.259" style="s2">local materials I mean we could use</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:10.630" style="s2">goose quills we&#39;ve got we got plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.259" end="00:42:17.130" style="s2">turkeys here and plenty of turkey</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.630" end="00:42:17.130" style="s2">feathers while turkeys are typically</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.570" end="00:42:21.830" style="s2">and there used to be a pencil factory</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.820" end="00:42:24.920" style="s2">right down the street it might be that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.830" end="00:42:27.530" style="s2">we would use pencils rather than or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.920" end="00:42:31.310" style="s2">pointing fence more if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.530" end="00:42:33.290" style="s2">commitment to local manufacture so it</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.310" end="00:42:35.870" style="s2">things are all connected together or not</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.290" end="00:42:37.640" style="s2">if you change one thing if you set up a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.870" end="00:42:41.410" style="s2">principle that says we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.640" end="00:42:45.590" style="s2">transport things as much things new</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.410" end="00:42:48.950" style="s2">technologies and new products made from</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.590" end="00:42:52.030" style="s2">different you know we&#39;ll eat more local</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.950" end="00:42:52.030" style="s2">eggs and chickens and less</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.390" end="00:43:00.650" style="s2">much of this changes if we start pricing</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.040" end="00:43:03.110" style="s2">at extra externalities because like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.650" end="00:43:05.690" style="s2">price of you know what someone should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.110" end="00:43:07.130" style="s2">making for whatever job that is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.690" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and then the cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.130" end="00:43:10.490" style="s2">transportation to get from you know one</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.230" style="s2">side of the world to the other like we</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.490" end="00:43:13.790" style="s2">should be pricing the stuff and so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.230" end="00:43:15.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to create the illusion</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.790" end="00:43:17.330" style="s2">that it&#39;s cheaper to make things</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.320" end="00:43:19.640" style="s2">elsewhere because that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.330" end="00:43:21.620" style="s2">the tout works in our current economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.640" end="00:43:23.900" style="s2">model but that&#39;s not how works in terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.620" end="00:43:25.160" style="s2">of like the price of you know destroying</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.900" end="00:43:27.290" style="s2">the environment or whatever it is or</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.160" end="00:43:29.570" style="s2">eroding communities or taking away</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.290" end="00:43:30.470" style="s2">opportunities with people and the local</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.570" end="00:43:33.080" style="s2">you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.470" end="00:43:34.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we could get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.080" end="00:43:36.440" style="s2">externalities but 10,000 people hundred</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.940" end="00:43:40.010" style="s2">thousand dollars it might be a great a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.440" end="00:43:42.230" style="s2">system that shows you the externalities</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.010" end="00:43:43.580" style="s2">right so although I paid two bucks for</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.230" end="00:43:46.460" style="s2">this pen it should have been twenty</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.580" end="00:43:49.880" style="s2">right and so I at least know that if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.460" end="00:43:51.530" style="s2">want to and look it up um and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.880" end="00:43:53.390" style="s2">knowing right that like okay you bought</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.530" end="00:43:55.310" style="s2">the eggs that were 50% less that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.390" end="00:43:58.010" style="s2">health care and the chickens life and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.310" end="00:43:59.750" style="s2">all this stuff on top of it is and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.010" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">can even see it broken down that might</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.750" end="00:44:03.380" style="s2">be something that we could do for</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:06.830" style="s2">$100,000 so that the 10,000 people have</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:08.780" style="s2">access to their top goods right there</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.830" end="00:44:10.280" style="s2">most of the food they buy most of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.780" end="00:44:11.240" style="s2">clothes they buy most the makeup and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.280" end="00:44:14.870" style="s2">household goods</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.240" end="00:44:15.530" style="s2">what is the externality or just how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.870" end="00:44:18.740" style="s2">we make it better</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.530" end="00:44:22.790" style="s2">Harry do you guys have go local</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.740" end="00:44:25.490" style="s2">initiatives in your communities we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.790" end="00:44:27.800" style="s2">in Sonoma County California there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.490" end="00:44:28.610" style="s2">think it&#39;s the supervisors I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.800" end="00:44:30.770" style="s2">who it is who</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.610" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">done it or the chambers of commerce have</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.770" end="00:44:38.330" style="s2">a whole campaign which is called go</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:41.780" style="s2">local and companies local companies</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.330" end="00:44:44.990" style="s2">advertised that this product was</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.780" end="00:44:49.340" style="s2">produced locally and many stores give a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.990" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">discount if you buy the local product so</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.340" end="00:44:54.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a combination of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:59.540" style="s2">economics of it and the kind of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.080" end="00:45:04.850" style="s2">of it and something to view the campaign</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.540" end="00:45:09.340" style="s2">but part of the goal local initiative is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.850" end="00:45:11.960" style="s2">to as you said bring bring to attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.340" end="00:45:16.670" style="s2">the travel the transportation costs of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.960" end="00:45:18.890" style="s2">the goods and the local by local it</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.670" end="00:45:20.930" style="s2">really addresses that now I suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.890" end="00:45:22.550" style="s2">more than ten thousand dollars was</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.930" end="00:45:24.410" style="s2">invested in it but it might not have</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.550" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">been more than ten thousand dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.410" end="00:45:32.540" style="s2">year yeah I mentioned like eighty</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:35.900" style="s2">thousand of that hundred thousand would</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.540" end="00:45:40.040" style="s2">just be advertising if what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.900" end="00:45:41.690" style="s2">is a campaign yes if your objective is</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.040" end="00:45:43.730" style="s2">to raise people&#39;s awareness and change</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.690" end="00:45:46.360" style="s2">their behavior because they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.730" end="00:45:49.240" style="s2">different information yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.360" end="00:45:51.770" style="s2">advertising or information dissemination</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.240" end="00:45:54.140" style="s2">yeah and then maybe this is like a bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.770" end="00:45:56.900" style="s2">of way to do things because if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.140" end="00:45:58.610" style="s2">started local communities maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.900" end="00:46:00.350" style="s2">focus of those local communities would</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.610" end="00:46:02.180" style="s2">be more unlike what is the system that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.350" end="00:46:03.860" style="s2">you&#39;re actually embedded in and like</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.180" end="00:46:05.900" style="s2">what are the things that are going a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.860" end="00:46:08.570" style="s2">around that are actually pushing things</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.900" end="00:46:10.220" style="s2">towards you know business solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.570" end="00:46:12.500" style="s2">better organization those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.220" end="00:46:13.700" style="s2">things so people don&#39;t have to spend</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.500" end="00:46:16.220" style="s2">crazy amounts of money on advertising</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.700" end="00:46:17.390" style="s2">and they&#39;re just you know people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.220" end="00:46:19.370" style="s2">just aware of it because it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:21.320" style="s2">the local community it&#39;s again it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.370" end="00:46:22.850" style="s2">of different but I think like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.320" end="00:46:26.840" style="s2">stuff I feel like we just need a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.850" end="00:46:28.370" style="s2">different approach on other levels like</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.840" end="00:46:30.380" style="s2">if we solve problems that are a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.370" end="00:46:32.990" style="s2">at a lower level then we can like these</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.380" end="00:46:35.810" style="s2">things just become easier to solve but</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.990" end="00:46:37.880" style="s2">yeah I think wonderful though again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.810" end="00:46:39.560" style="s2">not transportation itself but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.880" end="00:46:41.420" style="s2">transportation adjacent is picking an</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.560" end="00:46:42.440" style="s2">industry like clothing that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.420" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">definitely made of somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.440" end="00:46:46.130" style="s2">and the stuffs brought brought somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:49.369" style="s2">and made and then shipped of like how</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.130" end="00:46:51.290" style="s2">can we design clothing swaps to be more</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.369" end="00:46:53.780" style="s2">easy or shared closets so that if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.290" end="00:46:55.190" style="s2">going to a special events I can borrow</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.780" end="00:46:57.589" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s and you can exchange</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.190" end="00:46:59.750" style="s2">them or having a tool library even if</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.589" end="00:47:01.130" style="s2">you&#39;re not in a big city center anyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.750" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">and I know these things already exist</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.130" end="00:47:04.119" style="s2">but if they exist when we create them</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.619" style="s2">together they&#39;re much more useful um</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.119" end="00:47:08.270" style="s2">like you have a power drill I can borrow</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.619" end="00:47:10.040" style="s2">as opposing to it needing to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.270" end="00:47:11.420" style="s2">central database that I can borrow it</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.040" end="00:47:12.950" style="s2">from then I can just borrow it directly</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.420" end="00:47:15.829" style="s2">from you and it helps us figure out</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.950" end="00:47:17.900" style="s2">where the stuff is so that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.829" end="00:47:19.339" style="s2">need to be transported but it could</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.900" end="00:47:21.560" style="s2">maybe be transported with the hub light</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.339" end="00:47:24.500" style="s2">I think the hub could be set up in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.560" end="00:47:27.740" style="s2">city for a hundred thousand dollars by</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.500" end="00:47:30.099" style="s2">finding a bunch of local businesses that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.740" end="00:47:33.349" style="s2">do want their goods to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.099" end="00:47:36.829" style="s2">delivered and already have them under</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.349" end="00:47:38.270" style="s2">the regulations and then figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.829" end="00:47:40.339" style="s2">how do we work together to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.270" end="00:47:41.900" style="s2">your customer first cheap as possible as</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.339" end="00:47:43.430" style="s2">ethically as possible and then other</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.900" end="00:47:46.849" style="s2">people can come on board as they have</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.430" end="00:47:48.200" style="s2">goods and services and have one one hub</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.849" end="00:47:49.069" style="s2">location it probably couldn&#39;t be served</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.200" end="00:47:51.170" style="s2">for hundred thousand dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.069" end="00:47:54.410" style="s2">Vancouver but a more rural place it</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.170" end="00:47:59.410" style="s2">could be less expensive places need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.410" end="00:48:06.520" style="s2">grow so is there a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.410" end="00:48:10.460" style="s2">that and setting up a a barter system</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.520" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">and in a sense a barter system if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.460" end="00:48:16.520" style="s2">set up a barter exchange platform and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.150" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">give everybody mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.520" end="00:48:22.460" style="s2">five hundred or a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:25.130" style="s2">credit to prime that pump and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.460" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">everybody lists the services that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.130" end="00:48:32.869" style="s2">have to offer or the products they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:35.540" style="s2">to offer and then you just press the Go</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.869" end="00:48:38.390" style="s2">button and let it let it run I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.540" end="00:48:43.609" style="s2">we can certainly do with $100,000 you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.390" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">could probably do that with $10,000 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.609" end="00:48:49.190" style="s2">I mean that a shirt is different than</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:52.069" style="s2">the barter system but that also sounds</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.190" end="00:48:56.090" style="s2">like a viable a very amazing option to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.069" end="00:48:58.430" style="s2">have on the table or creating am</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.090" end="00:48:59.960" style="s2">a barter of goods and services that then</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:02.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to transport you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.960" end="00:49:04.250" style="s2">having all of the bureaucracy involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.030" end="00:49:09.410" style="s2">in everything everything you do together</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.250" end="00:49:10.730" style="s2">or listen to say socially I think just</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.410" end="00:49:12.110" style="s2">doing it for free right like I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.730" end="00:49:13.670" style="s2">about the cookies like here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.110" end="00:49:15.110" style="s2">here&#39;s what I&#39;m giving and I&#39;m giving it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.670" end="00:49:15.560" style="s2">to the to the world who needs it the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.110" end="00:49:17.810" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.560" end="00:49:20.270" style="s2">and having multiple options people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.810" end="00:49:22.010" style="s2">need to make money and people who see</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.270" end="00:49:28.280" style="s2">which one which one plays out which one</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.010" end="00:49:29.510" style="s2">calls the most people in suppose you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.280" end="00:49:31.310" style="s2">could have also have an app where you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.510" end="00:49:33.350" style="s2">look like so someone&#39;s at their house</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.310" end="00:49:34.910" style="s2">and they&#39;re like I need a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.350" end="00:49:36.590" style="s2">toast or something like that and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.910" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">creates another thing and they seemed</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.590" end="00:49:40.280" style="s2">out of thinking sort of like how the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:42.860" style="s2">rideshare apps work and then if</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.280" end="00:49:44.990" style="s2">someone&#39;s traveling you know pass them</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.860" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">at some point that could be like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.990" end="00:49:47.780" style="s2">don&#39;t know am I using my toaster at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:50.630" style="s2">moment I&#39;m going to be leaving in five</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.780" end="00:49:51.950" style="s2">minutes so you can like yeah I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.630" end="00:49:52.970" style="s2">problem with that is just the attention</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.950" end="00:49:54.680" style="s2">economy because you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.970" end="00:49:56.270" style="s2">somehow get people&#39;s attention people</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.680" end="00:50:01.640" style="s2">gonna have to put this thing on and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.270" end="00:50:04.190" style="s2">what series do that probably none there</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.640" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">was this um Facebook group called mums</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.190" end="00:50:07.640" style="s2">to moms that I was part of and it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:08.930" style="s2">like you&#39;d put something up for free it</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.640" end="00:50:10.460" style="s2">was always for free you&#39;d be like I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.930" end="00:50:12.080" style="s2">a guitar and then there&#39;d be a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.460" end="00:50:13.550" style="s2">people and if you could have a either</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.080" end="00:50:17.420" style="s2">first come first serve you could do like</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.550" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">a lottery system and I was disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.420" end="00:50:20.660" style="s2">because I gave my guitar to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:22.280" style="s2">later on it was like wait I actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.660" end="00:50:24.230" style="s2">want my guitar and it could end so</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.280" end="00:50:26.600" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to say what you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.230" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">and if it was something that came up</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.600" end="00:50:30.050" style="s2">then you were the first to get it and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:31.940" style="s2">was the only thing I put I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.050" end="00:50:33.230" style="s2">want a guitar and someone came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.940" end="00:50:35.060" style="s2">guitar and they were like oh Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.230" end="00:50:37.300" style="s2">wants a guitar they were like no no you</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.060" end="00:50:40.100" style="s2">can&#39;t want a guitar it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.300" end="00:50:42.260" style="s2">needed item so we&#39;re gonna auction it it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.100" end="00:50:44.210" style="s2">was like that&#39;s not and so having</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.260" end="00:50:45.980" style="s2">something like that system but when you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.210" end="00:50:47.570" style="s2">gave something you were just as likely</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.980" end="00:50:49.700" style="s2">to get that same thing back so I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.570" end="00:50:51.170" style="s2">need to hold on to it right like if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.700" end="00:50:53.330" style="s2">gave you the guitar I would get a guitar</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.170" end="00:50:55.130" style="s2">later if I wanted one and then you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.330" end="00:50:57.230" style="s2">more willing to give it up right be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.130" end="00:51:00.260" style="s2">if I want this book back honestly this</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.230" end="00:51:01.670" style="s2">one like any one of that book then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.260" end="00:51:03.350" style="s2">get it if I want it so I can be more</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.670" end="00:51:05.690" style="s2">willing to give it out submit its lens</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.350" end="00:51:08.420" style="s2">everywhere and it just it just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.690" end="00:51:09.940" style="s2">what I&#39;ve given into the system so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.420" end="00:51:11.980" style="s2">I again</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.940" end="00:51:14.380" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t get a guitar back is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.980" end="00:51:19.450" style="s2">difference between a donating system and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.380" end="00:51:21.339" style="s2">a lending system if you if if they</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.450" end="00:51:24.040" style="s2">wanted a guitar and somebody and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.339" end="00:51:26.200" style="s2">could lend your guitar then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.040" end="00:51:29.109" style="s2">recipient could keep it until you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.200" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">it back and then I had it back but it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.109" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">work it&#39;s working system you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">it back yeah yeah so you could start it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:38.200" style="s2">you could set up the platform so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:42.910" style="s2">you could specify whether it was a loan</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.200" end="00:51:46.839" style="s2">or a donation it&#39;s just another bit in</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.910" end="00:51:49.079" style="s2">the database yeah with with a toaster</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.839" end="00:51:52.420" style="s2">there&#39;s some issue because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.079" end="00:51:54.069" style="s2">there&#39;s a hygiene issue around whether</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.420" end="00:52:00.180" style="s2">you get your toaster back clean or</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.069" end="00:52:02.380" style="s2">filled with somebody else&#39;s crumbs so in</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.180" end="00:52:03.940" style="s2">current lending like lending tool</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.380" end="00:52:06.660" style="s2">lending library kinds of things often</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.940" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">you have to put a cleaning deposit down</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.660" end="00:52:14.140" style="s2">so that if you don&#39;t give it back clean</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.940" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">it can be somebody gets paid yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.140" end="00:52:17.740" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the little hurdle that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:21.400" style="s2">could be solved as compared with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.740" end="00:52:23.260" style="s2">basic idea yeah plus things cuz I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.400" end="00:52:24.310" style="s2">the cleanest person so like I want</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.260" end="00:52:25.750" style="s2">someone to know that when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.310" end="00:52:27.069" style="s2">lending me something and I will try I</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.750" end="00:52:28.780" style="s2">will clean it but it probably won&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.069" end="00:52:31.150" style="s2">back pristine there&#39;s other people I</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.780" end="00:52:32.859" style="s2">know don&#39;t probably come back better</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.150" end="00:52:34.420" style="s2">than you lent it to them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.859" end="00:52:37.089" style="s2">just the kind of people who know how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.420" end="00:52:38.740" style="s2">get every mark off of stuff but having</p>

<p begin="00:52:38.740" end="00:52:40.900" style="s2">going to give it to me so I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.730" end="00:52:43.270" style="s2">gonna look after to the best of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.900" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">ability or if you have a cat or a dog</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.270" end="00:52:46.839" style="s2">and then you&#39;re allergic maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:49.030" style="s2">lend it to somebody with that just</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.839" end="00:52:50.980" style="s2">having more information in the systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.030" end="00:52:54.010" style="s2">you can be more focused on it and if</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.980" end="00:52:55.900" style="s2">everything I borrow breaks you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.010" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">maybe I stop borrowing stuff but you see</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.900" end="00:53:01.540" style="s2">who is the person who doesn&#39;t clean</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">stuff or break stuff and and maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.540" end="00:53:06.930" style="s2">you know to know the risk associated</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:10.780" style="s2">with lending a specific person something</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.930" end="00:53:12.430" style="s2">yeah well the thing is the more the more</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.780" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">bad actors there are in a system the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.430" end="00:53:18.910" style="s2">least likely to continue to use them so</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:20.589" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s like I&#39;m not a bad like</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.910" end="00:53:23.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a bad actor but like</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.589" end="00:53:25.089" style="s2">if you just have that information right</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.410" end="00:53:26.770" style="s2">like okay you you are gonna forget you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.089" end="00:53:29.020" style="s2">haven&#39;t forget to give it back right</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.770" end="00:53:31.180" style="s2">like we&#39;re all different you Minh beings</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.020" end="00:53:33.490" style="s2">with our own failings so just knowing if</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.180" end="00:53:35.049" style="s2">this is the height because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.490" end="00:53:37.059" style="s2">can&#39;t be perfect in fact nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.049" end="00:53:38.890" style="s2">perfect so we all probably have things</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.059" end="00:53:40.900" style="s2">that we don&#39;t do but knowing what thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.890" end="00:53:43.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t do that it&#39;s going to annoy me</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:44.710" style="s2">at the highest level so I don&#39;t gift it</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.000" end="00:53:46.569" style="s2">to like I don&#39;t lend it to that person</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.710" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">maybe I only gift it to that person</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.569" end="00:53:50.470" style="s2">right so that I know it&#39;s okay I&#39;m never</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:53.559" style="s2">gonna get it back it&#39;s never gonna be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.470" end="00:53:55.270" style="s2">that stage it&#39;s like friends I have who</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.559" end="00:53:56.770" style="s2">I know are late all the time but I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.270" end="00:53:59.619" style="s2">they&#39;re late all the time so I&#39;d give</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.770" end="00:54:01.690" style="s2">that that extra that extra time and send</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.619" end="00:54:02.849" style="s2">it back half an hour well they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.690" end="00:54:07.630" style="s2">think they&#39;re bad people</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.849" end="00:54:10.210" style="s2">as as these platforms get designed we</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.630" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">have to it&#39;s an iterative process where</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.210" end="00:54:16.539" style="s2">you design it and you try it out and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:18.430" style="s2">this problem comes up we can anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.539" end="00:54:20.289" style="s2">a couple of the problems but we probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.430" end="00:54:24.220" style="s2">can&#39;t anticipate them all we have to try</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.289" end="00:54:26.500" style="s2">it out and part of I think being</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.220" end="00:54:29.619" style="s2">successful is a matter of being flexible</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.500" end="00:54:31.750" style="s2">and whether it&#39;s we just we just in</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.619" end="00:54:35.230" style="s2">Sonoma County California started the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.750" end="00:54:37.960" style="s2">smart train which is a light rail that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.230" end="00:54:42.130" style="s2">goes doesn&#39;t go all the way to San</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.960" end="00:54:43.779" style="s2">Francisco but it goes close and some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.130" end="00:54:46.599" style="s2">the some of the features that were</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.779" end="00:54:51.700" style="s2">implemented were successful and some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.599" end="00:54:53.260" style="s2">them are not and there there was just in</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.700" end="00:54:56.049" style="s2">the primary we just had to vote on</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.260" end="00:54:57.819" style="s2">whether to continue to fund the smart</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.049" end="00:55:00.730" style="s2">train and a lot of people were saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.819" end="00:55:03.869" style="s2">well it didn&#39;t meet their expectations</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.730" end="00:55:06.369" style="s2">so therefore we shouldn&#39;t keep it going</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.869" end="00:55:08.910" style="s2">and other people are saying hey this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.369" end="00:55:11.410" style="s2">a continuous approved but projects and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.910" end="00:55:15.940" style="s2">we need to keep funding it and it will</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.410" end="00:55:17.950" style="s2">get better so thinking that the our</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.940" end="00:55:19.390" style="s2">first answer is the definitive answer in</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.950" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">anything but trans certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.390" end="00:55:26.279" style="s2">transportation is probably not going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:29.710" style="s2">evolve a very successful transfer</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.279" end="00:55:32.740" style="s2">transportation system over time or board</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.710" end="00:55:34.359" style="s2">of sight more linda&#39;s and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.740" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">an important part of anything we create</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.359" end="00:55:37.240" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t need to be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:39.670" style="s2">it&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.240" end="00:55:44.440" style="s2">somewhere and then it it improves and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.670" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">gets better as you have more people I</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.440" end="00:55:48.100" style="s2">mean the idea also have been 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:49.630" style="s2">people creating a solution is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.100" end="00:55:51.070" style="s2">hopefully they have some ownership over</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.630" end="00:55:53.080" style="s2">that solutions they&#39;re more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.070" end="00:55:55.150" style="s2">accept slightly subpar and they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.080" end="00:55:57.250" style="s2">likely to give their contribution both</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.150" end="00:55:59.620" style="s2">idea and financial to help improve it</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.250" end="00:56:01.870" style="s2">because they feel ownership over it so</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.620" end="00:56:03.930" style="s2">that is very much in alignment with I</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.870" end="00:56:08.050" style="s2">think anything we create together is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.930" end="00:56:09.730" style="s2">what&#39;s the easiest thing or the simplest</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.050" end="00:56:10.900" style="s2">or the the best the thing that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.730" end="00:56:13.150" style="s2">have the most impact for the least</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.900" end="00:56:15.250" style="s2">amount of money to be created and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.150" end="00:56:17.770" style="s2">how do we look for what&#39;s going wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.250" end="00:56:24.550" style="s2">and continually improve it for their</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.770" end="00:56:25.570" style="s2">maximum benefit does anyone have</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.550" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">anything else they would like to add</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.570" end="00:56:31.600" style="s2">we&#39;re getting up to the hour so I can</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:37.600" style="s2">give our closing statements nothing it</p>
