<p begin="00:00:05.549" end="00:00:12.690" style="s2">by the internet and online communities</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.760" end="00:00:15.470" style="s2">and so that is this video because it</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.690" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">inspires my mission in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.470" end="00:00:22.670" style="s2">Craigslist has been responsible for my</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:27.480" style="s2">last serious relationship a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.670" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">less like more minor relationships a few</p>

<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">through it would not through Craigslist</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:53.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a lot of roommates I have met</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">nearly all of them through Craigslist</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.870" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">when I was given the capacity to be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">one to find my roommate how can be more</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">compatible rather than them going</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:08.310" style="s2">through my landlord and they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">I mean who you live with changes in your</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.310" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">life no matter whether it&#39;s a good or</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:12.840" style="s2">bad experience and I&#39;ve left out that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">almost all of those many very good</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.840" end="00:01:20.030" style="s2">experiences and a handful of them have</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:20.030" style="s2">become lifelong friends I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">so Craigslist is one one thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">greatly changed my life the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">is Facebook groups when I became a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">parent and I wasn&#39;t really able to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">out of the house as much with both a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">newborn and I&#39;ll suggest my health</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.240" style="s2">challenges in realizing that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">deal with the sensory input of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">outside world my world became very</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">insular and as someone who needed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">like run to everything by someone else</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">so I could kind of gauge it with my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">inner filter sound understand that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">what I was doing I had these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">parenting groups that I was part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.659" style="s2">every single one of my health challenges</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">has a Facebook group so when I need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">get advice on that specific thing or if</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">I have a new thing that arises like</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">which one does it fall under wait let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">ask the single side of deaf community</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.569" end="00:02:19.359" style="s2">I got kicked out of that one for</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.909" end="00:02:23.560" style="s2">questioning the supreme leader um I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.359" end="00:02:25.150" style="s2">just so grateful for the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.560" end="00:02:27.189" style="s2">what it&#39;s brought to my life and these</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.150" end="00:02:28.870" style="s2">especially Craigslist and the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.189" end="00:02:29.980" style="s2">groups now there&#39;s game B in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.870" end="00:02:32.290" style="s2">Facebook group and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.980" end="00:02:33.939" style="s2">met half the people I have met if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.290" end="00:02:36.849" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been for for that group because</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.939" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">the the Twitter game B thing just</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.849" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for from my brain but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.700" end="00:02:45.219" style="s2">groups like I&#39;ve seen people step up and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:47.560" style="s2">be there for people they have never met</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.219" end="00:02:49.180" style="s2">before they&#39;ve had conversations in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.560" end="00:02:50.980" style="s2">Facebook group but then someone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.180" end="00:02:52.329" style="s2">have somebody to like watch their kid</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.980" end="00:02:57.609" style="s2">for a week while they&#39;re in the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.329" end="00:02:59.709" style="s2">and people step up and help them one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.609" end="00:03:02.829" style="s2">the mothers was dying of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.709" end="00:03:04.209" style="s2">it&#39;s now passed away and the amount that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.829" end="00:03:05.859" style="s2">the community stepped up and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.209" end="00:03:08.590" style="s2">integral part of the community that she</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.859" end="00:03:11.500" style="s2">was to watch people you know gather</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.590" end="00:03:13.329" style="s2">around finding like answers to questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.500" end="00:03:14.680" style="s2">what is this toy where can I find this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.329" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">toy because it&#39;s my kids favorite and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.680" end="00:03:21.459" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:24.639" style="s2">crowdfunding and crowdsourcing and just</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.459" end="00:03:28.540" style="s2">made me see the people when given the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.639" end="00:03:32.019" style="s2">option are good we want to help each</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.540" end="00:03:37.449" style="s2">other we want to do kindness and even</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.019" end="00:03:38.919" style="s2">one of the groups kind of was this a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.449" end="00:03:41.199" style="s2">for people to help each other who were</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.919" end="00:03:43.569" style="s2">who were under the poverty line like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.199" end="00:03:46.180" style="s2">could request groceries you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.569" end="00:03:47.470" style="s2">request certain items and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">bit of a scandal in there that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.470" end="00:03:50.439" style="s2">people who ran it were like taking more</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:53.079" style="s2">money and doing the stuff but even in</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.439" end="00:03:55.239" style="s2">that even in the like not-so-great part</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.079" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">of humanity there was still right the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.239" end="00:03:58.930" style="s2">reason they were able to do that was by</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">tapping into all the goodness of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.930" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">everyone else so let&#39;s not discount the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:05.199" style="s2">goodness of everyone else just because</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:07.780" style="s2">somebody skewed it to their own best</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.199" end="00:04:11.739" style="s2">interest because we can have both we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.780" end="00:04:15.879" style="s2">do both we can create systems that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.739" end="00:04:19.060" style="s2">aren&#39;t as easy to manipulate and still</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.879" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">tap into the goodness of humanity and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.060" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">so doing I can see all the ways that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.139" style="s2">Internet is powerful and can connect us</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:28.810" style="s2">and enhance</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.139" end="00:04:31.090" style="s2">our good nature and how it can do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.810" end="00:04:33.699" style="s2">opposite and I have now figured out how</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.090" end="00:04:36.729" style="s2">we can have it do much more of the good</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.699" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">with much less of the bad and a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.729" end="00:04:42.939" style="s2">piece of that was seeing the blessings</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:45.069" style="s2">that both Craigslist and these Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.939" end="00:04:47.669" style="s2">groups had on my life and the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.069" end="00:04:47.669" style="s2">people around me</p>
