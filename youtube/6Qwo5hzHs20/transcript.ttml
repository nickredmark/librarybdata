<p begin="00:00:10.830" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">first attempt at trying to create some</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:20.789" style="s2">kind of video diary it probably be</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">sporadic and no on a regular basis but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.789" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">thought I&#39;d share how the visit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">Professor Anthony Capone then went he is</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:36.660" style="s2">the world&#39;s first professor for</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:42.110" style="s2">planetary health based at the University</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.660" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">of Sydney and he&#39;s also a co-author of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.110" end="00:00:53.550" style="s2">recent report that was created by The</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">Lancet Commission and the Rockefeller</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">Foundation on planetary health and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">it means to safeguard planetary health</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">in the Anthropocene so while I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">keen on the the wording of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:16.220" style="s2">Anthropocene but that&#39;s a whole nother</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">story was real surprised to me in a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.220" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2">about four five weeks ago he contacted</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">me told me that he was in Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">that between a conference in Bali with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">future Earth in a number of meetings in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">London and in Cambridge he had some time</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">and he wondered whether it would fit my</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">schedule for him to come down to Majorca</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">so we could have a conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">was really quite surprised and flattered</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">that he would take that time out to come</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">and see me and what transpired in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:54.260" style="s2">conversations that while he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:57.170" style="s2">working with this group of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.260" end="00:02:00.830" style="s2">ecological epidemiology technologists</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.170" end="00:02:04.700" style="s2">and mainly medics with some system</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.830" end="00:02:09.140" style="s2">scientists on developing this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.700" end="00:02:13.240" style="s2">planetary health he found himself to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.140" end="00:02:16.910" style="s2">one of the most realistic and widely</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.240" end="00:02:19.700" style="s2">thinking people in that group and when</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.910" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">he did some research on the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.700" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">the planet planetary health concept he</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:27.710" style="s2">came across some of the papers that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:32.540" style="s2">wrote while I was doing my PhD research</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.710" end="00:02:35.140" style="s2">between 2004 and 2006 and some papers</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.540" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">that I wrote in 2006 just after I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.140" end="00:02:42.370" style="s2">published my PhD my PhD was on design</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:45.380" style="s2">for human and Planetary health a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.370" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">holistic integral approach to complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.380" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">and sustainability and because it was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:55.820" style="s2">a design school I could break a number</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">of established boundaries for PhD work</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.820" end="00:03:01.610" style="s2">because at the time PhDs and design was</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:05.690" style="s2">still relatively new and I had come in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.610" end="00:03:08.620" style="s2">on a scholarship from like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.690" end="00:03:11.810" style="s2">scholarships by the faculty I was at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.620" end="00:03:13.600" style="s2">Jordan School of Art and Design the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.810" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">Center for the study of natural design</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.600" end="00:03:20.150" style="s2">which is run by my mentor and my PhD</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:23.090" style="s2">supervisor professor Stephen Baxter who</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.150" end="00:03:26.440" style="s2">I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:30.910" style="s2">and basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.440" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">in that work I sketched out what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.910" end="00:03:35.020" style="s2">might mean to design for human and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">Planetary health and I used my</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.020" end="00:03:38.530" style="s2">background in complexity theory in Earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:41.230" style="s2">System science what I learned at</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.530" end="00:03:46.240" style="s2">Schumacher College in the master&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.230" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">holistic science to advance a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.240" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">how health is really an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">property in complex dynamic systems and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.890" style="s2">it emerges through the interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:03.310" style="s2">relationships of all the agents in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.890" end="00:04:05.620" style="s2">system and emerges at different scales</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.310" end="00:04:08.680" style="s2">that are interconnected so I use this</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.620" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">idea of scale linking how the local is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.680" end="00:04:14.730" style="s2">ring linked to the regional to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:20.410" style="s2">bioregional to the local ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">the global and how health really depends</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.410" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.070" end="00:04:29.010" style="s2">right relationships and healthy dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:32.610" style="s2">that it allowed the health of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:35.070" style="s2">to express itself because ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.610" end="00:04:37.890" style="s2">whole has a healthy dynamic as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.070" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">evolves but of course everybody who</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.890" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">participates like each one of us and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:47.130" style="s2">whole of humanity influence the health</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:53.000" style="s2">of the whole and so yeah this notion</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.130" end="00:04:55.980" style="s2">that individual health community health</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.000" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">bio regional ecosystems health and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.980" end="00:05:01.050" style="s2">Planetary health are intimately linked</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">and that ultimately health is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.050" end="00:05:08.010" style="s2">pattern that connects and is a scaling</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">pattern has strongly influenced Anthony</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.010" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">Capone&#39;s thinking and through him also</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">to some extent that new Commission on</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:21.060" style="s2">planetary health and so for me that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:24.090" style="s2">real exciting used to find out I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.060" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">aware of the report but to be contacted</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.090" end="00:05:30.750" style="s2">by one of its principles and to be told</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:33.780" style="s2">that this PhD research that I did more</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.750" end="00:05:37.200" style="s2">than 10 years ago actually had made a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.780" end="00:05:40.890" style="s2">difference to them is giving me an</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.200" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">enormous gratification and joy and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.890" end="00:05:48.510" style="s2">also I feel like all that hard work has</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:51.210" style="s2">not been in vain and maybe I was just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.510" end="00:05:53.100" style="s2">little bit ahead of my time because at</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.210" end="00:05:55.380" style="s2">the time when I tried to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.100" end="00:05:57.030" style="s2">postdoctoral research funding I had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.380" end="00:05:59.100" style="s2">brief postdoctoral fellowship from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.030" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">University of Dundee and I just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.100" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">get any funding being in a design school</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">when I wrote to the Arts and Humanities</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:08.690" style="s2">Research Council they said this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.060" end="00:06:11.630" style="s2">terribly scientific it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.690" end="00:06:13.770" style="s2">ecosystems restoration and about</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.630" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">renewable energy and sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.770" end="00:06:18.090" style="s2">transport sustainable cities sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">product design but from a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:22.570" style="s2">scientific perspective dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.430" end="00:06:24.430" style="s2">climate change and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.570" end="00:06:25.750" style="s2">well at the time it they weren&#39;t called</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:27.160" style="s2">planetary boundaries but basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.750" end="00:06:30.130" style="s2">dealing with the planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.160" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">and and so they said why don&#39;t you talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.130" end="00:06:35.800" style="s2">to the art said the environmental and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:37.630" style="s2">physical science Research Council they</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.800" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">might fund something like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.630" end="00:06:40.900" style="s2">when I did that they would then come</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.760" end="00:06:42.310" style="s2">back to me and say but you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.900" end="00:06:44.680" style="s2">design school what are you talking to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.310" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">for and when I wrote to both of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.680" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">copying him into the replies that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:51.850" style="s2">gotten from me they basically said why</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:54.070" style="s2">don&#39;t you go and talk to the Social</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.850" end="00:06:56.110" style="s2">Science Research Council because you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.070" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">don&#39;t fit here or maybe even the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.110" end="00:07:02.740" style="s2">Economic Research Council might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:05.470" style="s2">willing to take this on long story short</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.740" end="00:07:08.020" style="s2">I back then just couldn&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.470" end="00:07:10.390" style="s2">funding in conventional macademia they</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.020" end="00:07:12.280" style="s2">were talking about interdisciplinarity</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.390" end="00:07:14.170" style="s2">and transdisciplinarity but they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.280" end="00:07:17.890" style="s2">just not ready for it and these big</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.170" end="00:07:21.250" style="s2">questions were just something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.890" end="00:07:24.550" style="s2">nobody wanted to fund so in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.250" end="00:07:26.380" style="s2">was a kind invitation to doing what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.550" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">done in the 12 years since which is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.380" end="00:07:35.170" style="s2">dance on the edge between more</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:38.310" style="s2">pioneering educational NGOs and projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.170" end="00:07:40.630" style="s2">that are practically on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.310" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2">experimenting with how we might create a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.630" end="00:07:47.530" style="s2">more sustainable and thriving future and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.500" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">occasionally link them into work with</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.530" end="00:07:54.190" style="s2">universities and with local and national</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:08:00.470" style="s2">government and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.190" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">to find now that there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.470" end="00:08:05.300" style="s2">momentum that there&#39;s now a professor</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.020" end="00:08:07.759" style="s2">for planetary health in it that already</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.300" end="00:08:09.949" style="s2">Harvard has now created another chair</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:11.180" style="s2">that also has the word planetary health</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.949" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">and the title it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.180" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">environmental restoration and planetary</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">health and Anthony came on Thursday</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">picked him up from the airport we had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:27.949" style="s2">nice conversation in the afternoon and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:30.460" style="s2">walked by therefore by the sea and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.949" end="00:08:34.579" style="s2">we spent the whole of Friday really</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.460" end="00:08:36.289" style="s2">talking in a very wide-ranging wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.579" end="00:08:38.510" style="s2">conversation about how we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.289" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">collaborate and how he sees that field</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.510" end="00:08:45.620" style="s2">evolving and then I also saw him again</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:48.730" style="s2">on Saturday evening for just a final</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.620" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">check before he left on on Sunday and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.730" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">initially we intended to record part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:56.060" style="s2">our conversation on Saturday but in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.579" style="s2">end it was such a nice evening and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.060" end="00:09:01.970" style="s2">were sitting watching the sunset and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.579" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">just got talking and decided that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.970" end="00:09:09.050" style="s2">could always do the recording on his own</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:13.209" style="s2">call and so watch that space so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.050" end="00:09:17.630" style="s2">talked about a huge range of topics but</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.209" end="00:09:20.149" style="s2">what we both agreed on is that even</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.630" end="00:09:22.459" style="s2">within this budding movement of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.149" end="00:09:27.740" style="s2">planetary health there&#39;s still a need</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.459" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">for a much more holistic approach and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.740" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">said what he liked about my work is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:37.190" style="s2">it focused on change it focused on how</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.790" end="00:09:40.220" style="s2">can we actually make an influence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.190" end="00:09:44.990" style="s2">become planetary healers how can we work</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.220" end="00:09:47.060" style="s2">on restoration and regeneration and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.990" end="00:09:50.149" style="s2">even brought a copy of my book asking me</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.060" end="00:09:53.640" style="s2">to sign it and and complimented me on on</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.149" end="00:09:56.260" style="s2">that work and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.640" end="00:09:58.300" style="s2">basically he said that not everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.260" end="00:10:00.970" style="s2">that community is aware of my work but</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.300" end="00:10:03.340" style="s2">he would like to help them find out</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.970" end="00:10:05.710" style="s2">about it because it has this very</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.340" end="00:10:10.150" style="s2">holistic approach and then he showed me</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.710" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">a graphic that shows how he now in his</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.150" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">talks Peale who conceives and introduces</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">planetary health and it is very much</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:22.420" style="s2">linked to what I was calling scale</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.370" end="00:10:25.390" style="s2">linking issues in my PhD how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.420" end="00:10:29.560" style="s2">people how do we house people how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.390" end="00:10:34.930" style="s2">feed people how do we provide energy for</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:39.340" style="s2">people and how do we fit into this world</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:44.910" style="s2">how do we heal the health dynamics at</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.340" end="00:10:48.130" style="s2">ecosystems and planetary levels and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.910" end="00:10:51.130" style="s2">in talking about the sea also absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.130" end="00:10:53.830" style="s2">agreed on the necessity for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.130" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">bioregional approach that that while we</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.830" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">definitely need to work local in all</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:01.900" style="s2">localities everywhere and that saluto</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">genic health generating regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.900" end="00:11:06.930" style="s2">design has to be carefully adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:12.570" style="s2">the bio cultural uniqueness of place is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.930" end="00:11:16.030" style="s2">abroad with that he also agrees that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.570" end="00:11:19.240" style="s2">these local initiatives have to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.030" end="00:11:22.330" style="s2">aware of the nested holds they sit in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.240" end="00:11:24.730" style="s2">and the next wider hole the bio region</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.330" end="00:11:28.330" style="s2">is critically important his own work is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.730" end="00:11:30.400" style="s2">in mainly in city health and of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.330" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">cities sit within a particular bio</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.400" end="00:11:33.820" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.280" style="s2">so you could say local community cities</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.820" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">by a region if you if you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.280" end="00:11:42.070" style="s2">more granular in this scale inking</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:45.790" style="s2">approach but then we also agreed that to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.070" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">some extent the the national scale isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.790" end="00:11:51.970" style="s2">really something that has a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:55.450" style="s2">biological precedence it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.970" end="00:11:58.600" style="s2">completely socially constructed concept</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.450" end="00:12:00.400" style="s2">to say this is where the line you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.600" end="00:12:03.280" style="s2">see it when you look at the maps like so</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.400" end="00:12:06.670" style="s2">many particularly in in the former</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.280" end="00:12:11.709" style="s2">colonies so many borders have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.670" end="00:12:13.540" style="s2">drawn by the people in power with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.709" end="00:12:17.350" style="s2">ruler and their straight lines and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.540" end="00:12:19.180" style="s2">that&#39;s not how the biomes and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.350" end="00:12:23.560" style="s2">ecosystems that they these straight</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.180" end="00:12:25.589" style="s2">lines cross actually function so we we</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.560" end="00:12:28.269" style="s2">both agreed that as we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.589" end="00:12:30.519" style="s2">seventh generation thinking in deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.269" end="00:12:34.660" style="s2">transformations of the human presence on</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.519" end="00:12:38.709" style="s2">earth what we should hold in mind is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:42.120" style="s2">that national boundaries are an</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.709" end="00:12:46.600" style="s2">anachronism that we might well find that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.120" end="00:12:51.100" style="s2">won&#39;t be part of the future in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.600" end="00:12:56.140" style="s2">humanity has learned to act as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">planetary healer and appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.140" end="00:13:01.720" style="s2">participant in the emergence of health</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">at all scales within the planetary</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.720" end="00:13:08.620" style="s2">system and I thought that was also very</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:10.690" style="s2">encouraging that that we agreed on this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.620" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s a very politically</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.690" end="00:13:16.779" style="s2">tricky issue because very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:20.370" style="s2">talk to state actors to international</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.779" end="00:13:22.899" style="s2">leaders and basically say you unit of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.370" end="00:13:26.350" style="s2">administration and governance might be</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.899" end="00:13:29.140" style="s2">an anachronism in the planetary era but</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.350" end="00:13:31.480" style="s2">maybe it is also important to open this</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.140" end="00:13:34.120" style="s2">conversation because so much of national</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.480" end="00:13:37.720" style="s2">boundaries have been created in a time</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.120" end="00:13:42.339" style="s2">but relatively recently at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.720" end="00:13:46.149" style="s2">the era of empires as Robert Gilman puts</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.339" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">it five thousand year period where we</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.149" end="00:13:52.630" style="s2">started to create systems of power over</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:57.820" style="s2">and power against rather than power with</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.630" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s the split of our unity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.820" end="00:14:03.070" style="s2">enter being with the natural world that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:06.940" style="s2">created environmental scarcities that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.070" end="00:14:10.920" style="s2">then created the need to fission in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.940" end="00:14:12.130" style="s2">device divide and conquer the human</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.920" end="00:14:16.030" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.130" end="00:14:19.750" style="s2">and so we created these artificial</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.030" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">boundaries through religion and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.750" end="00:14:29.260" style="s2">through national boundaries so one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">the things another thing that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.260" end="00:14:38.440" style="s2">about is how ecosystems regeneration is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:40.270" style="s2">vitally a restoration is vitally</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.440" end="00:14:42.820" style="s2">important and how hopeful it is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.270" end="00:14:46.980" style="s2">unit and a number of actors are now very</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.820" end="00:14:50.620" style="s2">strongly behind the idea of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.980" end="00:14:53.170" style="s2">decade for ecosystems restoration which</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.620" end="00:14:55.780" style="s2">would start in 2020 and run until 2030</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.170" end="00:14:58.990" style="s2">and really that is our last hope that in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.780" end="00:15:00.940" style="s2">that decade there is such a push towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.990" end="00:15:03.520" style="s2">regeneration everywhere restore</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.940" end="00:15:08.680" style="s2">ecosystems restoration on all levels</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.520" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">that we really see a shift into what</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.680" end="00:15:13.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve been calling the century of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:16.360" style="s2">regeneration the the time where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.240" end="00:15:18.220" style="s2">really turn back the clock on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.360" end="00:15:21.940" style="s2">massive damage that humanity has caused</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.220" end="00:15:25.930" style="s2">on planet Earth and begin to reverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.940" end="00:15:28.090" style="s2">that damage and show that as life we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.930" end="00:15:33.190" style="s2">capable of creating conditions conducive</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.090" end="00:15:35.020" style="s2">to life and we also talked about how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.190" end="00:15:38.910" style="s2">need to raise awareness that this scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.020" end="00:15:42.940" style="s2">linking characteristic of health is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.910" end="00:15:45.670" style="s2">going on at all scales that basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.940" end="00:15:48.790" style="s2">you can start with cellular health it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.670" end="00:15:53.530" style="s2">about what kind of enzymes what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.790" end="00:15:56.170" style="s2">nutrients cellular nutrients and and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.530" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">much water everything like the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.170" end="00:16:02.280" style="s2">within a single cell which is in itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:05.950" style="s2">already a complex dynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.280" end="00:16:10.200" style="s2">dynamics that can either lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.950" end="00:16:12.630" style="s2">emergence of health as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.200" end="00:16:16.380" style="s2">property of that complex dynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.630" end="00:16:18.840" style="s2">of ill-health and then since that cell</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.380" end="00:16:21.210" style="s2">in many cases sits either in an</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.840" end="00:16:26.400" style="s2">environment or in a wider multicellular</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.210" end="00:16:31.640" style="s2">organism organelles is a agglomeration</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.400" end="00:16:34.440" style="s2">of cells and their emergent health so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.640" end="00:16:37.350" style="s2">the health of cells affects the health</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.440" end="00:16:41.220" style="s2">of organs our heart our brain our lungs</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.350" end="00:16:44.520" style="s2">our vital functions and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.220" end="00:16:51.090" style="s2">affects the complex dynamic system which</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.520" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">is a human individual and the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.090" end="00:16:58.110" style="s2">of health at that scale and then we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:17:00.270" style="s2">to be aware that and we look at the</p>
