<p begin="00:00:12.600" end="00:00:13.100" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">I want to tell you about a book today.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.860" end="00:00:17.860" style="s2">The book is called &quot;The Gulag Archipelago.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.180" end="00:00:20.060" style="s2">(to the camera crew) You ready?</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.820" end="00:00:25.240" style="s2">(to the students) The book is called &quot;The Gulag Archipelago,&quot; and it&#39;s by a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.620" end="00:00:28.420" style="s2">a Russian author... a Soviet author named</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.580" end="00:00:29.980" style="s2">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:30.980" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.420" end="00:00:34.520" style="s2">was in the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.180" end="00:00:38.780" style="s2">concentration camp system for a very long time. He had a very hard life.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.060" end="00:00:43.420" style="s2">He was on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.420" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">Russian front when the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.540" end="00:00:51.900" style="s2">invaded the Soviet Union in the early stages of World War II. Now,</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.740" end="00:00:56.180" style="s2">Hitler and Stalin had signed a non-aggression pact</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.160" end="00:01:04.480" style="s2">and Hitler invaded the Soviet Union anyway.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.720" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">And from what I&#39;ve been able to understand,</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.340" end="00:01:09.020" style="s2">the Soviets had prepared</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.020" end="00:01:11.800" style="s2">an invasion force for Europe at that point but were</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.440" end="00:01:15.080" style="s2">not concerned with having to defend their territory,</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.080" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">and so they were caught completely unawares by Hitler&#39;s move.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:20.900" style="s2">And the conditions on the Russian front were absolutely dreadful,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.300" end="00:01:26.980" style="s2">and Solzhenitsyn was soldier on Russian front.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:33.300" style="s2">He wrote some letters to one of his friends,</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:37.420" style="s2">which were intercepted, complaining about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.620" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">lack of preparation, and using bitter dark humor to describe</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">the situation, and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.440" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">the consequences of that was that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">he was thrown into work camp.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.600" end="00:01:53.160" style="s2">The Soviet system relied on work camps,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.100" end="00:01:56.020" style="s2">and so those were large labor camps</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.020" end="00:01:58.420" style="s2">of people who were essentially enslaved,</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.420" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">many of whom were worked to death — often froze to death — working</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.400" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">in conditions that were so dreadful, that they&#39;re virtually unimaginable.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:12.240" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn spent a very large number of years in these camps,</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.260" end="00:02:16.100" style="s2">sometimes in a more privileged camp, because he was an educated man,</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.100" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">and sometimes in worse camps.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:20.240" style="s2">He also</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">developed cancer</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">later, and wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.760" end="00:02:29.240" style="s2">book about that called &quot;Cancer Ward,&quot; which</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.380" end="00:02:31.060" style="s2">is a brilliant book.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">So, he had a very hard life.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:35.540" style="s2">There&#39;s just no way around that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.540" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2">To be on the front, and then to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:38.980" style="s2">concentration camp, and then to have cancer,</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.980" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">That&#39;s... that&#39;s pretty rough.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:42.980" style="s2">Now, he wrote &quot;The Gulag Archipelago.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.400" end="00:02:49.520" style="s2">He wrote a book called &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; first,</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.520" end="00:02:51.520" style="s2">that was published in the early 1960s,</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.520" end="00:02:57.260" style="s2">when there was a brief thaw. Stalin was pretty much out of the picture by the end of the 1950s.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.260" end="00:02:59.260" style="s2">There’s some indication that he was murdered,</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:02.620" style="s2">by Khrushchev, and Khrushchev became</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.620" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">a premier of the Soviet Union after Stalin.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:14.020" style="s2">And there’s some indication, perhaps, that Stalin was either murdered by Khrushchev and a set of his cronies,</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.020" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">or, when he was very ill, just before he died, was not helped, at least by…</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">wasn’t provided with any medical attention because of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:29.140" style="s2">intervention of Khrushchev and his cronies. Now, there&#39;s some indication as well, at that point, that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.140" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">Stalin, who was an absolute— absolutely barbaric in every possible way you could imagine,</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.320" style="s2">was planning to start a third World War.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.320" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">And he was certainly capable of doing such things, because he had already</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">imprisoned or killed tens of millions of people.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">just after Stalin died, there was a bit of a thaw in the Soviet Union with regards to internal repression.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:04:00.160" style="s2">In the early 1960s, Solzhenitsyn published a book called &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">which was a story about one day in the life — his life, really — inside one of these so-called &quot;gulag archipelago&quot; camps.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:09.440" style="s2">Now, he called it the &quot;gulag archipelago&quot; because</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.440" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">an &quot;archipelago&quot; is a chain of islands, and so Solzhenitsyn likened the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:20.960" style="s2">work-camp system in the Soviet Union, which is made of isolated camps distributed across the entire state...</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.960" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">He likened that to a series of islands, and hence the metaphor.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">And &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; was one of the first publications released in the Soviet Union that dared make public</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:37.760" style="s2">what had happened inside these camps, at least initially.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.760" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">Now, that thought didn&#39;t last very long, but that book had a tremendous effect.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">It&#39;s a short book; it&#39;s worth reading.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.760" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">After that, he spent— he wrote a number of other books which were also—</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">He&#39;s a great literary figure; in the same category, I would say, as Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, which is,</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">like, really saying something, you know. Those two are perhaps the greatest literary figures who ever lived,</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:01.200" style="s2">with the possible exception of Shakespeare.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.200" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">He wrote this book called &quot;The Gulag Archipelago,&quot; which is published in three volumes, each of which is about 700 pages long.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">The first one details the origin of the oppressive Soviet system, at least in part under Lenin, and then its full-fledged implementation</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">under Stalin and the deaths of...</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:27.040" style="s2">Well, Solzhenitsyn estimated the deaths in internal repression in the Soviet Union at</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.200" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">something approximating sixty million, between 1919 and 1959.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">Now, that doesn&#39;t count the death toll in the second World War, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">Now, people have disputed those figures, but they&#39;re certainly in the tens of millions, and the low-end bounds are probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">twenty million, and the high-end bounds are near what Solzhenitsyn estimated... He also estimated that the same kind of internal repression in Maoist China</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">cost a hundred million lives, and so you can imagine that the genuine historical figures, again, are subject to dispute,</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">but somewhere between fifty and a hundred million people. And one of the things that&#39;s really surprising to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">and that I think is absolutely reprehensible — absolutely reprehensible — is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">this is not widespread knowledge among students in the West.any of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s because your education -</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">your historical  education</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.500" end="00:15:24.500" style="s2">Establishing the legal and practical framework for a series of camps where political prisoners and ordinary criminals would be sentenced to forced labor.</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.860" end="00:15:33.860" style="s2">One of the things that&#39;s quite interesting about the gulag camps, and this is something that&#39;s very relevant to understanding modern Russia is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.860" end="00:15:39.300" style="s2">so, ordinary criminals were put into the camps, and so were political prisoners.</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.300" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">but the ordinary criminals, and so those would be rapists and murderers, let&#39;s say, as well as thieves</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:43.480" style="s2">who were engaged in theft as an occupation.</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.480" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">Those were regarded by the Soviets as &quot;socially friendly&quot; elements.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">And the reason for that was that they assumed that the reason that these people had turned to crime was because of the oppressive nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:16:00.180" style="s2">of the previous Czarist/Capitalist system. And that the only reason that these criminals existed</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.180" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">was because they had been oppressed -- they were oppressed victims of that system</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:09.520" style="s2">and so one of the convenient consequences of that absolutely insane doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.520" end="00:16:13.460" style="s2">was that the Soviets put the ordinary criminals in charge of the camps.</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.060" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">And these were very, very seriously bad people, and so,</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:20.960" style="s2">you can imagine the way that they treated the political prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.960" end="00:16:23.760" style="s2">who were regarded as socially hostile elements,</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.760" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">sometimes because of their own hypothetically traitorous acts, but more often</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.540" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">merely as a consequence of their racial or ethnic identity,</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:35.420" style="s2">or the fact that they were related by birth to, say, people who had been succcessful</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.940" end="00:16:37.860" style="s2">under the previous systems, so who had any</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.180" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">any association with nobility or any association with were known as the Kulaks,</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:47.180" style="s2">who were the only successful class of former peasants in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.740" end="00:16:51.780" style="s2">Because they were regarded as &quot;privileged.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.780" end="00:16:53.420" style="s2">You may have heard that word more recently.</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.420" end="00:16:59.300" style="s2">They were regarded as &quot;privileged&quot; and therefore as enemies of the state. And it didn&#39;t matter if it was your father, or your grandfather, or your great-grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.300" end="00:17:01.520" style="s2">who happened to be &quot;privileged,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.280" end="00:17:08.680" style="s2">but the mere fact that you were a member of that group was sufficient reason to put you into a camp.</p>
