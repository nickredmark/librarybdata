<p begin="00:00:05.769" end="00:00:09.969" style="s2">with you about what I think is one of</p>

<p begin="00:00:19.119" end="00:00:24.429" style="s2">with many social psychological benefits</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.060" end="00:00:27.550" style="s2">that are now well documented and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.429" end="00:00:30.009" style="s2">for the spreading of ideas or more</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.550" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">accurately for the persistence of the</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.320" end="00:00:36.430" style="s2">last across multiple generations of time</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.360" end="00:00:39.340" style="s2">the book that I&#39;m reviewing today is</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.340" end="00:00:44.620" style="s2">evolutionary origins of religious</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.170" end="00:00:47.649" style="s2">thought bypass cowboy yay now this book</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.620" end="00:00:49.270" style="s2">was written in the early 1990s but even</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.649" end="00:00:49.780" style="s2">though it&#39;s almond though it&#39;s about 20</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.270" end="00:00:52.809" style="s2">years old</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.780" end="00:00:54.250" style="s2">it&#39;s still extremely relevant to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.809" end="00:00:56.710" style="s2">happening in the world today because</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.250" end="00:01:01.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a work of anthropology that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.710" end="00:01:04.620" style="s2">establishes a key domain of human</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.180" end="00:01:07.570" style="s2">behavior or human evolution if you will</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.620" end="00:01:09.010" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t change very much and as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.570" end="00:01:11.170" style="s2">building block for other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.010" end="00:01:14.200" style="s2">knowledge says book religion explained</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.170" end="00:01:16.750" style="s2">has now become a foundational piece in</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.200" end="00:01:19.330" style="s2">an entirely new field of research called</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.750" end="00:01:21.670" style="s2">cognitive anthropology of religion and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.330" end="00:01:25.330" style="s2">cognitive anthropology of religion looks</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.670" end="00:01:27.490" style="s2">at the relationship between ethnographic</p>

<p begin="00:01:27.490" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">and human evolution the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.280" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">typically done in anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">cognitive science in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:40.870" style="s2">construction of concepts linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:43.030" style="s2">intent or communication and the</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.030" end="00:01:47.380" style="s2">person&#39;s mind to another so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.130" end="00:01:50.380" style="s2">that makes ideas able to spread easily</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.380" end="00:01:53.530" style="s2">we&#39;re able to stay the same easily and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.380" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">so this book religion explained offers</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.530" end="00:01:59.470" style="s2">the first I don&#39;t know about the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:02.470" style="s2">necessarily but for its time the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.470" end="00:02:04.660" style="s2">comprehensive understanding or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.470" end="00:02:07.540" style="s2">theoretical perspective for how</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.660" end="00:02:10.600" style="s2">religious ideas are formed what makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.540" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">religious ideas so sticky and the minds</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.600" end="00:02:14.790" style="s2">of people and able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:16.950" style="s2">be transmitted from one generation to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.790" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">the next so in many ways you could think</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.950" end="00:02:21.390" style="s2">of this as a theory of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">transmission for religious ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.390" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">what boy a does that&#39;s just it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:29.010" style="s2">brilliant and I&#39;ve I still refer back to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:30.840" style="s2">it even though I read this book more</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.010" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">than ten years ago it&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.840" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">coming back on my mind is he looked at</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">the make up of ideas and what makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">ideas psychologically sticky</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:43.050" style="s2">what makes ideas something that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:45.209" style="s2">to spread from one person to another and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.050" end="00:02:48.390" style="s2">what he found was that for all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.209" end="00:02:49.800" style="s2">key categories for everyday life so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.390" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">category for what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.800" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">person the category for what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">to be a tool that gets used you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:02:59.819" style="s2">what makes something a tool or what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:01.890" style="s2">makes something a piece of furniture in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.819" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">these kinds of categories in life that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.890" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">the most powerful way to create an idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">that spreads is to make it both novel</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">and new kind of unexpected and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:16.019" style="s2">surprising enough that it catches</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">people&#39;s attention but similar enough to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.019" end="00:03:20.280" style="s2">what was already there that people can</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:22.350" style="s2">make sense of it so for example he found</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.280" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">that with the category of person there</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.350" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">are several features or attributes of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">personhood that are commonplace you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">people are you know you&#39;re a person if</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:32.519" style="s2">you have a mind you&#39;re a person if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">have a body you&#39;re a person if you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.519" end="00:03:37.950" style="s2">a consistent accumulation of memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:40.950" style="s2">across time things like this and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.950" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">found that all supernatural concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.950" end="00:03:45.450" style="s2">every religious system that he studied</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:48.420" style="s2">in boy a as an anthropologist has looked</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">at hundreds of indigenous religions as</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.420" end="00:03:52.320" style="s2">well as the major world religions he</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">found that all religious concepts have</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.320" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">the same basic recipe they take a normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">category like the category of a person</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">and then they violate one or two of its</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">expected behaviors the behavior of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">category of person but not more than</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">that so it&#39;s something that&#39;s novel and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">surprising but so but still mostly like</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">what people are coming what people</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">so for example for the category of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">person what is it if you have a person</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:20.990" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:23.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a mind so you take the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.990" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">aspect away from person the person</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.060" end="00:04:26.840" style="s2">without a mind is what we call a zombie</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.100" style="s2">what does a person that is a person in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.840" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">every way except they don&#39;t have a body</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.100" end="00:04:34.100" style="s2">that is a disembodied soul or a spirit</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:35.750" style="s2">or a ghost so he took this idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.100" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">take the category of person and change</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.750" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">one of its attributes but not more you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">get a novel and surprising concept and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.310" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">people remember it want to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s understandable so people can</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:48.170" style="s2">make sense of it and then he applied</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">this basic litmus test to all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.170" end="00:04:52.310" style="s2">religious concepts and found that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.210" end="00:04:54.530" style="s2">could create religious ideas that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.310" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">never find in religions so like imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.530" end="00:04:58.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a God who is all-powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">all-knowing but he immediately forgets</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.010" end="00:05:02.420" style="s2">everything that he knows you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">gonna find a category like that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.420" end="00:05:07.730" style="s2">it&#39;s so nonsensical it violates several</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.480" end="00:05:10.460" style="s2">of the tenants of what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.730" end="00:05:12.500" style="s2">person that it just is nonsensical</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.460" end="00:05:14.420" style="s2">people can&#39;t remember it they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.500" end="00:05:16.910" style="s2">communicate it so it just doesn&#39;t spread</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.420" end="00:05:20.450" style="s2">so he takes this basic idea and then he</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.910" end="00:05:23.090" style="s2">introduces an entire perspective a huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.450" end="00:05:25.490" style="s2">lens of evolutionary thinking to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.090" end="00:05:27.260" style="s2">field of religious study especially the</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.260" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">this book is probably the best most</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:35.300" style="s2">comprehensive analysis of this approach</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:37.040" style="s2">and I highly recommend it for anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.300" end="00:05:39.230" style="s2">wants to understand how religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.040" end="00:05:41.750" style="s2">systems come into being how they change</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.230" end="00:05:44.420" style="s2">in time and in particular the way that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.750" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">that memes spread from one mind to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.420" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">another to enable religious systems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:51.860" style="s2">persist and to slowly and not to quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:54.530" style="s2">change in time so there you go religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.860" end="00:05:56.630" style="s2">religion explained by Pascal boy a must</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.530" end="00:05:58.700" style="s2">read for any culture designer who wants</p>
