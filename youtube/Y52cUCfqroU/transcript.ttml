<p begin="00:00:05.359" end="00:00:11.440" style="s2">whenever mark&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:14.000" style="s2">sorry yeah my internet&#39;s a bit iffy so</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.440" end="00:00:17.760" style="s2">sorry mark can you say it again</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.000" end="00:00:20.000" style="s2">sure so um i i think i know</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">you&#39;re going with this but but can you</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.000" end="00:00:23.119" style="s2">tell me how you</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">arrived at that conclusion because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.119" end="00:00:26.960" style="s2">not sure you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">so i&#39;m just trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.960" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">what led you there</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">so first</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">i thought okay so with</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">me the traditional meta you&#39;re just sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:42.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">you know you&#39;re radiating compassion</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.160" end="00:00:46.719" style="s2">towards people</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:47.920" style="s2">so it seemed like you were actively</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:50.000" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.920" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">cultivate the perspective of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:55.840" style="s2">compassionate person and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">the virtue of compassion and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.840" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">but then john john&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:06.320" style="s2">of meta seems to be like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:06.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s sort of like a indirect way</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:13.960" style="s2">cultivating something else which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">understanding that your your</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.960" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">co-identifications</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">like with others are not</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">like fixed and you there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">more to people and it appears</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">and then like recently i&#39;ve looked into</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">what exactly he meant by reverence</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.799" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">and that basically is what reverend says</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">it seems to be that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">you&#39;re because obviously all it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">relating properly to all which is like</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">it&#39;s got something to do with curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:53.680" style="s2">going beyond</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">you know the the common like your own</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">understanding of things just remaining</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.079" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">that you the reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.079" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">always exceeds you and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">drawing you beyond</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">you know your your conceptions and so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">meta is about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">trying to remind yourself that the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">you&#39;re co-identifying</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">you know isn&#39;t all there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">and therefore to create more</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">i&#39;d call it participatory flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">then it seems like you are basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">reverence</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">okay so i and i&#39;d love to hear what ben</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">has to say about this but my</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">understanding of meta is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">always doing those things we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">and maybe john&#39;s emphasis is a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">bit different but i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">reverence is an emergence from</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">meta with moreness and suchness or</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">as the as the additional focus so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">a lot of the ecologies overlap and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a perspectival overlap here with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">everything everything has a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">aspect which i think is primary actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">for lots of reasons i don&#39;t think john</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">would disagree with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a bunch of stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">participatory to your point</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a bunch of stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">about reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s the moreness versus the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">suchness so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">suchness is the grounding and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">moreness is the opening to new</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">potential or possibility and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">reason why he does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">is to is to do that opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">did you stop talking or if i lost</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">connection</p>

<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">because it sounded just like a yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">and yeah i&#39;m curious to hear what ben</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">thinks</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">well velocity what i was going to ask</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">you if that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">if your sense of this is consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">your practice of meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">or how that&#39;s showing up for you in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">life it&#39;s just it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">baby idea like i&#39;m not i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">meta the whole may you&#39;d be happy</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">well and free of suffering so far</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve been thinking about changing</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">to the morning suchness thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">but but it also it sort of seemed a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">like uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">so i was just playing around with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">whole maybe it is literally just the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">cultivation of reverence and then that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">connect to me so i&#39;m wondering do you</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">teaching no i haven&#39;t caught up to it</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">i&#39;ll just inject this as another thread</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">rather than as any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">yes or no he put meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">confusion between having mode and being</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">as i say this isn&#39;t to say yes or no to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">where you&#39;re going with it but</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">just to put a new thread maybe it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:49.879" style="s2">go anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">so using meta as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.879" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">psychotechnology to what did he say</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">better contemplation is the way to fix</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">that seems to fit because i&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">of the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">as being a rigidity</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">of perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">kind of assume it then you leave it</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">static and then you get on</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">and then you a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">so creative with your proposition on</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">um procedure on</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">like you assume it&#39;s sort of like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">assuming that what you value</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">and the way that you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">things is right</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">you don&#39;t really reflect him anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">achieving the goal whereas i i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">think as the being knows the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">yeah i think i think all that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">uh airports are loud by the way so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">sorry about that um i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">regular meta does this right but what</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">john does is add in the concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">opponent processing with the moreness</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">and the suchness and detach the rooting</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">versus the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">expansion so you see this for example in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">the practice the the seated moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">and then the chakra expansion lesson</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">that he does in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">so he kind of emphasizes this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">going from rooted</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">to expanding and that&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">opponent processing but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">flexibility and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">opening you up for the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">reverence so i don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">training revenge</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">but opening the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">um also earlier there was discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">curiosity and uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">a word adjacent to that that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">interesting in similar conversations is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">wonder</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">as the like curiosity is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">seeking of the next proposition whereas</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">wonder is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">the participatory analogy of that of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">seeking how the mystery will unfold next</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">so that might be useful language</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">you might have to come again there</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">jarvis i didn&#39;t hear any of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">oh i&#39;m sorry um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">how do i send now</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">that came through okay um</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just the word wonder which um</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">like when making the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">like taking the participatory to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">fixed</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">and seeking more in the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard that be described as</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">curiosity in contrast to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.320" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">which is seeking more in the unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">again i don&#39;t know sorry sorry i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">i think that&#39;s you jules not because i</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">i&#39;m hearing in the pie come on</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">oh i can&#39;t i&#39;ll drop out and come back</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">oh gosh</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">um yeah well i guess i got my point</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">is that all good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">that sounds right to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">yeah i it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m getting a bit too often a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">tangent</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">the i&#39;ve been thinking there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">this idea that maybe there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">virtue there&#39;s like two versions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">each virtue there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">maybe we could say epistemic and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">there&#39;s one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">ethical so you might say curiosity you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">the pair of curiosity and wonder the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">sort of doing the same thing but</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">curiosity is more about gaining</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">propositions and procedures i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:13.720" style="s2">and the others about gaining</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.720" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">participatory performances</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">and then maybe you could replicate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">other things like uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t know what word to use but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">doubt and something</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:41.920" style="s2">to go along with curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:41.920" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">i&#39;d be interested where humility fits</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">into that as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">that might be it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">no no no it&#39;s definitely very relevant</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">because to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.800" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">like the what the wonder promotes</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s a recognition that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">are insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re not complete</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">but that that goes both for</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t there is more that i can</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">should we say gain but it also goes for</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">maybe what i&#39;ve got now</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">i also like thinking about it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">of humility</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">because experientially when i experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">curiosity it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of from a uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">egotistic proud standpoint of oh let me</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">examine this and so i can control it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">understand it whereas</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">the wonders and maybe this is where</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">reverence comes into</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">is the stronger sense of humility and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">that comes from that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t think you can directly</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">train wonder</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">or reverence i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">second-order effects</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">right and then the way you engender them</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">by increasing your perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">and uh focusing</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">on opening up right and the opening up</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">will take care of the humility</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">automatically</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">so this is just one of those overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">things because this theme is elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">in john&#39;s ecology</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">and he talks about it in the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">series so</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">the prajna is very much like this too</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">where you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">you know when you get to prajna it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">like whoa what are you actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">here i mean i don&#39;t i can&#39;t even do the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">prajna</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">but but i don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">like i said in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">current meditation tradition that meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t already enable that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">i think that john may be emphasizing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">more but</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">like i i don&#39;t ben would be the only one</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">that could answer something like that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">some of the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">maybe emphasize the whole humility and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">reverence side of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">but but but it&#39;s not a direct effect</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s more like if you&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll get reverence</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">if you do this maybe you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">i think i can kind of see your point</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">about it it&#39;s hard to teach someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">humility but i think i</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">want to push back a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">idea that you can&#39;t try to cultivate it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">maybe after the fact after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:55.759" style="s2">experienced it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve come to value humility and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.759" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">reverence</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">and wonder that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">try to cultivate that i think i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">mixed success in my</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">attempts personally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">actually i think i was saying the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">opposite i like the word cultivate i</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">like how you picked up on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">right so you&#39;re putting forth a field</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">with the appropriate seeds and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">soil and water cultivate reverence</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">it right it just means that you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">likely to get it if you invite it in</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">or if you invite these other uh things</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">in that are close to reverence</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">and that i think is is is what john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">going after</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">i think john&#39;s very humble in what this</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">can what can be achieved</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">etc but but meta i&#39;ve i&#39;ve always seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:49.680" style="s2">engendering the sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">will increase all wonder and reverence</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:52.959" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">time anyway and it really is just a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.959" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">difference between a duck for john he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">just emphasizing that one piece</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">and he does he does this with vipassana</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">and mindfulness too right he changes</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">them just slightly</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">or focuses them in a different way than</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">say from normal</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">uh because he&#39;s after a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">goal but but i think those things are</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">all the things he&#39;s trying to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">are things like that right i think his</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">main thrust is to cultivate virtue or</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">right or things that are like virtues</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">yeah this this reminds me of something</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">actually so</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">the way so you know how</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s often said that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.840" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">academics like the more you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:37.919" style="s2">more you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t know or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">i think like that that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">fact that each time you learn</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">something you&#39;re witnessing directly</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">the insufficiency of your own</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">you know knowledge set or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">i can see why like i&#39;m connecting this</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">to how you say</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t like deliberately like teach</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">or get</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">wonder but you have to cultivate it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">by repeatedly like going going through</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">some level of transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">so you can directly witness you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">you&#39;re directly witnessing how there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:26.160" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">to reality you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.160" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">how you can go beyond rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">told</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">for some reason when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">velocity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">verse in proverbs which is coming to my</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:46.559" style="s2">mind which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">the fear of the lord is the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.559" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not to be evangelical but rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">to point to what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">first having a transformative experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">leads you into that wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">recognition of your own</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">relative ignorance compared to the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">wisdom if you&#39;re looking in that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">lens in that transformed</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">lens</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">i also feel the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">uh versus directly seeking</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">lines up with the modal confusion um</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">that rather than try to have wonder you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">have perhaps you try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">be um open or</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">be a field that can support a crop</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">so that one&#39;s up for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">yeah i feel like a lot of this goes back</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.679" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">to my thesis about meditation being</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">about second order effects</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">right and if that&#39;s true then what</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is cultivating the field</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">and hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">something germinates or something like</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">that and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">in which case for anything you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">that might be the case i agree</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">but if you&#39;re going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">statement that if you meditate you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">get x</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">then i&#39;m going to disagree uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">for for most things</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">like like about the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">meditation can give you directly that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">you can measure is something like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">slower heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">and even that&#39;s not 100 so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">yeah there are still issues like your</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">oxygenation levels go up your heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">modulate we&#39;ll say uh there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">of other things</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">uh your brainwave state changes right</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">and and then that engenders a long</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">lasting effect</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">uh uh across the three axes we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">other than that it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">uh uh what else it would give you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">a that&#39;s a first order effect we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">i really like the old the design thing i</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">always heard</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">which is um enlightenment is an accident</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">meditation makes you accident praying</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">oh i love that i&#39;m all in yeah i like</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">adopt that i think that was a really uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">i think that was a really salient use of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">the term in in just the right way</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">right because cultivation doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">success right it just means you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">and and i think that&#39;s really where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">at i think that&#39;s what john&#39;s going for</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">feel free to add to this one</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">the phenomenology of it what led you to</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:44.380" style="s2">is cultivating reverence</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i could explain anymore</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">about what led me to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">maybe you won&#39;t hear what i said it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">just basically uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been on this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.240" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">contemplations</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">where we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">cultivate virtues specifically</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">so i had this</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">so like i i had this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">let&#39;s take three virtues i had what i</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">call compassion which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:37.200" style="s2">you know seeing others as valuable like</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">uh prudence just seeing your future self</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">like your present self</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">and uh and then en</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">encretia which is just general sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">not being immediate impression</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">so the idea would be that say with</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">you you put yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting down specifically to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">the mind the perspective of someone who</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">you know genuinely just values</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">and by doing that you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">sort of practicing to be compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">in everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">and uh so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">i was that was just sort of in my head</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">and then um yeah i was also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">wrap my head around meta properly</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">because it just seemed like my idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">compassion but then john&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">much suchness and moreness which didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">make too much sense and then i had the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">problem of faith versus remembrance</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">and then when it was said that reverence</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">is a forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">virtue it just sort of clicked that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">and then i obviously have here the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">description of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">it just seemed to sound a lot like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">people were supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful oh it&#39;s so so it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">listening to the woodruff podcast that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">you made that connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">yes i think i think that was mainly what</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">did it oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">what part of it why&#39;d you do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid i don&#39;t have a good enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">memory for details to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">i just remember that&#39;s a big big one</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">but yeah like the matter that john has</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">described so far i&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">episode 50 of the meditation series</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">that what he seems to have described is</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">what i said about like you&#39;re taking a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">virtue and you&#39;re putting yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">the mind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">the one who has the virtue and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">like that&#39;s sort of what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">metal or you&#39;re trying to put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">in the mind of the person who is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">reverent</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">i had a slightly different take on meta</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">if i could share that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">i are you still picking me up sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">yeah oh good so my</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">recollection of it if you&#39;ve only done</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">it recently then</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">you&#39;re closer to the event than i am to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">be honest but my</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">experience with meta was you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">projecting</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">from within yourself toward</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">initially others and then expanding i</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">think somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">mark said previously expanding that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">out more broadly so my experience of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">was just thinking about my son</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">for example and looking at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">specifically special about him</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">then looking more broadly what&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:16.640" style="s2">about him just as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">creature you know as a human moving on</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">to my wife</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.440" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">moving on to other family members etc</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">my experience wasn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">what would you say mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">as such more</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">witnessing them without getting too</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">over the top about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">sorry what what thing then sorry i</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t hear the verb</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">my felt experience of it was that i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">witnessing them</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">yeah i like i like that witnessing i i</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">think that&#39;s good i don&#39;t know velascan</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">where you&#39;re getting the entering the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">mind of somebody with reverence i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">somebody can model reverence for you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">right and you can accept and reject it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">but i&#39;m not sure how you would</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">do it imaginely</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">it sounds like deity yoga or hedon</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">meditation to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">most correctly</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.039" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">so in in buddhist tantra he might</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">visualize a bodhisattva</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">and arise as that bodhisattva uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">imaginably right um and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">putting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">in the perspective of an enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the uh the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">direct correspondent of that that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">aware of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll send you a piece on that just to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">clarify</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">yeah i like you invoke tantra there</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely where i was going in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">tantra you would definitely do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">right this is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">idea that i have that the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.480" style="s2">spiritual physicians are half theist</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:23.679" style="s2">because sometimes you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.480" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">embody</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.679" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">or or or interact with</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">uh something like a deity right even</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">though if you see them in the road</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to run them over you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">still supposed to have that idea that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">that sometimes you&#39;re supposed to mirror</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">that right that&#39;s supposed to be your</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">ideal</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s just not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">supposed to follow that ideal</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">exclusively and that&#39;s what it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">sort of half theist</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">so yeah in tantra i definitely see that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t see that so much in john&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">because again i think he&#39;s going for</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">i think the two things he&#39;s going for</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">by you know in the modifications he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">making will say to the to to to what i</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">understand the traditions to be and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a poor understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">is is he&#39;s trying to engender something</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">that he thinks might be reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">opening and i think he&#39;s right about</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">and and he&#39;s also trying to engender</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">right prajna is all opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">so when he makes modifications</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">those are the two types of things i</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">think he&#39;s modifying</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">the current traditions to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:25.840" style="s2">engender we&#39;ll say i i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">that&#39;s true but there&#39;s definitely sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.840" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">of that idea of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">in the eastern spiritual traditions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">also you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">uh possible but but i don&#39;t think john</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">after those</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">in particular although maybe he should</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">be maybe we can expand the ecology that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">i could imagine though that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">a functional way in which like even if</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:01.039" style="s2">you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">uh overtly setting out to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.039" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">take on the mind of a reverent person</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">it&#39;s still possible that like</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">by the end of the practice that is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve ended up doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">if that makes sense but i&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">experienced with matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">well it could end up happening to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">right that&#39;s back to the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">like i like the cultivation right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">in meditation you&#39;re cultivating the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">field for a bunch of second order</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">effects or something i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">way to frame it that might be uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">really useful and then the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">would be why do so many people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">meditate not get</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">what they want out of it or anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">useful or you know there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">ways we could slice that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">right they still have uh the the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">the profound event and they still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">integrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">mark you should know that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">traditional way to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">meta practice is with the phrase uh meta</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">bhavana</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">and bhavana one of the meanings of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:09.039" style="s2">word is uh it&#39;s translated as</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.039" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">as in growing a crop or something so</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">it is certainly a connection which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">and i guess we can kind of see this</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">happening in joel&#39;s vessels</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">veloskin&#39;s experience of</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">uh witnessing uh versus at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">taking uh entering into the mind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">as as just like two possible things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">can spring up within this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">cultivation process</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">i think a connection you can make to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">witnessing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">is the suchness right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">recognizing the specifics without</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">impeding yourself between</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">those those your observation and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:35.840" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">and then the the opposite thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">would be like projecting that person</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">into the future right</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">seeing the potential and then that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">that would be the mourners done right</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">and then the mourners your understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:54.559" style="s2">of the monas</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">can inform</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.559" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">your observation the suchness and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">cycle</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">yeah manuel i like that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">points to the reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">sort of uh mechanism that john&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">create or whatever or uh engender i</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t know that about cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">ben thank you for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">i mean i kind of figured it was in there</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">but all the words and the translations</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">you know it it it takes uh somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">studies</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">uh that sort of stuff uh really well</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">like yourself to go through that i never</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">had the patience</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">um so so i mean that&#39;s good like like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the same things</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">i i like what you said emanuel about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">the the suchness is the witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">right i think that&#39;s deeply true right</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">and then the moreness is something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">the opening</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">right the the possibility the uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">confrontation with potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">right the unstuckness in time i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">all that tied up in the in the mornings</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s also brought to mind the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">walking like the the walking with one</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">foot being meditation</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">looking at the suchness and the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">foot being</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">looking through the mornings</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">like the you&#39;re sort of replicating that</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">yeah john talks a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.839" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">ecology&#39;s stacking</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">layering and overlapping those are his</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">three big things when he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">ecologies and what makes good ecology</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">oh and linking yeah that was the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">one there&#39;s a linking in there too yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">he talks a lot about that when</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about the ecology so um i</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know how well that comes out in</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">the series but when i&#39;ve talked to him</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">directly about ecologies those are the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">words he</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">he emphasizes the most when we had our</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">ecology&#39;s discussion we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve heard him say it quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.839" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference between stacking</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">and layering in that description</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m i&#39;m not really sure how how</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">john&#39;s making the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">specific distinction but i i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">higher order practices versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">that that fit on top of right or fit</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">below</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">uh versus uh an overlap right</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">and and you know sort of laying two</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">into one another but that are at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">same level we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">of interaction or function or something</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">yeah i like that that&#39;s those are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">images that come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">one is like you&#39;re building a tower and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">you need the lower levels before it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">and the other is you have these two</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">parts these two lenses one</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">what you&#39;re left with</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">i really should have recorded this</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">i am you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.839" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">although it&#39;s a wonder how much of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">will actually come through given how</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">broken conversations are that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">like everybody&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">issues yes it&#39;s very frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">you guys hear me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">so i wanted to take a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">tack</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">on your initial proposition</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">uh which is the word reverence</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">no this might be more manuel&#39;s game so</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">jump in manuel please but</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to think of the root word</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">there and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if verity or veritas has</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">something to do with the center of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">something to do with truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">what does ask about this um</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">yeah i love my etymologies it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.960" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">i know it has not got anything to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">with truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">okay very stand in all</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">your respects ah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">so like reverie okay yeah i get it</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">okay red hearing</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.839" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s got something it&#39;s got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">similar roots to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.839" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">respect like that means to look back</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">and the the vera is just sort of pay</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">attention to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">instead of just look so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very perspectival language</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">is it not quite sure see</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">well there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely an</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:25.800" style="s2">element</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">where there&#39;s a negation or or</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.800" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">de-significant of the self</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">there that that is probably the main</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">part of right like you&#39;re being put into</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">contrast to something else right where</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">something else is determining you as</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">opposed to the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">yeah because i guess i think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">at least at the moment the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">ourselves is more of a suchness thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">it&#39;s what we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">so i&#39;m noticing we&#39;re coming up towards</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">the end of our scheduled times</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">working on various projects</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">they want to tune in there oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t get anything but yeah if if</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">anyone didn&#39;t hear that please</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t have a an official project</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">but have something to share which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">related okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:42:01.839" style="s2">okay um a few of you i think</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">generating around it and i just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">dropped in on it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">and uh had been speaking the previous</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">day with</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">thought oh that&#39;s really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">also thinking to myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">how could i serve into the community a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">little bit so</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">how from his perspective i thought it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">be helpful for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">can can you all hear me by the way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">i thought it&#39;d be helpful because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s an attractive kind of community</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">but sort of mysterious to many people</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">including myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">so i thought yeah i&#39;m going to arrange a</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">my position is going to be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">relate as a christian as well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">make sense of uh john&#39;s teaching like</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">you know and frankly since he&#39;s betting</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">on ritna</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">as the way forward why don&#39;t we take</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">that seriously</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">what does that look like seriously</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">so i&#39;ll put that in the announcement as</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">uh manuel suggested</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">focus on getting a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">structure going so</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">maybe get everybody up to date on</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">what&#39;s still happening where we intend</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">to be going</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">and that kind of stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll have to think that through</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">i guess the projects have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">mainly fallen a bit flat at this point</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">i&#39;m still doing my like i i&#39;ve shelved</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">perennial problems thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">i had a sort of sense of the very broad</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">broader definition of perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:35.359" style="s2">that john uses that includes it but goes</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">beyond it to things sort of like oh well</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.359" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">we all need to deal with death</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">and interpersonal conflict and so on</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">now i&#39;m on uh practices ecology is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">the whole practices thing because i feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">like it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">so yeah we should maybe just have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">session where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">literally just talk about what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">projects we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">take on although to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">usually we go on for another about 40</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">minutes from here so we could do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">now unless there&#39;s some problem with</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.839" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">take the wheel</p>

<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">again broader than john perennial needs</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">which were a more</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">positive thing which shivarani took on</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">religions but i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">has really gone anywhere just yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">uh manus i don&#39;t know if he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">alternative narrative construction i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">not sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">that&#39;s about exactly oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">yeah like seeing dialogues as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">narrative which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">strewn&#39;s idea so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">yeah people can go ahead and field some</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">what other projects to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">for my parts i would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">analysis religions i think was more</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">marx&#39;s idea than</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">um and that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">he was disputing some of my claims</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">um the other project</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">uh with respect to dear lordless</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">narrative i guess i&#39;m sort of working on</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">the background anyway</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">do we have the um problem defined</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">sufficiently that we can start</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">working on the problem itself oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good point like all</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">of these projects we we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">we came to conclusion on the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">retinal meeting</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">that we want to focus on problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">so we&#39;re not focusing so much on you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">know answers about what written is going</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">to be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">we&#39;re focusing more on what problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">trying to trying to solve with retina</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">well i think that ties into the um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">question that i</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">posed to you the other day</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">that i think this is actually a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">because if we at the video series that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:21.520" style="s2">uh john has started with uh craig</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">enriquez</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.520" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">um where they are talking about the hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">problem of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s a good question to ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">uh what is the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">consciousness supposed to solve with</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">respect to the meaning christ</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">like why is this particular problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">being included in the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">formulation</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">should it be there in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">anyway so yeah i don&#39;t expect anybody to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">have answers to that question at the top</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">of it but i think it&#39;s something that i</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:58.480" style="s2">would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">being around but in a written our</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.480" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">discussion context that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">because yeah it&#39;s not entirely clear to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">me why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">relevant at all to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">yeah yeah the thing that comes</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">though i do i i kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">part of it&#39;s already been laid out in</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">the the histo</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">historical factors of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">like i think the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">is very much trying to resolve the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.280" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">decartean</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">uh cartesian paradox of um</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">you know are we enlightened or are we</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">romantic and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">if we can come up with a sami</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">enlightenment model</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">that really does justice to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">consciousness then</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">that&#39;s addressing a historical factor at</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">the very least</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">so what you&#39;re suggesting is that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:19.599" style="s2">dualism and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">the heart problem of consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.599" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">that causes</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">by when two people who operate on it</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:28.160" style="s2">at least from an enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.000" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who have a problem so</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">with respect to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">it&#39;s only a meaning crisis problem if</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:37.520" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">trying to argue for enlightenment not</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">romanticism to understand you correctly</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.839" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.880" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">argue from enlightenment um</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">but i feel like there was criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">romanticism as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.400" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">yeah yeah no but i&#39;m saying like like so</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">so to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">to rephrase what i&#39;m saying is um</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.359" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">because the question initially was is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:08.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">what does the heart what does solving</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">the heart problem of consciousness do if</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">and then you gave me your answer and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">i&#39;m rephrasing what you said</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m saying um so what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">that like solving the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">consciousness is useful if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">to argue for an enlightenment kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">uh position as opposed to a romantic</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:28.319" style="s2">position</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.319" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">distinction between like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">the heart solving the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">consciousness is kind of useless to him</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">like would that be would that be a valid</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">inference to draw from what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">maybe yeah i mean like i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a middle ground</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">between the two where we still have</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">souls but we can make logical sense of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">and i guess the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">consciousness in that framing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">you&#39;re putting is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">trying to reach that middle ground from</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">the enlightenment side</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s one of the angles on this</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">minion crisis okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s certainly a a</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">plausible answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">uh that&#39;s that&#39;s just what jumps out i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">super interested to hear what continues</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">to be revealed or</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">like what other inputs people might come</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">up with on their own</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">yeah i think there was somebody else who</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">wanted to say something it was like lots</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">of people talking at the same time there</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">like a few minutes ago though</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">well i was gonna say that i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">really see the value of solving it</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">unless the solution is so complicated</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s inaccessible for most people</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">uh well it might might help with</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">constructing like the ecology for</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">example right like if</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">if there&#39;s some profound insight in</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">how we make connections or something</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">that we can more efficiently make</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">the connections with that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see any spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">value in in it i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">go for it</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">are you gonna say drills</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">got some australian internet going on</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">lights up</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">i get booted out so i&#39;ll keep an eye on</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">i um i could um</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">not your fault like i said i could you</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:49.040" style="s2">still hear me guys</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:49.040" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not over my laughter</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m i&#39;m sorry it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">frustrating um</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:57.920" style="s2">but i could take a stab at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">connection that john&#39;s trying to go for</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">using some of his words</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:08.319" style="s2">as to what the value might be so</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">the speculation i&#39;d make is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">he&#39;s saying it connects ultimately to</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">our capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:18.720" style="s2">relevance realization so how does that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">tie into spirituality i&#39;m guessing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.720" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">way that it does</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">is that he&#39;s going to replace you still</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">hear me</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:32.640" style="s2">man well yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">so he&#39;s going to replace consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.640" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">outside of the split from descartes</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">onwards he&#39;s going to replace it with</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">fixing the nature problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">he&#39;s going to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.000" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">function problem by casting it in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">light of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">function of consciousness comes through</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">what does it generate it generates</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the nature problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">uh and i&#39;m very happy for people to take</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">me to task here it&#39;s highly speculative</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">but what does it generate it generates</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">real relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">uh religio religio is how we express</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:21.119" style="s2">spirituality and so all we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.760" style="s2">is jump from the dualistic mind body</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.119" end="00:58:24.720" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.760" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">smash it all together by adopting</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.720" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">relevance realization model of</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">i&#39;m still coming across</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:52.319" style="s2">yeah what came through</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.000" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">what do you think&#39;s drew and i know</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">you&#39;re yeah go ahead sorry mama</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">well i was just gonna say that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">statement you can easily reply</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">to right oh yeah that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:08.960" style="s2">the difference between kind of stunned</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">silence and this thing is bloody kicking</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.960" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">me off again i can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">yeah i know i sorry i kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">distracted by dog jumping on my lap so i</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t catch all of that i apologize</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">oh that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">sorry stuart and i am actually very</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">interested in your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">short story is my speculation is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:50.799" style="s2">don will</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">smash the problems which fall out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.799" end="00:59:54.799" style="s2">dualism which are the function problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">and the nature problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.799" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">by bringing it back to the function</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">of consciousness is relevance</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">realization the generation</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">of consciousness is primordially</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:12.319" style="s2">religio religio is the necessary</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">outworking of our spirituality we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.319" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">avoid it</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">therefore uh adopt relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.359" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">model for consciousness that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">guessing he&#39;s going to go for just just</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">before spirituality what did you say</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:34.079" style="s2">i i think before that i said uh that</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">he&#39;s going to talk about the nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.079" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">problem and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">function problem and so and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:41.599" style="s2">said the question probably and you said</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">the nature but i didn&#39;t quite catch that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.599" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">part so can you repeat that for me</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">he he coordinates the word</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:50.640" style="s2">nature problem with generation problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.640" end="01:00:54.079" style="s2">he&#39;s interchanging those two so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">sort of indicating</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.079" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">generation and religion well</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">to answer the question uh first of all i</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.200" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">am going to propose that what he does is</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">he&#39;s going to say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:11.119" style="s2">the function of consciousness is to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">relevance realization the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.119" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">thing which consciousness generates is</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:18.480" style="s2">religio</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">and religio is because it&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.480" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">being a cognitive agent</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t avoid it it is the house</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:30.559" style="s2">if you will for our spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">did that well so if i understand you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.559" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">correctly you&#39;re kind of saying that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">consciousness generates religion like</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">structurally how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">yeah yeah i think i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">yeah yeah i mean did you say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">i can enter i don&#39;t know if aveki will</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.520" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">go down that path um</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting idea uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.119" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.319" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">let&#39;s invert it</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">how would you invert it then well</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:22.240" style="s2">the the act of social behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">and having a dynamical relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.240" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">will generate consciousness right like</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">no well it depends i don&#39;t think viveke</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.599" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">would say that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:37.599" style="s2">like it sounds to me like you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:37.599" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.760" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know like the but just</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">religious ideas</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">especially well the question would be is</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">like how</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">is it it implies that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:09.839" style="s2">consciousness and connectedness</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">but there is a some kind of identity</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.839" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">relationship between them</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">in a deep sense you say that last part</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">again screw in please</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">uh there&#39;s like a kind of a sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">identity relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:25.680" style="s2">consciousness and connectedness because</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.680" end="01:03:29.440" style="s2">is like the it&#39;s the the ligaments that</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">bind right</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.440" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">so the ligaments that blinded like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">joinings</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">and so like consciousness what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:37.680" style="s2">saying is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">the degeneration of consciousness its</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.680" end="01:03:44.079" style="s2">fundamental structure</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:44.079" style="s2">is um is this joining</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:52.000" style="s2">yes that&#39;s very good when i&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:54.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.000" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">pan psychicism i&#39;ve thought that it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.400" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">would have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.280" end="01:03:59.680" style="s2">in the interactions where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:04:01.599" style="s2">consciousness is happening</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.680" end="01:04:03.119" style="s2">like the interactions of matter rather</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">than the matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.119" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">necessarily so the relations in other</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">words yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:14.720" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s spot on the last kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">is drawing please go ahead yeah no</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.720" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">i was just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.240" end="01:04:21.359" style="s2">say that the bindings and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.680" end="01:04:23.839" style="s2">connections and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.359" end="01:04:24.839" style="s2">the relatedness i mean those are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.839" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">obvious</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.839" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">thoughts at least conceptually</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:35.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m gonna like blast this open so</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">i think right like what your</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">brain does is is necessarily imitation</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">not relation but</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.599" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">sorry um with</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">with the imitation</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:09.359" style="s2">it it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">using an existing structure right so</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.359" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:17.200" style="s2">there&#39;s also a historical component</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">that&#39;s limiting the imitation</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.200" end="01:05:21.599" style="s2">and and in a sense what you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">necessarily is is</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.599" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">is a reduced model</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">of what is outside</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:35.280" style="s2">um and that&#39;s necessary dynamic because</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">it always gets updated</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.280" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">like at least that&#39;s where my thought is</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:40.079" style="s2">going about</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:43.200" style="s2">what what consciousness is right like so</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.079" end="01:05:46.319" style="s2">the consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.200" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">maybe another world projected by this</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.319" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">world or something</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">what my thinking is that so so what i</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">sort of getting at is that consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">seems to happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">when your neurons are interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:02.000" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:04.640" style="s2">so they&#39;re having a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.000" end="01:06:07.039" style="s2">each other so all your thoughts are</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.640" end="01:06:08.160" style="s2">aren&#39;t just any particular neuron doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.039" end="01:06:10.799" style="s2">something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.160" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">neurons it&#39;s the relationships that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.799" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">happening between the firing of</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">certain neurons and also</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:26.000" style="s2">um the sorry just one more thing it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:26.000" style="s2">i would say that imitation</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:32.400" style="s2">is gonna have some thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">in there about relating to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.400" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.520" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">but godzilla okay so it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">like um regardless of what the content</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">john&#39;s discussion about consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">that the problem of consciousness is in</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.839" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">fact relevant to retina</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:06:59.920" style="s2">so we&#39;re we&#39;re basically all going on</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:01.760" style="s2">okay so with</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.920" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">conscious i think consciousness is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.760" end="01:07:05.039" style="s2">i think consciousness is this but</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">basically what it&#39;s coming down to</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.039" end="01:07:10.400" style="s2">is um that uh yes um</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:12.839" style="s2">the problem of consciousness is relevant</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.400" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">to what we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.839" end="01:07:18.799" style="s2">um no no but</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:19.680" style="s2">i i that that&#39;s the question like it</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.799" end="01:07:23.039" style="s2">could just be a</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.680" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">uh a rabbit hole that we go that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.039" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">all gone down that actually serves no</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">and that actually the solution or the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:31.119" style="s2">problem we&#39;re facing is something</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:32.640" style="s2">completely unrelated to the hard problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.119" end="01:07:34.480" style="s2">of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.640" end="01:07:36.559" style="s2">all right in that case i&#39;ll point out</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.480" end="01:07:40.640" style="s2">that um consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.559" end="01:07:44.559" style="s2">is how we experience the world and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.640" end="01:07:47.280" style="s2">um if um how we experience the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.559" end="01:07:48.160" style="s2">and why we experience the world is going</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.280" end="01:07:52.799" style="s2">to affect</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.160" end="01:07:52.799" style="s2">um how what we feel is meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.680" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">therefore learning but we don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.079" end="01:08:00.960" style="s2">theory of consciousness for that</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.839" end="01:08:02.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s okay but if you it but</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.960" end="01:08:04.000" style="s2">learning about why you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.640" end="01:08:06.400" style="s2">consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.000" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">how you have consciousness will affect</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.400" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">um what you feel is meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:15.760" style="s2">um so that&#39;s uh like</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.880" end="01:08:16.400" style="s2">um consciousness is how you experience</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.760" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">if you if you um meditate and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:25.279" style="s2">experiencing the world differently</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:26.560" style="s2">then that affects how you see things and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.279" end="01:08:29.679" style="s2">that&#39;s going to affect</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.560" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">um your sense of meaning yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.679" end="01:08:34.719" style="s2">right but that&#39;s already true without</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:37.199" style="s2">knowing what consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.719" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s no it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:40.159" style="s2">why you have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:42.000" style="s2">say any of that and the hard problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.159" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">conscious together</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.000" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">like that could be completely unrelated</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:50.640" style="s2">it could be completely unrelated but um</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:52.640" style="s2">if we have a if we can get a better idea</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.640" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">a better grasp of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.640" end="01:08:56.640" style="s2">how and why we experience consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.640" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">affect the problem formulation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">going to affect the solutions that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">available to us</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">yes but okay so there is the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">the hard problem of consciousness right</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">so there&#39;s a problem i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">much effort we actually have to expand</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">and what it will take to get the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:19.440" style="s2">because so well it&#39;s a high problem so</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:20.799" style="s2">uh maybe there will never be a solution</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.440" end="01:09:23.120" style="s2">to that problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.799" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">yeah but any information we have towards</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.120" end="01:09:28.000" style="s2">that is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:29.920" style="s2">um useful no because</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.000" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be useful right like</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.920" end="01:09:33.600" style="s2">this is this is the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.440" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">information right like</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.600" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">if if you relate to the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">the useful things are the things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">optimize your relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">like me and mark were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">post-modernism for example and nihilism</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.120" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">they&#39;re like like black holes right like</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">they&#39;re like pits that just suck you in</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:59.040" style="s2">and and they&#39;re not productive right so</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">engaging with those ideas is just</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.040" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">not gonna resolve anything it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:05.040" style="s2">going to bring</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">any fruit right it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.040" end="01:10:07.600" style="s2">sow</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:08.640" style="s2">any fields it&#39;s just going to suck</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.600" end="01:10:13.600" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.640" end="01:10:13.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s it it is not clear to me that</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.480" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">dealing with consciousness is is</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">fruitful</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">in in a pragmatic sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:26.560" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with consciousness now</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">the way you experience the world is</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.560" end="01:10:30.480" style="s2">through consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">yes but i i have ways of dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.480" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">consciousness without knowing the true</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">nature of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:39.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you don&#39;t actually need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">know how your car works to use your car</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.040" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">like you don&#39;t learn how cars well yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">but if you know how your car</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">works then you can solve problems</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:49.440" style="s2">related to</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:51.360" style="s2">your car better we are talking about um</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.440" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">demeaning crisis which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.360" end="01:10:55.440" style="s2">a problem that the consciousness has</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">with a lot with a lack of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.440" end="01:10:59.920" style="s2">right right okay so i think head doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:01.040" style="s2">care that there&#39;s no meaning</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.920" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2">right but i think i can make the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.040" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">metaphor meaningful here by saying</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s not clear that knowing exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">how the car works is going to tell you</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">where you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:15.600" style="s2">like that that it&#39;s not obvious at least</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">if if that is the claim that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.600" end="01:11:19.520" style="s2">make or that anyone wants to make</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:21.600" style="s2">i think an argument needs to be made in</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.520" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">favor of you can&#39;t just assume that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.600" end="01:11:24.159" style="s2">is the case that</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">once you know how the car works you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">going to know where you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:30.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not arguing that you all know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">arguing</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.960" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">that this is information that affects</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">how you think about things</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:41.440" style="s2">and if you and um the meaning crisis is</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:42.880" style="s2">a problem with how you think about</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.440" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.880" end="01:11:45.920" style="s2">right but more information is not always</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:49.040" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.920" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">like this is relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:53.120" style="s2">right it could be like you could be at</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.679" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">the tech</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.120" end="01:11:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying let&#39;s do some research</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:58.560" style="s2">i&#39;m saying let&#39;s listen to the research</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.280" end="01:12:02.080" style="s2">that johns of 80</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.560" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">is doing and is making videos about</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.080" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not dealing with the point</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:12.560" style="s2">right like when</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:15.760" style="s2">when your your conception of self</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.560" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">gets more complex you have more</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">variables to relate to</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:23.360" style="s2">that means your</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">your road is going to be more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.360" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">because you&#39;re you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">have to deal with okay but on the other</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">hand you&#39;re not dealing with an overly</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:34.000" style="s2">simplified version of self</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:35.760" style="s2">if the self is too it is too complex</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.000" end="01:12:37.520" style="s2">then you can&#39;t solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.760" end="01:12:39.120" style="s2">if the thought the self is too</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.520" end="01:12:41.600" style="s2">simplified then the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.120" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.600" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">it seems like there&#39;s an equivocation</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.000" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">confusing this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:57.199" style="s2">between like</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.030" end="01:13:00.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.199" end="01:13:01.520" style="s2">like having a fact known by a field</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">versus</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.520" end="01:13:08.719" style="s2">um like actively</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">uh applying a fact in your life</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.719" end="01:13:13.679" style="s2">when john and greg try to solve the hard</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:16.159" style="s2">problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.679" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">they&#39;re not trying to make you study the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.159" end="01:13:19.199" style="s2">hard problem of consciousness they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.199" end="01:13:22.719" style="s2">solve it to see to see what does come</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.159" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">out of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.719" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">and i think like the field</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:29.280" style="s2">exploring things adjacent to the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.280" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">um is definitely a different</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:38.239" style="s2">program to the program of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.560" end="01:13:39.840" style="s2">working out what individuals should do</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.239" end="01:13:42.560" style="s2">within the meaning crisis but</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:44.560" style="s2">um there&#39;s a higher order relation</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.560" end="01:13:48.239" style="s2">between those two</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.560" end="01:13:48.239" style="s2">helps resolve this conflict</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:56.880" style="s2">so my takeaway from the two videos with</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:59.280" style="s2">between john and greg was not that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.880" end="01:14:01.360" style="s2">they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.280" end="01:14:02.800" style="s2">the value doesn&#39;t come from actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.360" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">solving the problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.800" end="01:14:08.239" style="s2">of consciousness but from reframing</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:10.080" style="s2">how we think about problem of</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.239" end="01:14:11.840" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:13.199" style="s2">and for most people it&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.840" end="01:14:16.320" style="s2">reframing</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.199" end="01:14:17.760" style="s2">of the problem that actually brings</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.320" end="01:14:20.159" style="s2">value to their lives</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.760" end="01:14:21.840" style="s2">and i think i agree with people who say</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.159" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">who say just having</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.840" end="01:14:25.600" style="s2">the information more information isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">necessarily going to help</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.600" end="01:14:30.960" style="s2">although i also agree that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:35.679" style="s2">information will have an effect</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.960" end="01:14:35.679" style="s2">but i think the important part</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.840" end="01:14:42.640" style="s2">for actually where retinal fits in</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.400" end="01:14:44.239" style="s2">is that i think retina is going to have</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.640" end="01:14:47.600" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.239" end="01:14:50.640" style="s2">provide a reframing of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.600" end="01:14:55.440" style="s2">of of the seeming duality between</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.640" end="01:14:55.440" style="s2">consciousness and physical material</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.520" end="01:15:01.360" style="s2">whether reality not it actually solves</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.800" end="01:15:04.400" style="s2">it yes it sort of occurred to me that uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.360" end="01:15:10.800" style="s2">it might be part of how</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.400" end="01:15:13.679" style="s2">re-homing us in the world maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.800" end="01:15:14.960" style="s2">where it might be part of a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.679" end="01:15:18.239" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.960" end="01:15:18.239" style="s2">at some time but</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.920" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d say it&#39;s also uh the process um</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.400" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">metaphor or relation giving rise to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.440" end="01:15:31.840" style="s2">is analogous to transactivity being more</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.480" end="01:15:35.440" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.840" end="01:15:36.480" style="s2">than the the schizophrenic split between</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.440" end="01:15:39.040" style="s2">subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.480" end="01:15:40.880" style="s2">objectivity that john often talks about</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.040" end="01:15:41.440" style="s2">and that could fit into the narrative as</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.880" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.440" end="01:15:45.360" style="s2">and i think he&#39;s also trying to break</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">down the simple dichotomy with</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.360" end="01:15:50.719" style="s2">uh the help of greg having like the four</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.480" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">or three or four different kinds of mind</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.719" end="01:15:55.679" style="s2">like the self-conscious phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:59.040" style="s2">and then the self-justification system</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.679" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">in order to problematize</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.040" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">the idea of just consciousness being one</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.840" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.560" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">uh when you say consciousness just being</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.640" end="01:16:20.159" style="s2">one thing can you elaborate slightly</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:21.920" style="s2">what you mean by that idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.159" end="01:16:23.679" style="s2">yeah so i feel like most people have the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.920" end="01:16:27.199" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.679" end="01:16:29.280" style="s2">um i presumably from from descartes</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.199" end="01:16:32.080" style="s2">where it&#39;s their uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.280" end="01:16:33.199" style="s2">sense of ability to think and direct</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.080" end="01:16:35.360" style="s2">their attention or some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.199" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">combination of all those things whereas</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.360" end="01:16:39.360" style="s2">greg&#39;s model uh differentiated between</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.159" end="01:16:41.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.360" end="01:16:43.600" style="s2">um i can pose a picture but he had a</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.760" end="01:16:45.440" style="s2">nice picture of the the lower</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.600" end="01:16:47.440" style="s2">left section of the internal state of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.440" end="01:16:49.440" style="s2">like a different loops of</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.440" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">information process thing and then one</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.440" end="01:16:54.239" style="s2">higher which was</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">uh a recursive sense of uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.239" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">phenomenal self and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:01.280" style="s2">yeah so you basically mean the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.760" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">the mind is complex</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.280" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">not simple</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.480" end="01:17:08.000" style="s2">the the lower one that i just mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.239" end="01:17:09.360" style="s2">like component processing no no i mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.000" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">in general like the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.360" end="01:17:13.199" style="s2">mind is simple</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:14.719" style="s2">not complex it&#39;s like if your mind is</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.199" end="01:17:16.480" style="s2">complex and there&#39;s many parts working</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.719" end="01:17:18.960" style="s2">together if it&#39;s simple then that</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.480" end="01:17:20.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t really any part just the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.960" end="01:17:21.760" style="s2">like people</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.000" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2">the simple view of consciousness is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.760" end="01:17:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just this kind of self-contained</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:28.800" style="s2">hole</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.520" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">yeah and i think that that&#39;s related to</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.800" end="01:17:32.239" style="s2">john&#39;s critiques of like the simple</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.199" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.239" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">of pansexism as well versus deep</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:38.960" style="s2">continuity</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:41.199" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.960" end="01:17:42.880" style="s2">solve the hard problem at least</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.199" end="01:17:44.719" style="s2">from what they&#39;ve said but try to like</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.880" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">circle it and make it smaller</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.719" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">as far as i understood</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">well fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.320" end="01:18:00.159" style="s2">but yeah i liked the idea of religio</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">giving rise to consciousness rather than</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.159" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">vice versa since that would kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:05.600" style="s2">relate to the idea of transactivity</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:07.679" style="s2">being the locus of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.600" end="01:18:09.679" style="s2">and maybe consciousness being like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:12.560" style="s2">ground of meaning in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.679" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">rather than the cartesian dualism having</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.560" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.960" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">the relation between things uh huffman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.239" end="01:18:22.159" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:24.560" style="s2">um like uh well that reality is an</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.159" end="01:18:24.560" style="s2">illusion</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">um that that matter is</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">is is a derivative of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:35.040" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s like uh how does he</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.440" end="01:18:37.760" style="s2">put it</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.040" end="01:18:39.440" style="s2">the the matter is is basically something</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.760" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">that your your consciousness interface</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.440" end="01:18:43.040" style="s2">generates in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:44.960" style="s2">interact with the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.040" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">like so the consciousness is logically</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.960" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">prior to the matter</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.159" end="01:18:52.719" style="s2">yeah i mean there&#39;s like the less</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.960" end="01:18:53.199" style="s2">radical interpretation of that which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.719" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.199" end="01:18:56.880" style="s2">cons that everything is filtered through</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:18:59.600" style="s2">our evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.880" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">derived senses but then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.600" end="01:19:02.159" style="s2">maybe the more</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:04.960" style="s2">extreme version of that which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.159" end="01:19:07.040" style="s2">something like uh whitehead&#39;s idea that</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:08.480" style="s2">uh process or the field is more</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.040" end="01:19:10.480" style="s2">fundamental than the particles</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.480" end="01:19:13.679" style="s2">themselves which is i assume what</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.480" end="01:19:13.679" style="s2">hoffman&#39;s getting at kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.760" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">um no i mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.440" end="01:19:23.920" style="s2">um hoffman&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:27.520" style="s2">but what i understand it&#39;s like he uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.920" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">hoffman has his own way of talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.520" end="01:19:30.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.080" end="01:19:32.719" style="s2">the process and the the and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.960" end="01:19:35.280" style="s2">substance</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.719" end="01:19:37.520" style="s2">um like he has them both he&#39;s not he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.280" end="01:19:42.239" style="s2">not trying to to shift off of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.520" end="01:19:42.239" style="s2">the substance into process he&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.480" end="01:19:46.400" style="s2">well he&#39;s he i don&#39;t know he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">speculative in the way that he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.400" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of like well yeah my ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:52.080" style="s2">very daring but they specific and they</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:53.520" style="s2">testable and that&#39;s good science yada</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:55.520" style="s2">yada yada right so he</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.520" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">he he knows that he&#39;s making provocative</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.520" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">statements right</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">so but from what i understand is like</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.159" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">his idea of</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.760" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">like he&#39;s literally trying to reverse</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.440" end="01:20:13.360" style="s2">the idea of of</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:14.639" style="s2">um because most people physicalist or</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.360" end="01:20:16.560" style="s2">whatever they think okay you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.639" end="01:20:18.320" style="s2">physics and then physics somehow gives</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.560" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2">rise to conscious</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.320" end="01:20:21.600" style="s2">he inverts that he says okay you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.920" end="01:20:22.480" style="s2">consciousness and then it somehow gives</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.600" end="01:20:24.080" style="s2">rise to physic</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.480" end="01:20:25.840" style="s2">like he&#39;s he&#39;s explicitly trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.080" end="01:20:27.600" style="s2">that argument and</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.840" end="01:20:30.080" style="s2">well i mean he might be wrong but but</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.600" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting way of looking</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.080" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">so i mean i really like often</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.000" end="01:20:40.400" style="s2">like yeah i just definitely noticed</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.360" end="01:20:41.280" style="s2">that yeah i mean i i enjoyed them as</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.400" end="01:20:44.960" style="s2">well but like</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.280" end="01:20:46.719" style="s2">um yeah well hoffman is just</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.960" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.719" end="01:20:50.400" style="s2">really elegant about the way he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.840" end="01:20:56.560" style="s2">yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.280" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">but i&#39;m not too yeah i know greg greg</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.040" end="01:21:03.920" style="s2">and john also well i don&#39;t know greg</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:06.239" style="s2">that well yet i like quite a couple</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.920" end="01:21:06.239" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:13.280" style="s2">john i like his dis like</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.840" end="01:21:14.960" style="s2">this strikes me as a really disappointed</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">more like that that&#39;s his most</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.960" end="01:21:18.000" style="s2">exceptional</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:21.360" style="s2">feature i would say in terms of his</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.000" end="01:21:24.880" style="s2">thinking the discipline</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:27.679" style="s2">and you know i kind of learned</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.880" end="01:21:29.360" style="s2">yeah i learned about why i think i</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.679" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">learned the value of that</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.360" end="01:21:34.000" style="s2">like at least the value of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:34.000" style="s2">emulate</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.600" end="01:21:41.040" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d say humility as well in my</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.480" end="01:21:41.040" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.360" end="01:21:46.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a dirty word</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.410" end="01:21:49.040" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.800" end="01:21:50.560" style="s2">that might be an interesting discussion</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.040" end="01:21:54.080" style="s2">uh weren&#39;t we kind of connecting</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.560" end="01:21:54.080" style="s2">humility to reverence earlier</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.639" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.320" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">i mean i i can i don&#39;t know i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.199" end="01:22:03.440" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:05.520" style="s2">there&#39;s an equivocation going on because</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.440" end="01:22:07.600" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.520" end="01:22:10.080" style="s2">there&#39;s humility versus pride and</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.600" end="01:22:13.120" style="s2">humility versus hubris almost right</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.080" end="01:22:15.040" style="s2">and like humility pride is</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.120" end="01:22:16.159" style="s2">always well not always but it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.040" end="01:22:18.239" style="s2">seen as</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.159" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">bad no matter what right but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.239" end="01:22:20.960" style="s2">there&#39;s such a thing as taking pride in</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:23.679" style="s2">your work</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.960" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">and so there&#39;s like a i don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.679" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.520" end="01:22:31.520" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the misuse of the word</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.120" end="01:22:31.520" style="s2">pride</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.159" end="01:22:35.840" style="s2">no i don&#39;t think so because i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.639" end="01:22:37.280" style="s2">such a thing as taking</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.840" end="01:22:39.440" style="s2">pride in your work and being proud of</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.280" end="01:22:40.880" style="s2">who you are and and being willing to</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.440" end="01:22:44.800" style="s2">stand up for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.880" end="01:22:45.520" style="s2">and like you can&#39;t you can&#39;t just think</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.800" end="01:22:47.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.520" end="01:22:49.120" style="s2">the biggest in life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.440" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.120" end="01:22:52.639" style="s2">there comes a point where humility is no</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:56.080" style="s2">longer honest</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.639" end="01:22:57.360" style="s2">and like no you know if if you are the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.080" end="01:22:58.400" style="s2">best in the world it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.360" end="01:23:01.040" style="s2">you should be proud</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.400" end="01:23:01.600" style="s2">like you did something that that is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.040" end="01:23:03.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.600" end="01:23:04.960" style="s2">noteworthy like you&#39;re better than</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.679" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">everybody else even if it&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.960" end="01:23:07.600" style="s2">thing that like there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.000" end="01:23:09.199" style="s2">other things with people better other</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.600" end="01:23:10.560" style="s2">than you acting right the one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.199" end="01:23:11.760" style="s2">you did that that&#39;s significant</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.560" end="01:23:14.159" style="s2">it should be recognized and you should</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.760" end="01:23:17.840" style="s2">be able to say if it&#39;s honest if</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.159" end="01:23:19.360" style="s2">if you actually have the the these</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.840" end="01:23:21.040" style="s2">results to back it up it&#39;s like well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.360" end="01:23:24.880" style="s2">the best in the world</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.040" end="01:23:28.719" style="s2">so i i think i&#39;ve resolved this issue</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.880" end="01:23:32.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s a distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.719" end="01:23:35.440" style="s2">an act of will and an act of</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.400" end="01:23:38.080" style="s2">agency right and then in in some</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.440" end="01:23:39.040" style="s2">sense you you&#39;re not responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.080" end="01:23:42.320" style="s2">your capacity</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.040" end="01:23:44.960" style="s2">right like the the capacities</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.320" end="01:23:46.840" style="s2">are just there they&#39;re available to you</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.960" end="01:23:49.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.840" end="01:23:50.560" style="s2">taking pride in that or whatever i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.679" end="01:23:54.880" style="s2">is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.560" end="01:23:58.560" style="s2">right but when when</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.880" end="01:24:02.159" style="s2">when you&#39;re you&#39;re struggling right and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.560" end="01:24:03.040" style="s2">and you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re having an act</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.159" end="01:24:05.760" style="s2">of will</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.040" end="01:24:06.159" style="s2">right like maybe taking pride in that</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.760" end="01:24:07.679" style="s2">but i</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.159" end="01:24:09.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i want to use the word</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.679" end="01:24:13.920" style="s2">pride there but</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.440" end="01:24:17.520" style="s2">but at least respect for for that</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.920" end="01:24:21.280" style="s2">is is important i also like</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.520" end="01:24:24.400" style="s2">to i like to define the</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.280" end="01:24:26.480" style="s2">i like i like having two words</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.400" end="01:24:28.320" style="s2">no i&#39;ve noticed that we often use two</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.480" end="01:24:29.840" style="s2">words for the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.320" end="01:24:32.239" style="s2">virtue if you&#39;re thinking about it in</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.840" end="01:24:33.520" style="s2">aristotelian terms so humility is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.239" end="01:24:37.920" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.520" end="01:24:41.120" style="s2">relative to hubris or arrogance</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.920" end="01:24:45.040" style="s2">but obviously there&#39;s the other pole of</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.120" end="01:24:46.560" style="s2">basically hating yourself and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.040" end="01:24:49.120" style="s2">relative to that you might say</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.560" end="01:24:52.159" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.120" end="01:24:54.080" style="s2">so like i understand self-respect yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.159" end="01:24:56.560" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.080" end="01:24:57.520" style="s2">well to to speak to manuel&#39;s example</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.560" end="01:24:58.960" style="s2">first of all i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.520" end="01:25:00.639" style="s2">buy the distinction between will and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.960" end="01:25:02.960" style="s2">agents i mean that like what are you</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.639" end="01:25:05.840" style="s2">even talking about but aside from that</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.960" end="01:25:07.199" style="s2">um it&#39;s like okay you are born with</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.840" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say the best abilities in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.199" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">world you say it&#39;s wrong to take pride</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:10.719" style="s2">in it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">well if you don&#39;t take pride in it will</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.719" end="01:25:14.480" style="s2">you actually make the best and</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:16.239" style="s2">my answer would be no it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.480" end="01:25:18.560" style="s2">pride is the price you have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.239" end="01:25:19.600" style="s2">in order to to bring it out the best</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.560" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">that is possible</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.600" end="01:25:22.800" style="s2">of that talent or that natural ability</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.280" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re making like</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.800" end="01:25:28.000" style="s2">50 assumptions there that i all disagree</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:30.320" style="s2">with probably</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.000" end="01:25:31.120" style="s2">why why would you have to make the best</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.320" end="01:25:34.159" style="s2">of that skill</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.120" end="01:25:36.159" style="s2">like that&#39;s not a given at all no</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.159" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re not taking</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.159" end="01:25:38.639" style="s2">advantage of whatever the natural</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:41.840" style="s2">capability is</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.639" end="01:25:41.840" style="s2">so if</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.760" end="01:25:55.840" style="s2">no i don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.960" end="01:25:57.440" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.840" end="01:25:59.440" style="s2">i think one of the distinctions i would</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.440" end="01:26:00.400" style="s2">make between pride and arrogance for</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.440" end="01:26:03.360" style="s2">example would be</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.400" end="01:26:03.760" style="s2">uh you can take pride in your own skill</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.360" end="01:26:06.480" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.760" end="01:26:07.040" style="s2">acknowledging the other factors that</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.480" end="01:26:09.600" style="s2">weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.040" end="01:26:10.320" style="s2">under your control that went into uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.600" end="01:26:11.920" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.320" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">capability to have that skill in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.920" end="01:26:16.880" style="s2">first place even if one of those</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.520" end="01:26:18.400" style="s2">is genes for example like john often</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.880" end="01:26:19.920" style="s2">citing other researchers that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.400" end="01:26:22.159" style="s2">collaborated with that</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.920" end="01:26:23.600" style="s2">you know or people that you&#39;ve stood on</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.159" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">the shoulders of that have written</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.600" end="01:26:28.560" style="s2">previous topics before you without</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:32.000" style="s2">self-effacing your accomplishment</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.560" end="01:26:35.199" style="s2">i think it yeah i think it&#39;s as simple</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.000" end="01:26:37.120" style="s2">as you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.199" end="01:26:38.800" style="s2">call it a virtue to recognize your</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.120" end="01:26:42.080" style="s2">limits</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.800" end="01:26:42.560" style="s2">you also need to recognize your power</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.080" end="01:26:45.280" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.560" end="01:26:45.280" style="s2">capacities</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.600" end="01:26:50.000" style="s2">yeah well here&#39;s a practical example as</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.719" end="01:26:51.679" style="s2">if you become a heart surgeon</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:53.120" style="s2">you&#39;re the best you know like taking</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.679" end="01:26:55.120" style="s2">pride in your abilities of the heart</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.120" end="01:26:57.679" style="s2">surgeon like your manual dexterity</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.120" end="01:26:59.520" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a natural-born talent the</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.679" end="01:27:00.639" style="s2">the taking the pride in it is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.520" end="01:27:02.400" style="s2">going to make you practice</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.639" end="01:27:04.000" style="s2">is what&#39;s going to make you actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.400" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">want to be the best is going to want to</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.000" end="01:27:06.080" style="s2">make you put in the effort to be the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:07.520" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.080" end="01:27:10.239" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t take pride in it you</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.520" end="01:27:11.920" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do that so</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.239" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily want everybody to</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.920" end="01:27:14.960" style="s2">think you want to try to become a heart</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:16.800" style="s2">surgeon</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.960" end="01:27:18.400" style="s2">but insofar as there is such a thing as</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:20.400" style="s2">a good heart surgeon</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.400" end="01:27:22.960" style="s2">you the the best heart surgeons will be</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.400" end="01:27:25.120" style="s2">the ones who take pride in heart surgery</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.960" end="01:27:26.639" style="s2">in their heart or their their capacity</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.120" end="01:27:28.719" style="s2">for heart surgery</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.639" end="01:27:30.560" style="s2">those that don&#39;t probably will neglect</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.719" end="01:27:32.960" style="s2">their art in some respect because they</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.560" end="01:27:35.679" style="s2">don&#39;t take it serious</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.960" end="01:27:35.679" style="s2">that&#39;s my point</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.960" end="01:27:44.480" style="s2">and as i&#39;m saying like i mean obviously</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.239" end="01:27:45.920" style="s2">somebody can go and like you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.480" end="01:27:47.760" style="s2">the best heart surgeon therefore you</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.920" end="01:27:49.440" style="s2">know you should kiss my my shoe</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.760" end="01:27:50.960" style="s2">my shoes every morning when i wake up</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.440" end="01:27:52.400" style="s2">you know that that would obviously be</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.960" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">taking something too far that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.400" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite what i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.320" end="01:28:00.239" style="s2">yeah i agree it&#39;s one factor that would</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.880" end="01:28:03.440" style="s2">push people um</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.239" end="01:28:05.760" style="s2">to like get to the the top of their</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.440" end="01:28:07.040" style="s2">of their capacities although i wonder</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.760" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">whether uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.040" end="01:28:10.480" style="s2">it&#39;s possible for someone to have the</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:13.280" style="s2">like the locus of</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.480" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">itself that that john talks about um</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.280" end="01:28:16.560" style="s2">like getting rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:18.159" style="s2">like the self the self-conscious</p>

<p begin="01:28:18.159" end="01:28:22.239" style="s2">in the flow states um but you&#39;d still</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.719" end="01:28:23.760" style="s2">have pride after</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.239" end="01:28:25.920" style="s2">after the fact i guess is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.760" end="01:28:27.920" style="s2">saying to want to push you to</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.920" end="01:28:30.080" style="s2">to get into that state again even better</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.920" end="01:28:31.760" style="s2">in your craft</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.080" end="01:28:33.920" style="s2">yeah well i mean i i could i could</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.760" end="01:28:36.480" style="s2">certainly see how somebody</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.920" end="01:28:38.239" style="s2">uh who had a natural ability for</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.480" end="01:28:40.000" style="s2">something became narcissistic and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.239" end="01:28:41.440" style="s2">because of their narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.000" end="01:28:42.880" style="s2">you know they they&#39;re sitting there in</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.440" end="01:28:44.400" style="s2">the operating table and they think oh</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.880" end="01:28:45.920" style="s2">i&#39;m such a great heart surgeon you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.400" end="01:28:47.280" style="s2">look at me</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.920" end="01:28:48.960" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re busy like</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.280" end="01:28:49.760" style="s2">perforating the guy&#39;s hearts in their</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.960" end="01:28:52.400" style="s2">different places</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.760" end="01:28:53.679" style="s2">because they aren&#39;t doing i could see</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.400" end="01:28:56.960" style="s2">that as well</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.679" end="01:28:58.880" style="s2">so i i think my objection to</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.960" end="01:29:01.360" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do strong is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.880" end="01:29:03.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole set of other virtues who</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.360" end="01:29:04.400" style="s2">can also be used to explain that</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.199" end="01:29:07.440" style="s2">behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.400" end="01:29:10.719" style="s2">contextualize it and i don&#39;t see why</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.440" end="01:29:11.520" style="s2">you would focus on pride as a primary</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.719" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">way of</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.520" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">analyzing that situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.040" end="01:29:23.120" style="s2">well that&#39;s just the word that comes to</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.880" end="01:29:23.120" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.440" end="01:29:27.600" style="s2">yeah like i think it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.880" end="01:29:29.679" style="s2">possible motivations but they may also</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.600" end="01:29:30.719" style="s2">do it because they had you know someone</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.679" end="01:29:33.360" style="s2">else that they</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.719" end="01:29:34.719" style="s2">loved that died from having a poor</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.360" end="01:29:36.800" style="s2">surgery and they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.719" end="01:29:39.280" style="s2">kind of make up make it up to that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.800" end="01:29:42.000" style="s2">person so it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.280" end="01:29:42.719" style="s2">as you go like as maybe another person</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.000" end="01:29:44.800" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.719" end="01:29:46.239" style="s2">um but i&#39;m guessing you&#39;d think that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.800" end="01:29:49.040" style="s2">more motivation</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.239" end="01:29:51.199" style="s2">types maybe the the more likely they</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.040" end="01:29:54.639" style="s2">would be to be at the best of their</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:56.320" style="s2">skill yeah well i mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.639" end="01:29:59.120" style="s2">i if the only reason that people want to</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.320" end="01:30:01.679" style="s2">become heart surgeons like</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.120" end="01:30:03.360" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know i mean it&#39;s all well</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.679" end="01:30:05.120" style="s2">and good for somebody to have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.360" end="01:30:06.480" style="s2">family member who died tragically and</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.120" end="01:30:08.400" style="s2">then you know for that to serve as the</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.480" end="01:30:10.080" style="s2">inspiration for somebody to</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.400" end="01:30:13.040" style="s2">to never have somebody else suffer ever</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.080" end="01:30:14.320" style="s2">again but um</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.040" end="01:30:16.639" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if people are actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.320" end="01:30:18.639" style="s2">wired that way i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.639" end="01:30:22.480" style="s2">true of the average</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.639" end="01:30:25.679" style="s2">right but now</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.480" end="01:30:27.679" style="s2">we&#39;re in the realm of well necessary</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.679" end="01:30:30.719" style="s2">evil as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.679" end="01:30:30.719" style="s2">goodness right like</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.480" end="01:30:37.440" style="s2">okay well i&#39;m happy to argue that pride</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.560" end="01:30:37.440" style="s2">might be necessary</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.960" end="01:30:48.000" style="s2">it seems also like uh there might be</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.480" end="01:30:51.520" style="s2">a having mode thing here where</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.000" end="01:30:51.520" style="s2">like you&#39;re trying to describe a</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.840" end="01:30:56.400" style="s2">thing that might be called pride that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.800" end="01:30:58.960" style="s2">legitimate in the having mode</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.400" end="01:30:58.960" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.440" end="01:31:03.440" style="s2">uh reduce the number of people with</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.400" end="01:31:06.000" style="s2">heart problems</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.440" end="01:31:06.800" style="s2">and in order to do that i need to become</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.000" end="01:31:11.120" style="s2">superior</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.800" end="01:31:11.120" style="s2">in my ability to like</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.679" end="01:31:18.639" style="s2">whereas like this humility discussion is</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.639" end="01:31:21.840" style="s2">trying to solve a problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.639" end="01:31:23.679" style="s2">in the being mode and from that</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.840" end="01:31:25.040" style="s2">perspective i feel like you&#39;d want you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.679" end="01:31:27.679" style="s2">want both you just want them in their</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.040" end="01:31:27.679" style="s2">proper place</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.840" end="01:31:31.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.400" end="01:31:36.639" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i obviously take no pride in</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.880" end="01:31:38.159" style="s2">my ability to pay attention because i</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.639" end="01:31:38.639" style="s2">was laughing too much at the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.159" end="01:31:40.320" style="s2">you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.639" end="01:31:42.000" style="s2">continue bouncing out of the channel</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.320" end="01:31:44.080" style="s2">you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.000" end="01:31:45.679" style="s2">and i wanted to say something to you can</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.080" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">i say it now</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.679" end="01:31:52.480" style="s2">yeah yeah so i&#39;ve thought about this</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:53.520" style="s2">uh tension myself quite a bit and i</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.480" end="01:31:57.040" style="s2">think you&#39;d find it</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.520" end="01:31:59.520" style="s2">um helpful to do</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.040" end="01:32:01.040" style="s2">the dialogue between aristotle and</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.520" end="01:32:04.320" style="s2">aquinas</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.040" end="01:32:08.080" style="s2">on this very subject so</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.320" end="01:32:10.400" style="s2">in aristotle he pays no</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.080" end="01:32:12.000" style="s2">no mind to humility and i think the</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.400" end="01:32:14.880" style="s2">greeks in general</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.000" end="01:32:15.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t value it as a virtue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.880" end="01:32:18.400" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.679" end="01:32:20.719" style="s2">the exception that they were always on</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.400" end="01:32:25.440" style="s2">the lookout for hubris</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.719" end="01:32:28.320" style="s2">that being said aquinas</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.440" end="01:32:28.960" style="s2">did his summer theologica and he went</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.320" end="01:32:31.840" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.960" end="01:32:33.600" style="s2">as rigorously as you could possibly go</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.840" end="01:32:35.920" style="s2">and he kind of tempered</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.600" end="01:32:37.360" style="s2">so what you have in aristotle&#39;s virtues</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.920" end="01:32:39.520" style="s2">is magnaminity</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.360" end="01:32:42.000" style="s2">which i think literally translates as</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.520" end="01:32:44.880" style="s2">big solidness</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.000" end="01:32:45.360" style="s2">he or she who has a big soul and i think</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.880" end="01:32:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.360" end="01:32:50.320" style="s2">roughly translated to if you look into</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.000" end="01:32:53.520" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying he&#39;s saying it is good</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.320" end="01:32:54.080" style="s2">to be proud of your abilities and who</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.520" end="01:32:56.320" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.080" end="01:32:58.239" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s a virtue and that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.320" end="01:33:00.320" style="s2">strike christians</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.239" end="01:33:01.520" style="s2">well it struck it as a conflict which</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.320" end="01:33:03.920" style="s2">needed resolution</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.520" end="01:33:04.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s what aquinas set himself</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.920" end="01:33:07.600" style="s2">toward</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.560" end="01:33:09.920" style="s2">in the sumer i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.600" end="01:33:12.880" style="s2">remember i&#39;m sorry how he resolved it</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.920" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">but i think it was like basically</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.880" end="01:33:20.639" style="s2">something like the virtue of humility</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:23.679" style="s2">stops you from having</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.639" end="01:33:25.760" style="s2">the wrong impression of</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.679" end="01:33:27.360" style="s2">your abilities in other words it allows</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.760" end="01:33:29.600" style="s2">you to have the accurate</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.360" end="01:33:32.159" style="s2">assessment of what you are and what you</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.600" end="01:33:32.159" style="s2">can achieve</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.880" end="01:33:39.920" style="s2">well i i think there is such a thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.239" end="01:33:39.920" style="s2">as understanding a limitation</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.480" end="01:33:43.920" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think i</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.159" end="01:33:47.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.920" end="01:33:51.840" style="s2">want to endorse a sense of pride</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.280" end="01:33:51.840" style="s2">was not understanding</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.639" end="01:33:58.719" style="s2">that last part i say i wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.080" end="01:33:59.199" style="s2">endorse a sense of pride that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.719" end="01:34:02.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.199" end="01:34:04.880" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t mindful of your</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.840" end="01:34:06.239" style="s2">limitations yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.880" end="01:34:08.560" style="s2">because that wouldn&#39;t be skillful would</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.239" end="01:34:10.239" style="s2">it going to your doctor</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.560" end="01:34:11.920" style="s2">exactly like you wouldn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.239" end="01:34:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.920" end="01:34:15.679" style="s2">that&#39;s not the pride that gets you to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.440" end="01:34:17.120" style="s2">the best at what you are it&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.679" end="01:34:18.719" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.120" end="01:34:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not what you mean by when you when</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.719" end="01:34:21.760" style="s2">you try and take you know like if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.320" end="01:34:25.040" style="s2">take pride in your work</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.760" end="01:34:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that taking</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.040" end="01:34:29.520" style="s2">pride isn&#39;t is is also an awareness of</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.440" end="01:34:32.080" style="s2">your limitations</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.520" end="01:34:33.280" style="s2">yeah it really does like i really really</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.080" end="01:34:35.840" style="s2">do feel</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.280" end="01:34:37.679" style="s2">like probably the way that strewn&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.840" end="01:34:39.199" style="s2">saying the word pride i would prefer</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.679" end="01:34:41.199" style="s2">confidence but</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.199" end="01:34:43.440" style="s2">you know the way you&#39;re using the word</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.199" end="01:34:46.639" style="s2">yeah the way you&#39;re using the word pride</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.440" end="01:34:49.119" style="s2">is literally the virtue relative to</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.639" end="01:34:50.239" style="s2">the deficiency and humility is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.119" end="01:34:53.199" style="s2">virtue relative</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.239" end="01:34:56.159" style="s2">to the excess but they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.199" end="01:34:58.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about getting the right</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.159" end="01:35:01.840" style="s2">view of yourself and that involves</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.960" end="01:35:05.920" style="s2">knowing your limitations</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.840" end="01:35:10.639" style="s2">and knowing your capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.920" end="01:35:14.719" style="s2">i&#39;d put that under justice actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.639" end="01:35:18.639" style="s2">but that&#39;s can&#39;t wait i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.719" end="01:35:22.159" style="s2">well justice is having having the things</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.639" end="01:35:25.840" style="s2">be as they should right</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.159" end="01:35:28.960" style="s2">as in not too much not too little</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.840" end="01:35:29.679" style="s2">well yeah but also that things come to</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.960" end="01:35:31.920" style="s2">expression</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.679" end="01:35:32.719" style="s2">in the way they&#39;re supposed to come into</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.920" end="01:35:35.119" style="s2">expression</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.719" end="01:35:35.119" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.080" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">that that&#39;s the engine between your</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.760" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">actual age heritage their manual</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.560" end="01:35:50.639" style="s2">well yeah that that&#39;s that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.880" end="01:35:53.119" style="s2">hearing when you say pride is like</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.639" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">well do things as they&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.119" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">right like and then</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.639" end="01:36:07.440" style="s2">no i mean i think that they</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.679" end="01:36:09.199" style="s2">yeah i mean at least historically that</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.440" end="01:36:11.360" style="s2">was i think there&#39;s a lot of legitimacy</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.199" end="01:36:13.040" style="s2">to that that&#39;s how justice was seen</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.360" end="01:36:15.520" style="s2">at least in the good old you know the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.040" end="01:36:19.920" style="s2">like the ancient days not not the</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.520" end="01:36:24.639" style="s2">medieval or the one so you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.920" end="01:36:26.560" style="s2">yeah that sense my actual age robot</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.639" end="01:36:28.000" style="s2">are we still recording by the way if you</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.560" end="01:36:31.360" style="s2">stopped uh</p>

<p begin="01:36:38.480" end="01:36:41.119" style="s2">well include it</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.880" end="01:36:50.840" style="s2">can everybody get all self-conscious at</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.480" end="01:36:53.840" style="s2">once now</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.840" end="01:36:53.840" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.679" end="01:36:59.260" style="s2">yeah where&#39;s all that pride that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.280" end="01:37:04.610" style="s2">guys are speaking of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.260" end="01:37:04.610" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.040" end="01:37:09.600" style="s2">yeah you see this is this is i know what</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.960" end="01:37:09.600" style="s2">i lack so</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.239" end="01:37:18.880" style="s2">so going back to projects um</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.639" end="01:37:20.239" style="s2">fully caught up with the written our</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.880" end="01:37:22.800" style="s2">world i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.239" end="01:37:23.760" style="s2">like fully participating yet but i think</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.800" end="01:37:27.760" style="s2">like one thing</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.760" end="01:37:32.560" style="s2">on my mind looking forward is</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.760" end="01:37:35.119" style="s2">uh like a retina analog to</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.560" end="01:37:36.080" style="s2">and to like art that people participate</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.119" end="01:37:38.239" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.080" end="01:37:40.239" style="s2">uh sorry you cut out when you said the</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.239" end="01:37:43.840" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.239" end="01:37:47.280" style="s2">oh liturgy liturgical practice</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.840" end="01:37:50.239" style="s2">oh yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.280" end="01:37:50.239" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.360" end="01:37:55.199" style="s2">i think a lot about video game design</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.199" end="01:37:58.719" style="s2">which is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.199" end="01:38:02.480" style="s2">an abysmal uh mode of expression</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.719" end="01:38:04.800" style="s2">as it&#39;s currently used but um</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.480" end="01:38:06.159" style="s2">like that already has a participation</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.800" end="01:38:09.840" style="s2">built into it</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.159" end="01:38:14.000" style="s2">um but also like you know all of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.840" end="01:38:18.159" style="s2">existing art forms which um</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.000" end="01:38:20.080" style="s2">have a place in religious traditions</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.159" end="01:38:23.199" style="s2">uh but have like lost their religious</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.080" end="01:38:24.719" style="s2">connection in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.199" end="01:38:26.239" style="s2">it&#39;s something that i think deserves a</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.719" end="01:38:30.239" style="s2">lot of humility</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.239" end="01:38:32.560" style="s2">and like not</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.239" end="01:38:33.679" style="s2">not underestimating the the challenge of</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.560" end="01:38:36.320" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.679" end="01:38:39.280" style="s2">spiritually profound art but like i</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.320" end="01:38:42.960" style="s2">think that would be a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.280" end="01:38:45.199" style="s2">like long-term goal of retina</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.960" end="01:38:47.280" style="s2">i have actually been thinking about like</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.199" end="01:38:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the main way</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.280" end="01:38:53.679" style="s2">i think about uh when i&#39;m uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.480" end="01:38:56.400" style="s2">just you know just thinking</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.679" end="01:38:57.520" style="s2">thoughts for the fun of it i think about</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.400" end="01:39:01.119" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.520" end="01:39:04.960" style="s2">video games would be</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.119" end="01:39:06.960" style="s2">possibly a superior way of</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.960" end="01:39:09.040" style="s2">transmitting a myth because you are</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.960" end="01:39:13.440" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.040" end="01:39:16.320" style="s2">literally participating in it</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.440" end="01:39:18.400" style="s2">are you actually involved in the myth if</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.320" end="01:39:20.960" style="s2">you made a video game</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.400" end="01:39:22.560" style="s2">meant to transmit like a narrative or</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.960" end="01:39:25.920" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.560" end="01:39:28.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting so you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.920" end="01:39:31.520" style="s2">you&#39;re stepping on my project</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.800" end="01:39:32.000" style="s2">oops yeah but i i thought your games</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.520" end="01:39:35.440" style="s2">were like</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.000" end="01:39:38.239" style="s2"> uh d and d</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.440" end="01:39:39.199" style="s2">which is like imagining you well i</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.239" end="01:39:41.199" style="s2">mean like that</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.199" end="01:39:42.880" style="s2">haven&#39;t foreclosed on anything right and</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.199" end="01:39:46.400" style="s2">the idea is to make as many</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.880" end="01:39:48.480" style="s2">as possible but yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.400" end="01:39:50.639" style="s2">distinction that i&#39;d like to draw with</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.480" end="01:39:53.280" style="s2">the suggestion is that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.639" end="01:39:54.000" style="s2">want to look at them liturgy i want to</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.280" end="01:39:57.440" style="s2">look at them</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.000" end="01:40:01.600" style="s2">as tools</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.440" end="01:40:01.600" style="s2">for self-development</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.000" end="01:40:07.360" style="s2">and part of that would be a concept that</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.520" end="01:40:10.960" style="s2">we call historical grounding</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.360" end="01:40:12.400" style="s2">where you&#39;re contextualizing the</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.960" end="01:40:16.000" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.400" end="01:40:19.520" style="s2">of the person within themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.000" end="01:40:22.560" style="s2">their their direct history and their</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.520" end="01:40:24.000" style="s2">their more ancient history and and</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.560" end="01:40:28.560" style="s2">making that connection</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.000" end="01:40:31.679" style="s2">is something like narrative</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.560" end="01:40:34.719" style="s2">rising information</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.679" end="01:40:38.000" style="s2">in in a way that that</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.719" end="01:40:39.520" style="s2">that grounds that person in in at least</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.000" end="01:40:43.360" style="s2">in relationship to the game but</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.520" end="01:40:51.840" style="s2">uh hopefully in a more permanent way</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.360" end="01:40:51.840" style="s2">to do a meaningful thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.040" end="01:41:03.760" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s awesome i&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.040" end="01:41:04.560" style="s2">interested to see where that goes with</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.760" end="01:41:07.040" style="s2">both of you</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.560" end="01:41:08.000" style="s2">and interested in like what discussions</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.040" end="01:41:09.440" style="s2">each of us might</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.000" end="01:41:11.199" style="s2">be able to have about these things</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.440" end="01:41:12.960" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.199" end="01:41:16.080" style="s2">they&#39;re exciting and very adjacent to</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.960" end="01:41:16.080" style="s2">things that i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.840" end="01:41:22.159" style="s2">yeah in my last conversation with john i</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.000" end="01:41:24.800" style="s2">tried making an argument for the</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.159" end="01:41:25.760" style="s2">uh potentially video games as uh</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.800" end="01:41:27.520" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.760" end="01:41:29.280" style="s2">in virtue through the combination of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.520" end="01:41:30.800" style="s2">appreciation for</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.280" end="01:41:32.560" style="s2">for beauty along with the flow state</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.800" end="01:41:35.600" style="s2">induction they&#39;re just often</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.560" end="01:41:37.440" style="s2">not used to that potential and i</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.600" end="01:41:38.639" style="s2">try to get in contact with daniel greg</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.440" end="01:41:40.960" style="s2">who i know is doing the</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.639" end="01:41:42.320" style="s2">like some kind of rpg as well doing</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.960" end="01:41:43.840" style="s2">serious play</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.320" end="01:41:46.080" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if anyone has</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.840" end="01:41:47.600" style="s2">familiarity with his project or is in</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.080" end="01:41:49.040" style="s2">contact with him but i&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.600" end="01:41:51.840" style="s2">interested in this because</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.040" end="01:41:52.560" style="s2">in the past uh video games i i agree</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.840" end="01:41:54.320" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.560" end="01:41:56.239" style="s2">a lot of potential before creating a</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.320" end="01:41:57.520" style="s2">sacred space of perspectival and</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.239" end="01:42:01.840" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.520" end="01:42:01.840" style="s2">um i guess you could say liturgy maybe</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.800" end="01:42:10.320" style="s2">it it would be liturgy if you&#39;re</p>
