<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">the admissions teams will feel the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">way but</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s um he&#39;s yeah very very special</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">and teaches me things every day and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">we have these deep conversations around</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">things like you know the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">breaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">for me in terms of my awareness of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">are breaking the kind of barriers</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">what we assumed was magic you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">things that we identified as magic or</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">sci-fi</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">when they start to become real through</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">the advancements in our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">science and the advancements of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">the wielding of science for</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">technological advancement</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">you start to ask these really</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">philosophical questions around</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">whoa how is this breaking my previous</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">was real and what was magic and so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">that kind of ever-changing line between</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">between those two and how the arts</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:47.919" style="s2">particularly have a kind of liminal</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">relationship with with both in the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.919" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">that they can</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">break with science in order to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">the fantastical but then in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">open up our minds to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">huh i wonder if we should explore that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">and see if there is some some scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">or technological</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">truth behind this event it&#39;s what seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">like just pure imagination</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">so it&#39;s yeah fun times around the dinner</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">that sounds really good now one through</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">line that i saw on a lot of your work</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">at least since when you stopped being a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">performer we may get back to you about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">the performer&#39;s side but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">not is story and the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">storytelling as you say in the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">space between that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">you know the deep history of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">storytelling which probably goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">the dawn of language</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">and today where we&#39;re at this</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">intersection</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">of our typical narrative plus so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">media it&#39;s unbelievable so at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">highest level</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">what do you see as where we&#39;re at in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">evolution of storytelling maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">history of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">storytelling as you perceive it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">and i i definitely want to say that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">been influenced i have a lot obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">we all have a lot of influences but</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">particularly on this subject i would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">alex mcdowell from the world building</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">institute has</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a lot of great conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">about it and i definitely have learned</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">from him how he&#39;s framed this particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">evolution of storytelling but i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">what i have</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">observed is that we have these moments</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">you know storytelling from the early</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">earliest times</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">has allowed us to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">our emotions our ideas it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">part of what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">human it&#39;s part of what makes us able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">to operate as you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">on an abstract level that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">distinguishes us in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">i want to be careful about this it</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">distinguishes us from</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">other living beings but in some ways we</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">deeply in gratitude or need to be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">in gratitude to other</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">systems of you know life that educate us</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">like you know i think of octavia butler</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">and how she would observe</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">she was an amateur scientist she was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">sci-fi writer amateur scientist she</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">observe things like slime mold in her</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">her little home lab and identify how</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">these systems of organic systems would</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">be something that could educate humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">about how to better design our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">societies and systems so i was about to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">say that it distinguishes from us from</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">the animals or from the plants but in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">our storytelling allows us to better</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">access what is already an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">lesson in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">other living structures so when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">think about you know there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">research around storytelling in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">brain and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">the nature of language in the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">i think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">fascinating i remember hearing an npr</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">piece and i wish i had the exact</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">reference but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">where there was some children that had</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">pretty much had the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">kind of raised themselves alone in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">um a part of the jungle in south america</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">and were found at like eight nine ten</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">years old</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">um how this happened don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">there was an interview with one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">children who now was a grown person</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">and they talked about how they had a an</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">instinctual relationship to life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">it was very about you know food shelter</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">sleep like the very fundamentals of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">survival and when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">became and met and grew and started</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">integrating with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">developed language for the first time as</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">a 10 year old or eight-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">they actually started having abstract</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">on a higher level and and that is really</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">so you think about some of the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">which intelligence even works</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">is that it works through storytelling we</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">create through language and through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">of information back and forth between</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">people and trying to describe our</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">lived experiences to each other that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">how we access</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">deeper and higher and more abstract</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">levels of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">so going back that far to story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">like the fundamentals</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">but what&#39;s also interesting is that as</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">science and technology evolve we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">these disruptions</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">to our sense of reality right we learn</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">earth is not flat we learn that the sun</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">doesn&#39;t revolve around the earth</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">and these things fundamentally break</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">what we thought was our</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">fundamental reality and that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">the scientists and and the technologists</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">that are enabling observation or these</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">observations or so forth that is one</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">critical point in disrupting our reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">but then the next</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">step is that the philosophers and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">artists and the storytellers</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">have to recalibrate our sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">how does that make meaning how does that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">how do we recalibrate the meaning of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s where story is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">critical because</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s through those stories that are told</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">that we help</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">each other recalibrate we allow</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">ourselves to design systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">you know kind of help prescribe and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">um adopt behaviors and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen this over pattern over and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">over and over again and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">in the last you know you look at 500</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">years ago the printing press coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">it completely changed people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">reality people could read things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">the bible for themselves for the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">time literacy started to jump and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">then you have things like television</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">coming into play</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">right around where things like vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">you&#39;re able to see the front lines in</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">real time</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">and it changed people&#39;s relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">war in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">when you think about seeing earth from</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">space people</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">change their sense of borders and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">nations with that massive</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">communication and that story that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:30.639" style="s2">narrative that was being shared globally</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">and now we are at another disruption</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">of our sense of reality and that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">things like the bioengineering</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">advancements artificial intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">advancements</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">and the nature of communication</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">architecture in general</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">is totally disrupting our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">reality especially for those that have</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">at the kind of forefront of these fields</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">and it is critical that i in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">that artists people from humanities</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">are in conversation in collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">with the scientists and technologists</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">to help us to contextualize what does</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">this mean for our reality you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">people like yuval harari that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">claiming this is the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">homo dias and the end of homo sapien</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a bold</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">narrative to begin how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">collective conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:21.279" style="s2">and dialogue about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">something that we want to evolve into is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">that really true</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">like these are this is how story is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">critical for us trying to contextualize</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">our reality well very very well said</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">of course these challenges of new</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">information technologies go way back</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">those of us remember our socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">remember that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">old socrates had a pretty good view of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">writing he thought oh damn</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">it changes for the worse if we lost our</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">oral tradition and the ability to recite</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">the iliad from memory and what do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">think now</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">we came back in some social media holy</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">moly</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">right yeah i mean i mean my kids have</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">all the time this conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">cursive writing</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">they have no idea like</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">why do you guys like they can do their</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">signature and that&#39;s about it and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">understand the utility of cursive</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">writing but it&#39;s it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">to have some people</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">advocate strongly for maintaining that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">even though</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">functionally it&#39;s not necessary anymore</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">that kind of quick writing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">cursive i mean my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">it was invented to because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">having to when you we were in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">pre-printing press</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">kind of communication architecture</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">cursive writing allows you to go faster</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">smoother</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">um you know it just it sped up the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">process and it was a gorgeous art form</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">but is that a utility we need anymore is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">there something between the hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.560" style="s2">eye brain neurological relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">that are we losing something</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.560" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s what is really</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">interesting about the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">that are happening at the guild of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">future architects where i am currently</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">um you know kind of the key area of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">focus right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">is that we&#39;re constantly negotiating</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">what you know what of our past</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">have we lost that was something that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">needed to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">because now in hindsight we can see how</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">that would have benefited us to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">to maintain like certain practices or</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">ideas and then other things that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">know what is it that we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">let go of and how do we let go of or</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">does it move into something</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">that is an archived version of it rather</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.000" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">than a functional part of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">these are very challenging issues and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">one example that lynette walworth who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">an artist that we work with talks about</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">is how um indig a lot of indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">practices around the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">world maintained kind of practices that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">would have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">disregarded in a scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">kind of environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:47.560" style="s2">as shamanistic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">superstition right and now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.560" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">scientific evidence emerging</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">that some of these practices have</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">especially around</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">understanding intuition and uh i guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">the senses she was saying that we always</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">understood sight smell like these very</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">basic senses as</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">the human input for data and now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">starting to discover that humans</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">actually have many more</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">layers of senses that are input for data</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">that would be similar to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">weather patterns understanding</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">as you say there&#39;s a lot of scientific</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">for instance there&#39;s a whole school of</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">chimps is telling stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">i recently had nick chaderon who goes</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s basically just a bunch</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">to make up stories on the fly</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:51.360" style="s2">interesting and he quotes</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">well it is interesting that i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">grew up</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">my father would always say to us the</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">right so i think therefore i am so</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of these ideas around</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">and when you think about if the reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">of a person is their thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">then and you think about um i had a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">conversation with a billionaire</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">a couple years ago um who was</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">a really wonderful you know entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">who had</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">done an incredible job of building out</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">a venture capital fund around medical um</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">innovations but what was interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">he had no idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">when kind of all of the kind of binary</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">left-right</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">uh racial tension stuff started coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">um post around the 2016 election cycle</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">he was shocked he really had</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">thought that all of the racial tension</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">in this country had been resolved in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">civil rights movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">and that everything was hunky-dory and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">so he was shocked and so it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">he was surprised that he could be such a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">powerful um</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">person in the world and you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">and and be this ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">of the people that live just you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">down the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">down the road from him or in the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">town um having very different</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">experiences of the american experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">and to me that and so he went to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">like very this like two-year</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">deep dive into all these things and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">was like wow</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">he said my world has been quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">filtered for me to only experience a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">version of america</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">and for it to be so filtered from what</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">my neighbor or</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">someone else living in the other part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">town is experiencing he said he was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">shocked at how</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">you can have two totally different</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">realities living in the same town</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">and i think that that&#39;s what your like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">that mind is flat</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">kind of notion to me like that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">hear is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">you know even though there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">layers to reality you can walk around</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">and see from a pedestrian point of view</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">the things that human beings perceive</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">and completely miss</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">the tardigrades</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">like that perspective and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">reality that&#39;s a that&#39;s a filter bubble</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">and so so we do i think and that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">ideological realities it goes to i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">all of those things like what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">our reality is i mean we are and stories</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">are what illuminate those different</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">levels of our even understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">perception of how we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">and you can make up and we live in</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">a false reality as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">and we know some people that do these</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">and of course the arts are really</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">important for bridging</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">that gap right because it is easy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">live within a filter bubble but if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">pursue deep art you will find more of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">the truth than if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">for instance i grew up working class</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">half a redneck</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">fairly regressive attitudes about race</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">all kinds of bad things</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">and for me one of the biggest bridges</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">was my high school</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">english teacher said you should really</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">read james baldwin you will really like</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:32.080" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">because i had a love of language i had a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">love of deep thinking i had a love of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">sort of radical you know heart on your</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">sleeve writing and she said don&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">james baldwin so i did and kept reading</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">and reading and reading</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">and it radically changed me as a human</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">to understand that the doctrines i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">heard</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">from my neighbors and you know most of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">high school dropouts and what have you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really the whole story and so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">went through a big portal</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">through art and baldwin is a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">artist let there be no mistake about</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">he&#39;s an artist before he&#39;s a polemicist</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">though he is also both</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">but the quality of his writing it just</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">stirs you just reading it</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">oh yes he is definitely one of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">inspirations and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">and aspirations in life is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">definitely baldwin and others um of his</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">and just to your point like it also is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">really interesting to think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">well first of all i just want to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">know also honor</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">you being very vulnerable to say hey i</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">had this perspective and i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">and shifted</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">same i i want to be equally vulnerable i</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">mean i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">at a time when when it comes to race i</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">would say i grew up in a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">enlightened environment but</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">when it comes to lgbtq identities it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">very unenlightened</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">and went through a similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">awakening of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">my own bias and ignorances uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">and and it&#39;s just kind of like really</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">surprising</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">to me to be the same human being that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">had a completely different understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:07.919" style="s2">of reality then than i do now</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">so it is interesting how we evolve in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">our thinking through story</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">through relationships you know they call</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">out a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">voice who i think is hugely powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">has made a big impact on me and some</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">people</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">cheeky which is essentially he&#39;s doing</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s mind-boggling</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">in a pretty major way this fairly thin</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">book will do it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">like james baldwin it&#39;s also a great</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">work of art</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">not just intellectually interesting</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">the staging is very very simple but very</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">appropriate etc</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">let&#39;s dig into question bridge a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">bit and you know tell us where the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">came from</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">and sort of the mechanics how it worked</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">where the questions come from</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">how did you connect the questioners and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:10.559" style="s2">the answers which seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">must have been voluntary and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.559" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">self-organizing something like that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">way it worked oh definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">yeah so thank you so much for for</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">spending that amount of time on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">platform and uh with</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">with these incredible um voices so</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">question bridge is a media facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">dialogue among black men in america</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">and it started actually in 1996 by chris</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">johnson</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">who&#39;s one of the collaborators on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">question bridge black males version</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">but he did a version in 1996 between</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">um african americans in san diego that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">wealthy or in the upper class and those</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">in a lower income bracket trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">bridge the gap</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">in terms of these incomes and what was</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">the influence for him is</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">he was in brooklyn when redlining ended</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">and the fair housing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">act happened and he saw he would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">within months</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">the flight of high-income black folks</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">from black communities</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">and that was the beginning of he said</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">within a month he would see</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">the doctor&#39;s office boarded up the law</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">offices boarded up</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">certain stores started getting boarded</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">up and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">basically had gone from a very mixed</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">incoming kind of healthy</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">ecosystem even though it was oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">larger ecosystem of economics it at</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">least within</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">the microcosm of the black community</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">there was a diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">folks and that ended and then you saw</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">the kind of quintessential black</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">and he was really interested in trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">to understand that dynamic so that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">where it started in 96</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:48.960" style="s2">and some incredible insights came out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">that well hank willis thomas one of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.960" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">other collaborators was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">student of his in grad school and saw</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">him present on this work that he had</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">and he approached him and said can we</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">update it but instead of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">this economic conversation can we really</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">just have a dialogue among black</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">men in america and so that led to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">you know a 10-year project and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">basic methodology is put a camera in</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">front of</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">and male and say</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">can you ask a question of another black</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">man that you feel distant or estranged</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">and so we would capture these questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">on camera and sometimes they were very</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">specific questions like</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">you know i want to ask this of any black</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">police officers or i want to ask this</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">of you know black men that are dating</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">white women or of gay black men</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">or sometimes they were just general any</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">person that identified this way</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">and then we would go meet with other you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">put calls out on facebook all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">to set up a opportunity for people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">respond to those questions and then ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">their own questions so it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">emergent project and by the time i got</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">they had a thousand question and answer</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">and um i remember the first night uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">showing me these clips and me and dr joy</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">de gru</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">who wrote the book post-traumatic slave</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">syndrome we were both together and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">were asking for our advice</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">and we were looking through this and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">were like you can&#39;t edit out any of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">these voices and put it into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">documentary or even into</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">an installation in a museum because as</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">soon as you edit out</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">any one of these voices it becomes your</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">perspective on black male identity</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">rather than the organic reality of black</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">male identity</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where we decide where i</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">had been working in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">early exploration research on trans</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">media and interactive media</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">very influenced by artists like kat</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">sizzik who</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">was pioneering interactive participatory</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">documentary at the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the idea of bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">to an interactive</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">place where you did not ever have to cap</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">who got to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">bring their voice to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">and it turned into</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">a lot of different forms and has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">now um archived at the smithsonian</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">african-american museum very cool like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">terminals there you go</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">and play with it on or how was it</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">archived yeah so we basically we had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">five-channel installation</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:18.399" style="s2">that was a three-hour edit of all these</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">voices and then we would have laptops um</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.399" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">tablets um kiosks where people could</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">explore the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">according to their own curiosity the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">full unencumbered</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">um kind of uh grouping of voices i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">basically i think what you you saw on</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">questionbridge.com</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">um and they could also add if they if</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">they self-identified as black and male</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">they could contribute</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">their own question and they can answer</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">any questions so</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">it became and not only was it about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">video dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">but we also asked them to create a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">fingerprint profile</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">trying to reappropriate you know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">normally is used to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">kind of especially in the mass</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">incarceration system kind of book</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">black men into a very limited identity</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">as criminal or thug or violent</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">um and kind of unlock that fingerprint</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">to show we ask them to tag themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">with as many different identity tags</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">as they felt authentically described</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">them and we had a hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">it would probably break the container of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">this thing called black and male because</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">it would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">so many different tags that it you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">never say</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">black men are dot dot dot and in any</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">kind of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">because the and and i think our</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">hypothesis was proven</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">we created a word cloud and it was very</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">few words</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">that um ended up being used over and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">people found so many different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">identify themselves in so many nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">that it shows the true complexity then</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">we also had people</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">tag their dialogue and also allowed for</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">like a wikipedia-style tagging of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">and that also that data visualization</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">was also incredibly complex and diverse</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">it really kind of shows the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">thought and the diversity of identity</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">within this</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">kind of container yeah very cool and by</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">the way those tags were searchable</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">as i was doing my play i saw it had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">search box i started searching and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">realized i was getting things</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">that weren&#39;t in the words themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">i said ah</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">must be some tagging going on here</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">yeah yeah and it produced some very</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">interesting navigations</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">to give people a sense i&#39;m gonna if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">don&#39;t mind call out some of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">that were asked and in some cases give a</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">little sense of some of the answers</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">is that okay by you i would love it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">yeah one that happened to be the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">one i pulled up and there seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">certain amount of randomness of what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">see next</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">was very from the heart was how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">learn to love a woman when we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">have a good role model at home</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">and many of the guys struggled with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">and were sad</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">and confused but they were engaged with</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">it it was</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">yeah and it was a quite a mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">people on that one you know from</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">corner guys to conservative bourgeois</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">it all just came from that one question</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">of ask a guy something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">you you know you feel some ask someone a</p>

<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">request to ask that simple question it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">unlocks</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">this much depth and yeah in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">setting the tone</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">it was yeah i can well basically it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">the way my collaborators would i would</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">not be in the room when they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">filming because um it kind of changed</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">the environment when</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">i as a woman um was in the room it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">it there was a little bit of a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">relationship and when i was out of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">room it was really just black men</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:14.960" style="s2">in the room talking to other black men</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">there was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">vulnerability that was just phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">and i feel so honored that we got a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">chance that they shared themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">this vulnerable way on film so that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">could all</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">engage with their humanity that is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">mind-blowingly beautiful yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">screamed</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">authenticity to me i said damn there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">no here</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">that&#39;s true it was really good i made</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">notes on about ten of them but i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">go with just one more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">and this is back to your earlier point</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">and the question was</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">does being black mean i have to be one</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">thing that fits</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">in a box and you know i thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">very healthy that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">thought that right yes yes but they saw</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">it in very different ways and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">acknowledged the fact that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">world saw him in a box sometimes right</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">and i thought it was one of the richer</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">discussions and again</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">you know something that&#39;s very very good</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">just on that point</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">we created a 9 through 12 grade</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">curriculum and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">we would do teacher trainings um with</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">with teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">i was doing a teacher training in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">brooklyn uh and they were all black</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">teachers in the room um and and i played</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">that question on video i said you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">what is it um</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">basically what are the parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">blackness you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">what makes you black and then i went</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">around the room and i said</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">what do you do that is not black</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">and so the whole group had things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:43.359" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">that are considered not black some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.359" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">them were</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">going hiking some of them were knitting</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">one of them was i&#39;m a member of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">polar bear the polar bear club in new</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">until we then we had this deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">discussion like wow so being black means</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">you can&#39;t see a sunrise or a sunset on</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.040" style="s2">top of a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">being black means you can&#39;t knit being</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">black means you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">experience like it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">that how everyone broke it but everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">had subscribed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">this idea of the limitations of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">blackness that they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.079" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">they broke almost in like a oops i ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">acting black now but</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">really it&#39;s kind of really telling the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">kind of ways in which we tell ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">stories that put us in our own</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">boxes and other people also perform</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">this kind of limitation yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">sorry go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">yeah yeah no no very very important and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">good you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">frankly my advice to everybody is if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">think you&#39;re in a box blow the damn box</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">exactly yeah it&#39;s not good for you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">not good for the world and someone tries</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:56.510" style="s2">to put you in a box</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">tell them to go themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.510" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">now one thought that struck me and again</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">this is questionbridge.com people go</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">look at particularly if you&#39;re an old</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">white dude like me you&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">is have you thought about applying that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">technique to other domains i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">obvious one would be black women</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">absolutely um so that&#39;s the reason it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">was question bridge</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">calling black men because we actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">had intended to do not just black women</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">but we were creating a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">question bridge platform that people</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">could start their own question bridges</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">based on their</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">identity group they wanted to start and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">build out and so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">unfortunately the money that we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">raising for it didn&#39;t come in</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">and so we couldn&#39;t further it but we may</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">revisit it again</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll get some investor that might</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">come back around</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">yeah let me know i&#39;ll promote it i know</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">some rich people okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">sounds good i would pay money to see</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">the same technique applied to black</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">what do you see as how vr can enhance</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">the power of storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">oh wow so you know i just have to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">i have to give a lot of credit to shari</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">um i came on board pre-vr</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">when we were looking at a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">interactive documentary gaming filming</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">inter intersections and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">and things that were computational art</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">but i was virtual reality was</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">you know something that people tried in</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">the you know 90s or</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">you know and it never really took off</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">right and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">shari um saw this piece by noni de la</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">pena</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">called hunger in los angeles at usc</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">um and was just really struck by this</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">you know this kind of attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">extend journalism so that it wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">like we know television and film</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">extended journalism</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">by giving people a visual even a more</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">sense of liveness of the visuals of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">and uh noni&#39;s goal was to put you inside</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">and be complicit in the pieces that she</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">was reporting on</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">which is kind of gives you an even more</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">kind of complicit relationship with our</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">with our news so she decided to bring</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">this to sundance in 2012</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">and we couldn&#39;t bring the headset from</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">usc to park</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">city um it was a 50 000 headset they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">like heck no</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">and so her intern at the time was palmer</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">lucky who created the oculus rift</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">and he said oh i can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">use a smartphone um and uh figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">mount to allow people to still see this</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">to that smartphone and so that became</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">the prototype for the oculus rift and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">that came to sundance in 2012.</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">so i&#39;ve gotten i say all that to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">that having been there</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">that year and i&#39;ve gotten this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">really front row seat</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">to watching the kind of this wave of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">innovation around virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">and then augmented reality as well as</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">mixed reality hyper reality uh kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">take off and i&#39;ve seen a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">and sometimes when i present on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">works that have been quite influential</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">most people i i was at brown university</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.480" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">a couple years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">and after i did this big presentation on</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">all the different ways that i had seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">virtual reality being</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">invaded on and experimented somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">raised their hand and said i&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">to think that virtual reality is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">oral storytelling tradition because</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">i never get to see any of these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">i&#39;m dying to see them but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">accessibility was so limited right</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">i was probably one of the few people</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">that had because i got flown around the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">all the time to see people at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">cutting edge be able to experience this</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">so i say all that to say that most</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">people that have experienced virtual</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">reality have seen something that i would</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">is far inferior to the work at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">kind of heightened levels of the medium</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s just it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:36.560" style="s2">unfortunate because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">incredible work happening in this medium</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.560" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">never even been experienced so i say</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">that to start us</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">off um but i would say that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s more than just going into 360</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">and seeing you know the front back side</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">up and down</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">of an environment the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">being innovated in the space are</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">being able to for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">one national theater in the uk did a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">where it was one actor that was in full</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">mocap</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">connected to one audience member who was</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">also in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">mocap and also uh had a virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">headset on</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">and it was a story of a young man</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">saying goodbye to his mother who&#39;s dying</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">of cancer and so the whole virtual</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">was hand-drawn illustration and very</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">very effective and so you&#39;re as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">audience member you&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">hand-drawn illustration</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">of the story um having the last moments</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">with your mother</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">and because there&#39;s a one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">relationship and the actor is</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">in mocap in real time whenever the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">character in the film</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:47.119" style="s2">grabs your hand the actress also grabs</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">your hand so you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.119" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">the touch of a human touch while seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">this other reality through your</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">visual input and it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">she tucks you into bed she gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">hug and the experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">of having that level of a hyper reality</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">experience of the story</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">makes you feel like you&#39;re really there</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">on a level that you don&#39;t get from</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">um seeing things from a flat screen</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">from a distance you could certainly see</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">the potential</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">but yet at least in the mass audience</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">fallen way short of our expectations</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">hugely</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:24.880" style="s2">why do you think that is i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">would think that this is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.880" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">extension of say computer gaming</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">or something and yet you know it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">i&#39;ll confess to having been a gamer for</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">55 years right wow</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">that yes you are definitely the expert</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">my experience and i go back to you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">war games like the avalon hill games</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">little cardboard pieces on a cardboard</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">map</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">and do every iteration of gaming from</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">the early apple</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">all the way up to you know powerful</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">stuff that only runs on a 2 000</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">computer but and this is the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">thing i was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">but i have never looked at a vr</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">game and the answer is because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">never gotten enough social proof</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">from somebody else that it&#39;s worth my</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">while to do so</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">well i would tell you my experience and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">it could be a wrong analysis but</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">from being on the ground of the not only</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">the diy</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">makers but also the early kind of folks</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">that were had some resources to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">really incredible investment like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">early days of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">oculus story studios and the work that</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">they were doing with sasha unseld</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">as a creative director stuff was amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">but what was the ch this literally i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">told</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">by a number of investors both</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">venture capitalists as well as those</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">coming from certain gaming and filming</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">kind of executive</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">backgrounds that people got burned</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">during the free</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">content times of when you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">cd</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">and the dvd started to fall and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a tangible</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">transaction for revenue to come into a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">company and everything was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">loose on the internet and people really</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">got burned in terms of their investment</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">into content</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">and so when when virtual reality and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">this 1500</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">headset came on to the scene in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">investment people got</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">really excited about oh we can invest in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">this hardware</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">and we can see a revenue threshold that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">we haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">since the dvd that we haven&#39;t had since</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">the cd</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">and um and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">was a big carrot on a stick for industry</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">and for investment</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">but when it came to investing in content</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">the thing that we heard over and over</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">and over again was oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">the content community the maker</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">community will figure that out we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">going to invest in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">because everyone got burned and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">actually did a series of interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">uh within the industry i interviewed 130</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">people and this i heard this over and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:45:59.839" style="s2">and so the only artists that were</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">getting funded with any serious money</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.839" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">were people that had a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">patentable technology or some ip</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">that was not content i.p but it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">patented</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">or patentable hardware or software</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t the content itself so we</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">felt</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">so by the time you know the big hope was</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">when playstation came out with their</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">headset everybody was like oh good this</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">is going to be the great hope for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">industry</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">and we were a billion dollars short in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">revenue expectations for that christmas</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">and the reason over and over that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:37.839" style="s2">stated was there was no content</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">why you can spend 1500 or even 900 on a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.839" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">headset</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">with no content and i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">quite frankly because i did see</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">incredible content</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">but it was so little snippets nobody</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">really invested in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s one of the analyses</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">there could be many others</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">that people might come up with um the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">other thing to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.839" style="s2">frank the most compelling xr experiences</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">that i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.839" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">are installation based and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">something that you can put into a home</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">um and that&#39;s not the best business</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">model for people that are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">the new dvd</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">indeed yeah yeah when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">about the you know the ip rip</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">offs and yeah that&#39;s certainly been a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">big issue in certain media but as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">once you got the playstation you now</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">have a grounded medium</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:23.920" style="s2">for making money right because they</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">knock that damn thing down pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.920" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">and if you want the content you got to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">pay for it so you would have thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">that if there was a space for</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">reasonably accessible exploration say</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">for a few million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">people would have tried it and yet i</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">guess they did but</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">as i said i&#39;ve got no social proof no</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">friend of mine has come to me and said</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:47.359" style="s2">jim god damn it you have to check this</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.359" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">right and so you know my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">somehow it has failed</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">even though it now has a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">which real revenue could be made</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">i mean we know how big the game market</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">is it&#39;s huge right</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s huge and i think another challenge</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">i definitely that was said over and over</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">again like all the content makers that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">were supporting couldn&#39;t we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">the hardest time in the world getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">the support that they needed because</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s expensive it&#39;s expensive to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">prototype and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">to really fine i mean the sitcom didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">come until 20 years after tv</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">was established as an emerging medium</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">you know where are we on that curve</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">we&#39;re you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">vr is a 40-year medium but with this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">particular jump in the fidelity and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:38.559" style="s2">the ability to have higher quality</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">work um the other thing i often cite is</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.559" end="00:48:42.720" style="s2">when people first started trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">content on a blackberry that was</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.720" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">shitty experience it was horrible and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">and then you know come 20 2016 i</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">remember i</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">binge watched game of thrones on my cell</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">phone</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">maybe like 80 hours because i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">watch it on my tv because i had little</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">kids in the house</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">so you know in my own within a 10-year</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.559" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">and we we need to evolve the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">mass adaptation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">set-top relationships to this technology</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">to get to what</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">the innovators have already discovered</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">in terms of best practices and craft</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">and i feel the same way is true so</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">interactive doc</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">still has not been able to bring its</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.359" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">with virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">but i definitely think um with augmented</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">reality</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">um breathe by diego fosse</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">he was he basically had a breathing</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">apparatus around our</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">our la you know around our torso and</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:39.359" style="s2">and he is through augmented reality</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.200" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">visualizing our breath and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.359" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">it intermingles with each other but then</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">he had an augmented reality tree come up</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">in the middle of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">we could see how our breath goes</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">directly into the tree circulates with</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">it and then he expanded expand until</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">you get to see kind of this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">to the globe of our own breathing</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">and then two weeks later he sends you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">real-time data of how</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">your breath traveled over that two-week</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:05.359" style="s2">period based on</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">systems of air circulation on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.359" end="00:58:09.520" style="s2">i mean you know i&#39;m just saying like the</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">the technology and those for sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">but another piece that i didn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">say talk about yet was a piece</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">the middle of the installation</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.920" end="00:59:09.599" style="s2">there was a small miniature house all</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">white</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.599" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">um that was sitting in the middle of</p>

<p begin="00:59:14.960" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">onto this so that there was real</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">projection mapping on to the so you you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">know gave the contours of the house and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">and gave a landscape of green grass and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">so forth around the house</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:28.000" style="s2">and then the projection mapping and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">ar and this was phone based they are not</p>

<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">the projection mapping you could see the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">little characters</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">in the house through the projection</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">mapping and then they would come out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">the door</p>

<p begin="01:05:29.839" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">found a place to</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.039" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">to take on the installation of it ah</p>

<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:39.760" style="s2">interesting here at the cutting edge</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.480" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">so you talked about it on some of your</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.760" end="01:05:44.720" style="s2">podcasts where you appeared</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">is that to your mind the modern artist</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.720" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">has to also kind of be an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:50.720" style="s2">to figure these things out</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">right yeah for sure i mean i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:53.599" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a blessing and a curse it</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.599" end="01:05:56.160" style="s2">depends like</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:57.760" style="s2">those that can be very entrepreneur i i</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.160" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">studied i went and got my master&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.760" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">as well as my bfa so i have both</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">um and a lot of artists are</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:06.400" style="s2">instinctually</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">like when i went and got my master&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.400" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">business i was shocked i was very</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">intimidated going into it i was like oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:13.039" style="s2">my god here&#39;s this little like artsy</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:15.440" style="s2">girl trying to go get a business degree</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.039" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">and i went in there um and i was mostly</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:18.960" style="s2">with engineers</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">um and people that were you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.960" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">business oriented but a lot of engineers</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:25.680" style="s2">at this particular school and um</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:26.960" style="s2">and i was like oh this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.680" end="01:06:28.559" style="s2">artists already do</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.960" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">like artists that are hustling to try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.559" end="01:06:33.200" style="s2">get their work</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:35.200" style="s2">seen and supported and to make a living</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.200" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">the like it was just a translation issue</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.200" end="01:06:37.680" style="s2">like much of it was just me learning the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">language of</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.680" end="01:06:41.359" style="s2">the business world to kind of do do the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:43.920" style="s2">kind of loss in translation</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.359" end="01:06:45.280" style="s2">and then i brought that back um teaching</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.920" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">entrepreneurship to artists through</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.280" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">fractured atlas through the savannah</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:51.200" style="s2">school of art and design</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:52.640" style="s2">and other forms and it was really</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.200" end="01:06:54.400" style="s2">interesting some of my artists</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.640" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">when i would take them through the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.400" end="01:06:57.520" style="s2">process of creating a standard business</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">plan would go from making no money on</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.520" end="01:07:00.319" style="s2">their art</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.000" end="01:07:01.520" style="s2">to being independent within a year just</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.319" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">because they were able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.520" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">you know were encouraged to create a</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">business plan and i felt</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:09.039" style="s2">i graduated with my bfa without even</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:11.839" style="s2">having had a class</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.039" end="01:07:12.240" style="s2">around how to get an agent as an actress</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.839" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.240" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">literally no business education no</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:18.799" style="s2">industry education whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">coming out of a top world class that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.799" end="01:07:22.559" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:24.720" style="s2">since i mean the side came out in 99 but</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.559" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s pretty unfortunate anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.720" end="01:07:27.680" style="s2">i say that to say</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.240" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">that i do believe in the power of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.680" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">entrepreneurship i think artists are</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">natural entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">in many different ways there is a need</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.960" end="01:07:36.000" style="s2">to either</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">be an entrepreneur yourself or to have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.000" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">close partner</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">that is going to be a partner you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">going to be a business partner with you</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.359" end="01:07:44.480" style="s2">they actually have a term for it in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">visual arts world called the artist&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.480" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">wife</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.280" end="01:07:51.599" style="s2">which is interesting i like it</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:52.559" style="s2">a little sexist there but what the hell</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.599" end="01:07:54.640" style="s2">oh hugely</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.559" end="01:07:56.480" style="s2">usually sexist but yeah just from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.640" end="01:07:59.200" style="s2">statistics they showed that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.480" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">most of the artists that had made it had</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.200" end="01:08:02.240" style="s2">a partner that was very close to them</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">that was their business</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">uh manager but but anyway i saw that say</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:07.599" style="s2">because you can&#39;t do everything not even</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">if they are business savvy</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.599" end="01:08:09.839" style="s2">you just can&#39;t do everything on your own</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">and you need to get the right</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.839" end="01:08:12.559" style="s2">collaborators and partners around you as</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">you&#39;re building your business</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.559" end="01:08:15.599" style="s2">but sorry go ahead to your point i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:17.040" style="s2">i think i went a little off</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.599" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">no it&#39;s actually actually good you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.040" end="01:08:19.759" style="s2">it&#39;s funny you mentioned in passing the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:21.440" style="s2">savannah</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.759" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">school of art and design my daughter is</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.440" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">a graduate of scad</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">really yeah they have you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">their mottos is we do not</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:32.000" style="s2">educate starving artists right</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">you know they take some rudiments of</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.000" end="01:08:36.239" style="s2">business they have a portfolio</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">class in the senior year and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.239" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">convince them that</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">you can&#39;t eat by art alone most likely</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">right unless you&#39;re picasso or something</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:48.080" style="s2">and even he starved for quite a while</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:50.719" style="s2">and so it is important but it is also i</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">do want to say that also i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.719" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">i do have to say that i&#39;ve seen a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">a challenge in</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:09:00.239" style="s2">a mark only market-based art economy</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">versus economies that do support artists</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:05.759" style="s2">in terms of what the artist has to</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.480" end="01:09:08.159" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.759" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s i mean you definitely</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.159" end="01:09:11.600" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be navel gazing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:13.199" style="s2">you know kind of creating masturbatory</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.600" end="01:09:14.799" style="s2">work that nobody beyond yourself is</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:18.000" style="s2">going to appreciate for sure</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.799" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">but i also think that some of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.000" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">compromises that artists make in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">purely market-based art economy</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.159" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">limits the full scope of what we may</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:29.679" style="s2">need as a society in terms of reflection</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">and engagement and i think that some of</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.679" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">the especially in emerging technology</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">even not even just from the artistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:36.319" style="s2">side but just the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:37.279" style="s2">technological innovations that connect</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.319" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">with art</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.279" end="01:09:40.799" style="s2">or that artist that those that have</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:43.120" style="s2">found this really beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:44.560" style="s2">connection between art and technology a</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.120" end="01:09:46.159" style="s2">lot of them are in europe</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.560" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">where they have a different model for</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.159" end="01:09:49.679" style="s2">supporting artists until</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:51.359" style="s2">something takes off and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.679" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">that i saw artists in this country have</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.359" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">to make certain compromises on that in</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.880" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">terms of quality</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">um and in terms of the depth of their</p>

<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:35.360" style="s2">was interesting talking to her because</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.640" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">when she was at</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:40.880" style="s2">zynga she talked a lot about how</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">it was really hard for her she really</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.880" end="01:10:43.360" style="s2">wanted to increase the kind of story</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:45.360" style="s2">elements of some of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.360" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">work that was coming out and they were</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.360" end="01:10:49.440" style="s2">kind of very resistant they just wanted</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:52.000" style="s2">kind of using the addictive design model</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.440" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">of let&#39;s give them quick rewards</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.000" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">keep people you know going after those</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:56.320" style="s2">quick rewards and we know now that those</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.320" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">major mental health issues with those</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">addictive design processes like</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">a lot of casual games use and it also</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:05.760" style="s2">obviously is a cash cow because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">getting people addicted to these</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.760" end="01:11:09.440" style="s2">small endorphin that design in the boost</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:11.920" style="s2">of these endorphins</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.440" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">and she was trying to argue for can we</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:14.159" style="s2">build a little bit more story a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">bit more character</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.159" end="01:11:17.679" style="s2">and got a lot of resistance finally she</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">brought in all this</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.679" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">statistics and metrics and laid it all</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">out and really really fought to get a</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">little bit more leverage</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">and she was able to get i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:30.239" style="s2">it was a regional or geo-specific</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">kind of area but she got a test area to</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.239" end="01:11:33.600" style="s2">to test</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:34.880" style="s2">this theory around story and around more</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.600" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">you know kind of in-depth</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.320" style="s2">relationship with this stuff she did it</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">and what they found out</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.320" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">where they were resistant because it it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:44.320" style="s2">was it was a loss in terms of short-term</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">income because you didn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.320" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">addictive design kind of super fast</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:49.600" style="s2">you know let me buy another packet of</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:51.600" style="s2">gold kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.600" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">but what she found what they found long</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.600" end="01:11:55.440" style="s2">term is that they had much more loyalty</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:57.679" style="s2">and actually made a higher profit</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.440" end="01:11:59.679" style="s2">from deeper and you know kind of more</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.679" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">engaging story and character</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.679" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">so this is one of those tensions that i</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">think the market</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">sometimes has a bit of a myopic you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:09.440" style="s2">kind of look</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:10.960" style="s2">at and they they&#39;re not willing to take</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.440" end="01:12:12.320" style="s2">that risk of let&#39;s try something a</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:14.239" style="s2">little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.320" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">you know advanced in terms of artistry</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.239" end="01:12:16.560" style="s2">or whatever because it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">market fail</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.560" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">when in reality if you give it the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:22.640" style="s2">an investment actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:24.320" style="s2">is healthier mentally and becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.640" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">engaging in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.320" end="01:12:27.520" style="s2">and more profitable ultimately i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:28.480" style="s2">that&#39;s where there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.520" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">tension between</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.480" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">i definitely think artists are</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:32.719" style="s2">entrepreneurs but i also think we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:35.840" style="s2">some marketplace issues that</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.719" end="01:12:37.120" style="s2">can produce sometimes the wrong outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.840" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s unfortunately a trend</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.120" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">throughout our society that when we hook</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:44.800" style="s2">absolutely everything to the tight cycle</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">of short term money on money return</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.800" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">we basically grind everything into crap</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:55.199" style="s2">you said it much more eloquently than me</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:12:57.120" style="s2">a little bit of an overstatement but</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.199" end="01:12:59.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a hell of a lot of truth to it</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.120" end="01:13:00.159" style="s2">make a good point that we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.440" end="01:13:02.560" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.159" end="01:13:04.239" style="s2">of our social design and it would be</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.560" end="01:13:06.640" style="s2">great to have more room</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.239" end="01:13:07.920" style="s2">for socially supported art and as you</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.640" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">say some other countries do a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:11.040" style="s2">lot better job of it than the united</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:13.040" style="s2">states does</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.040" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">and it really does not mean less money</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.040" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">ultimately i think it actually means</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.320" end="01:13:17.120" style="s2">more money it&#39;s just more patient</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">capital you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.120" end="01:13:20.880" style="s2">exactly now the art of storytelling here</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:23.760" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.880" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">sort of post-modernist age we live in</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.760" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:29.040" style="s2">post-modernism rejects broad powerful</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:32.400" style="s2">narrative at least</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.040" end="01:13:34.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s academic sense it does</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.400" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">but in the history of storytelling</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.880" end="01:13:40.320" style="s2">archetypes have always been important</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">you know the joseph campbell etc</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.320" end="01:13:45.679" style="s2">what do you think about archetypes and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:47.440" style="s2">storytelling in the modern post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.679" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">age</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.440" end="01:13:50.960" style="s2">wow really interesting that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">bringing that up um</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.960" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">so okay i have this i wrote a paper</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:57.280" style="s2">about this in</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:13:58.400" style="s2">undergrad around post-modernism and this</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.280" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.400" end="01:14:00.800" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">articulate it as fluidly as i would have</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.800" end="01:14:04.719" style="s2">back then but</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.840" end="01:14:05.199" style="s2">um i was at nyu studying experimental</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.719" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">theater</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.199" end="01:14:08.239" style="s2">very postmodernistic theater i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:10.640" style="s2">studying</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.239" end="01:14:11.280" style="s2">um theater critique so we had to go deep</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.640" end="01:14:13.280" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.280" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2">kind of all the ways in which the</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.280" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">evolution of here the history of theater</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">and obviously this relates to all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.480" end="01:14:19.199" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.400" style="s2">movements surrealism and dadaism and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.199" end="01:14:22.320" style="s2">mean all the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.400" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">movements that are kind of uh both</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.320" end="01:14:25.120" style="s2">artistic movements</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:27.040" style="s2">as well as ideological or philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.120" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">movements and um</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.040" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">of course we studied post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.880" end="01:14:31.840" style="s2">while i was studying these things i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:34.000" style="s2">also taking</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">a lot of cultural anthropology courses</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.000" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">as well as</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">the history of latin theater history of</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:40.080" style="s2">african theater the history of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:41.280" style="s2">islamic theater the history of asian</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.080" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">theater so i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.280" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">deeply interested in trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:47.600" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:48.640" style="s2">how the arts and storytelling show up</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.600" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.640" end="01:14:54.400" style="s2">cultures and it was really really</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">interesting to think about</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.400" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">post-modernism in that context</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:15:03.040" style="s2">because you know essentially</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">post-modernism is you know has this kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.040" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.600" end="01:15:08.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really stupidly simplify it</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:11.360" style="s2">everything is random there is no</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.159" end="01:15:12.400" style="s2">central truth there is no um stable</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:15.840" style="s2">which really makes sense for a time</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:17.360" style="s2">where people&#39;s sense of reality is</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.840" end="01:15:19.280" style="s2">getting disrupted left right and center</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.360" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">from not only science and technology but</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.280" end="01:15:22.560" style="s2">a whole new ideological lens on cultural</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:25.760" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.560" end="01:15:27.040" style="s2">and so we&#39;re where a postmodernist might</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.760" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">say there is no truth everything is</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.040" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">random</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">it was my ex because i was i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:33.679" style="s2">an example i was watching this one</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:37.120" style="s2">anthropological</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.679" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">film where a group of european</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">anthropologists went</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">to a village in pacific islands</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">and they watched a ceremony that looked</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:50.719" style="s2">kind of crazy violent but then when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.800" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">really understood the whole story behind</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.719" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">it it actually was a story and a</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">ritual of coming to peace and</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">tranquility and they were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.120" end="01:16:01.920" style="s2">how basically there&#39;s there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:04.080" style="s2">of this dichotomous thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.920" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">if something is you know which a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.080" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">kind of uh epistemological</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">systems can be very binary it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:13.760" style="s2">black or white yes or no good or bad</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">wrong or right and when you come out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.760" end="01:16:16.239" style="s2">a context where</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:17.679" style="s2">you know especially coming out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.239" end="01:16:18.400" style="s2">european imperialism where there was a</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.679" end="01:16:21.920" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.400" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">let&#39;s go you know kind of bring</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.920" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">god to the world to save the world or</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">let&#39;s bring civilization to the world to</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:30.960" style="s2">civilize everybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:32.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of a noble kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.960" end="01:16:33.920" style="s2">approach and so then you get to these</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.719" end="01:16:34.640" style="s2">places where something that looks</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.920" end="01:16:36.719" style="s2">heathen and</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.640" end="01:16:38.480" style="s2">quote unquote savage and you really get</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.719" end="01:16:39.679" style="s2">to understand it from an anthropological</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.480" end="01:16:42.000" style="s2">level you&#39;re like oh my god this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.679" end="01:16:44.159" style="s2">actually quite beautiful and amazing</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.000" end="01:16:45.920" style="s2">then it can my because this is all</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.159" end="01:16:47.679" style="s2">happening 50s 60s</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.920" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">when there was a kind of an opening of</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.679" end="01:16:53.280" style="s2">the aperture around these narratives</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:54.800" style="s2">that that there&#39;s this one way is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.280" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">right way and we&#39;re going to bring</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.800" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">our civilization to others and i think</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:16:59.920" style="s2">that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">in my opinion a postmodern perspective</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.920" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">came as like oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:06.080" style="s2">if my truth if my kind of traditional</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:08.320" style="s2">arts and ideology you know is true and</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.080" end="01:17:08.719" style="s2">this which looks completely 180</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.320" end="01:17:10.800" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:12.560" style="s2">degrees true then everything that</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.800" end="01:17:16.400" style="s2">nothing&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.560" end="01:17:18.560" style="s2">and everything is random and i felt like</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">you know that&#39;s looking at you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.560" end="01:17:22.159" style="s2">earth from a perspective if</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:24.000" style="s2">i&#39;m in a sandy desert then that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:25.600" style="s2">truth and you&#39;re standing in an icy</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.000" end="01:17:27.440" style="s2">mountain then that&#39;s your truth and</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.600" end="01:17:27.920" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to verbally communicate oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.440" end="01:17:29.360" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.920" end="01:17:31.040" style="s2">this is earth and you&#39;re like no this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.360" end="01:17:33.040" style="s2">earth no this is earth no this is earth</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.040" end="01:17:34.320" style="s2">and then when you widen up and you see</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.040" end="01:17:36.719" style="s2">it from space you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.320" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">both of these things are earth and by</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.719" end="01:17:40.080" style="s2">the way this desert might be flooded</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:42.000" style="s2">plain and be completely water</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:43.920" style="s2">on one part of the year and this icy</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.000" end="01:17:45.280" style="s2">mountain might be a spring awakening in</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.920" end="01:17:46.320" style="s2">another part of the year so nothing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.280" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">stable</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not true it just</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">means that it&#39;s dynamic and it&#39;s truth</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.640" end="01:17:54.800" style="s2">yeah i like that actually there are some</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:56.239" style="s2">useful things in post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.800" end="01:17:58.400" style="s2">particularly you know the critical</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:18:00.400" style="s2">perspective on the flaws of modernism</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.400" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">but when you take naive post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.400" end="01:18:02.640" style="s2">and say that it&#39;s all random that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">true either</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.640" end="01:18:05.760" style="s2">right but change is real right change</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.760" end="01:18:10.800" style="s2">all the time so i like i like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:12.960" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a very nice synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:14.320" style="s2">thank you and i i say that to say that</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.960" end="01:18:17.360" style="s2">when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.320" end="01:18:18.640" style="s2">story and narrative um there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:20.400" style="s2">movement right now among</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.640" end="01:18:22.159" style="s2">narrative change and kind of social</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.400" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">justice workers where</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.159" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2">the framing is you know each star in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.719" end="01:18:28.480" style="s2">sky</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:29.920" style="s2">is like a story but it&#39;s those who draw</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.480" end="01:18:32.640" style="s2">the lines between the stars doing a</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.920" end="01:18:36.159" style="s2">constellation or making a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:37.199" style="s2">and um there&#39;s a lot of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.159" end="01:18:38.640" style="s2">right now about how</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.199" end="01:18:40.719" style="s2">who is drawing the lines between the</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.640" end="01:18:42.480" style="s2">stars to</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.719" end="01:18:43.760" style="s2">help us understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.480" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">between these stars</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.760" end="01:18:47.360" style="s2">into this narrative right so i would say</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">that that is a strong</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.360" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">kind of element of story exploration</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:53.360" style="s2">right now especially with</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:54.480" style="s2">speculative fiction and speculative</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.360" end="01:18:57.600" style="s2">historiographies</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.480" end="01:18:59.840" style="s2">people are really trying to revisit</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.600" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">the stories that we&#39;ve been told and</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.840" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">re-examine</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:03.920" style="s2">all of the narratives that have kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:05.679" style="s2">like manifest destiny as being</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.920" end="01:19:08.800" style="s2">re-examined as a narrative and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.679" end="01:19:10.320" style="s2">and so forth you know yep yep absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.800" end="01:19:12.719" style="s2">and that makes sense i like that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.320" end="01:19:14.800" style="s2">sort of preserve the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.719" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">of historical narrative forms but look</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.800" end="01:19:19.360" style="s2">at it with a fresh eye</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:23.520" style="s2">right well you</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.360" end="01:19:26.320" style="s2">it&#39;s i think it&#39;s about being willing to</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:26.719" style="s2">draw the star map completely differently</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.320" end="01:19:28.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:29.920" style="s2">see oh there yeah you can draw a bull</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.320" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">there but you can also draw a crab</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.920" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">and you can also draw a panther with</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:36.400" style="s2">those same stars</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.360" end="01:19:38.800" style="s2">ah that&#39;s true too and nothing is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;re all right and just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.800" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.440" end="01:19:43.040" style="s2">people&#39;s perspectives so that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:44.640" style="s2">locked into</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.040" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">there&#39;s only one way to draw these stars</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.640" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s as a bull</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:49.280" style="s2">you know uh so when you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.280" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m just i&#39;m trying i know that went</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:56.000" style="s2">a little bit far afield on that</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:57.120" style="s2">but i i think that there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.000" end="01:19:57.840" style="s2">thin line between archetype and</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.120" end="01:20:01.199" style="s2">stereotype</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.840" end="01:20:03.520" style="s2">obviously as we all know and i think um</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.199" end="01:20:04.960" style="s2">but there are kind of universal aspects</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">of the human condition and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.960" end="01:20:09.120" style="s2">human experience that is a constant</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">refrain and is universal</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.120" end="01:20:12.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s that i think that&#39;s critical</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:13.600" style="s2">to storytelling and then there&#39;s ways in</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.400" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">which we complicate that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.600" end="01:20:17.520" style="s2">that i think is equally critical to</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.520" end="01:20:21.840" style="s2">i like it unfortunately we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.120" style="s2">short on time here i got lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.840" end="01:20:25.760" style="s2">of other interesting</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.120" end="01:20:26.320" style="s2">things to dig into but let&#39;s go to the</p>

<p begin="01:20:26.320" end="01:20:31.120" style="s2">piece of my notes which is to tell us</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.320" end="01:20:32.960" style="s2">about the guild of future architects</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.120" end="01:20:35.679" style="s2">i like guilds i&#39;m interested in them in</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.960" end="01:20:36.800" style="s2">fact i was a co-founder of a makerspace</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.679" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">here in a little town</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:41.280" style="s2">stanton virginia and me and my</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:43.199" style="s2">co-founders organized it as a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.280" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">initially but with no intent to make any</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.199" end="01:20:45.930" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:48.320" style="s2">and we never did guess what but</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.930" end="01:20:49.600" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.320" end="01:20:51.360" style="s2">but then we converted it to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.600" end="01:20:53.040" style="s2">not-for-profit once it got big enough to</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.360" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">stand on its own two feet</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.040" end="01:20:58.639" style="s2">and we created a new set of bylaws and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">called it the council of guilds</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.639" end="01:21:02.239" style="s2">and it literally has a way to form</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:04.639" style="s2">guilds in the areas of our</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.239" end="01:21:06.480" style="s2">maker space we have fiber art we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.639" end="01:21:08.000" style="s2">woodworking we have metal working we</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">have pottery we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.000" end="01:21:12.560" style="s2">graphic arts we have robotics and each</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:14.080" style="s2">one can establish a guild and then the</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.560" end="01:21:16.239" style="s2">legal equivalent of the board of</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.080" end="01:21:17.920" style="s2">directors is the council of guilds with</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.239" end="01:21:19.280" style="s2">one representative from each guild it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:21.600" style="s2">really quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.280" end="01:21:23.120" style="s2">wow that&#39;s phenomenal i would love to</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.600" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">talk to you more and learn from your</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.120" end="01:21:26.639" style="s2">experience</p>

<p begin="01:21:33.120" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">is our legal bylaws and which is even</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.600" end="01:21:40.320" style="s2">more cool we got it through the virginia</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:43.280" style="s2">state corporation commission which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.320" end="01:21:45.199" style="s2">somewhat tight-ass and even better we</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.280" end="01:21:48.320" style="s2">got it through the irs and got our</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.199" end="01:21:51.679" style="s2">401 c 3 designation which is even harder</p>

<p begin="01:21:59.360" end="01:22:03.040" style="s2">that just gives a little background my</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.639" end="01:22:04.320" style="s2">personal motivation why i am interested</p>

<p begin="01:22:11.199" end="01:22:18.000" style="s2">a mission to support future architects</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.400" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">as a guild um but basically sharon shang</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.000" end="01:22:21.679" style="s2">who&#39;s the founder</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:23.679" style="s2">is somebody who comes out of you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.679" end="01:22:24.960" style="s2">madison avenue advertising</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.679" end="01:22:27.280" style="s2">you know she was the chief creative</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.960" end="01:22:30.480" style="s2">officer for huge media</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.280" end="01:22:32.560" style="s2">um uh franchises like american idol so</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.480" end="01:22:35.360" style="s2">you think you can dance all these things</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.560" end="01:22:36.639" style="s2">and she kind of decided to step back</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.360" end="01:22:39.360" style="s2">from that world</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.639" end="01:22:40.560" style="s2">and go into deep um social</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.360" end="01:22:42.960" style="s2">entrepreneurship and</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.560" end="01:22:44.080" style="s2">basically impact and they call it impact</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.960" end="01:22:45.520" style="s2">investing i don&#39;t know if she would use</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.080" end="01:22:46.880" style="s2">those exact words</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.520" end="01:22:48.239" style="s2">but she started experimenting with</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.880" end="01:22:48.960" style="s2">capital and experimenting with</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.239" end="01:22:51.520" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.960" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">for social good and had about 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.520" end="01:22:54.239" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:55.360" style="s2">in it and she kept noticing patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.239" end="01:22:58.480" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.360" end="01:23:00.080" style="s2">around what she would identify as people</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.480" end="01:23:02.000" style="s2">that are architects of the future and</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.080" end="01:23:03.520" style="s2">architects of systems that become our</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.000" end="01:23:05.760" style="s2">you know that that we end up end up</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.520" end="01:23:06.719" style="s2">becoming our reality as we move into</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.760" end="01:23:09.600" style="s2">that future</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.719" end="01:23:10.159" style="s2">and she was really fascinated by her own</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.600" end="01:23:12.000" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.159" end="01:23:13.520" style="s2">that had been able to architect systems</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.000" end="01:23:14.400" style="s2">and futures she had architecture</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.520" end="01:23:16.800" style="s2">background as well</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:18.159" style="s2">formally educated in architecture and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.800" end="01:23:20.880" style="s2">was really curious about</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.159" end="01:23:22.719" style="s2">that as a metaphor for people that are</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.880" end="01:23:26.560" style="s2">designing future systems</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.719" end="01:23:29.440" style="s2">not only through the lens of</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.560" end="01:23:30.639" style="s2">equity and justice sustainability thrive</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.440" end="01:23:33.199" style="s2">ability in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.639" end="01:23:34.320" style="s2">you know economic viability but also in</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.199" end="01:23:36.480" style="s2">terms of beauty</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.320" end="01:23:37.840" style="s2">because she has a high heightened sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.480" end="01:23:39.040" style="s2">of aesthetics and beauty</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.840" end="01:23:41.280" style="s2">and when she thinks about beauty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.040" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">not glamour it&#39;s not you know that</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.280" end="01:23:44.480" style="s2">kind of beauty it&#39;s really the way i</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:47.040" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.480" end="01:23:48.639" style="s2">is you&#39;re looking at if we&#39;re designing</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.040" end="01:23:51.679" style="s2">systems that are not oppressive</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.639" end="01:23:53.760" style="s2">systems that allow people to have what</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.679" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">they need to fulfill their potentials</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.760" end="01:23:58.239" style="s2">then you start to see something that i</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;ve seen on a global scale</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.239" end="01:24:02.320" style="s2">ever in human history and that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:05.120" style="s2">systems that unlock human potential</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.320" end="01:24:06.400" style="s2">on all kinds of levels and that is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.120" end="01:24:08.400" style="s2">beauty piece of it</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.400" end="01:24:09.440" style="s2">when you see people in there being able</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.400" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">to fulfill their potential it</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.440" end="01:24:11.679" style="s2">contributes</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:13.679" style="s2">into a shared prosperity both</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.679" end="01:24:15.280" style="s2">economically and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.679" end="01:24:17.280" style="s2">in terms of artistically in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.280" end="01:24:19.280" style="s2">emotionally in terms of community</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.280" end="01:24:20.560" style="s2">and so the guild of future architects</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.280" end="01:24:22.159" style="s2">are people that are coming from a</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.560" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">diverse array</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.159" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">of kind of disciplines and fields of</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:29.679" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:32.880" style="s2">but they all agree on wanting to design</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.679" end="01:24:36.000" style="s2">at a systems level things that are both</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.880" end="01:24:39.120" style="s2">just equitable and prosperous</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.000" end="01:24:40.560" style="s2">but also unlock human potential cool</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.120" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">how does one become a member of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.560" end="01:24:44.639" style="s2">guild well we are just</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:46.080" style="s2">still it&#39;s been very curatorial to this</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.639" end="01:24:47.920" style="s2">point because we&#39;re a year in we have</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.080" end="01:24:50.639" style="s2">145 members</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.920" end="01:24:52.320" style="s2">um and we&#39;ve been really hand picking</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.639" end="01:24:53.920" style="s2">everybody based on</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.320" end="01:24:56.320" style="s2">them having a strong practice of</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.920" end="01:24:57.920" style="s2">collaboration co-creation</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.320" end="01:24:59.840" style="s2">and that they have a strong expertise in</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.920" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">their field and that they are</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.840" end="01:25:04.239" style="s2">um really generous in their their</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">because this is a learning organization</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.239" end="01:25:07.520" style="s2">and so that&#39;s been our first kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:10.800" style="s2">criteria</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.520" end="01:25:12.080" style="s2">and now that we&#39;re at 145 um everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.800" end="01:25:13.679" style="s2">like the government the complete</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.080" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">governance is all every everyone on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.679" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">board is a member</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:18.000" style="s2">the staff are all members all of our</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:19.360" style="s2">contractors are members so it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.000" end="01:25:21.040" style="s2">self-designed self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.360" end="01:25:23.679" style="s2">self-governed organization</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.040" end="01:25:24.840" style="s2">um and so this will be the next phase as</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.679" end="01:25:28.159" style="s2">we open up</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.840" end="01:25:30.239" style="s2">membership to application</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.159" end="01:25:32.159" style="s2">how are we going to make sure that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.239" end="01:25:34.239" style="s2">grow at the speed of trust</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.159" end="01:25:35.280" style="s2">instead of just kind of growing just</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.239" end="01:25:37.440" style="s2">based on who can</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.280" end="01:25:38.400" style="s2">bring in cachet or money or those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.440" end="01:25:40.960" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.400" end="01:25:41.679" style="s2">that we really do hold trust um as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.960" end="01:25:43.280" style="s2">high value</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.679" end="01:25:44.719" style="s2">so how do we bring people in that are</p>

<p begin="01:26:18.480" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">way to become a member of the gold leaf</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.719" end="01:26:23.840" style="s2">guild was to have your father be a</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:25.199" style="s2">member of the gold league deal but there</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.840" end="01:26:27.679" style="s2">were other ways in through</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.199" end="01:26:29.840" style="s2">typically fairly onerous apprenticeships</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.679" end="01:26:31.520" style="s2">four to seven years and then you had to</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.840" end="01:26:33.199" style="s2">create a masterpiece and you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:35.280" style="s2">word masterpiece</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.199" end="01:26:36.960" style="s2">actually had a specific meaning you made</p>

<p begin="01:26:40.480" end="01:26:43.760" style="s2">was that&#39;s where that word comes from</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.880" end="01:31:00.400" style="s2">have three programs we have our</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.760" end="01:31:01.199" style="s2">community practice which is 145 members</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.400" end="01:31:02.880" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.199" end="01:31:04.639" style="s2">we have a shared future program which</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.880" end="01:31:07.120" style="s2">are collectives of members</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.639" end="01:31:09.040" style="s2">that are working on specific design</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.120" end="01:31:10.719" style="s2">designing specific systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.040" end="01:31:12.159" style="s2">and future and working towards specific</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.719" end="01:31:13.679" style="s2">future states and then the collective</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.159" end="01:31:16.000" style="s2">wisdom platform</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.679" end="01:31:18.080" style="s2">is where you know we can use the best of</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.000" end="01:31:21.120" style="s2">in terms of media and technology</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.080" end="01:31:23.840" style="s2">to coordinate future architects</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.120" end="01:31:24.239" style="s2">uh within and beyond the guild we can</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.840" end="01:31:26.639" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.239" end="01:31:27.520" style="s2">learning processes so that we are</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.639" end="01:31:28.960" style="s2">whether anything</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.520" end="01:31:30.480" style="s2">succeeds or fails there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.960" end="01:31:31.760" style="s2">learning and we always feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.480" end="01:31:33.199" style="s2">going to succeed if we can capture that</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.760" end="01:31:33.760" style="s2">learning and share it in an open source</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.199" end="01:31:37.440" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.760" end="01:31:39.920" style="s2">and then the third piece is media and as</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.440" end="01:31:41.280" style="s2">we&#39;re creating all these ideas about</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.920" end="01:31:43.840" style="s2">possible futures</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.280" end="01:31:44.480" style="s2">how are we creating storytelling that</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.840" end="01:31:47.920" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.480" end="01:31:50.239" style="s2">illustrate that and spark ideas</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.920" end="01:31:52.080" style="s2">about possibility and open up people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.239" end="01:31:53.600" style="s2">minds to possibilities but also spark</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.080" end="01:31:54.800" style="s2">dialogue around is this the future we</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.600" end="01:31:55.520" style="s2">want and let&#39;s have a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.800" end="01:31:57.520" style="s2">around that</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.520" end="01:31:59.760" style="s2">and so some of the examples that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.520" end="01:32:02.080" style="s2">coming out of it right now</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.760" end="01:32:03.920" style="s2">we have a documentary series called the</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.080" end="01:32:05.760" style="s2">radical imagination project</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.920" end="01:32:07.920" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out of it we have a couple</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.760" end="01:32:10.320" style="s2">of books that are emerging out of it</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.920" end="01:32:11.520" style="s2">and we ran a 10-week sprint of futurist</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.320" end="01:32:12.639" style="s2">writers rooms that were open to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.520" end="01:32:15.679" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.639" end="01:32:17.440" style="s2">and out of that process we have 30</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.679" end="01:32:19.199" style="s2">different narratives about speculative</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.440" end="01:32:20.880" style="s2">histories that</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.199" end="01:32:22.320" style="s2">surface design principles and</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.880" end="01:32:24.960" style="s2">aspirational futures</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.320" end="01:32:26.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re pretty freaking awesome so</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.960" end="01:32:26.960" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be continuing to evolve</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.400" end="01:32:29.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.960" end="01:32:30.719" style="s2">media and tech kind of arm of the guild</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.040" end="01:32:32.639" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.719" end="01:32:34.159" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot of things that need</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.639" end="01:32:36.639" style="s2">to be done there i mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.159" end="01:32:38.159" style="s2">you know the money on money return</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.639" end="01:32:40.320" style="s2">platforms like</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.159" end="01:32:41.840" style="s2">facebook and twitter while there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.320" end="01:32:43.520" style="s2">good work that happens there</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.840" end="01:32:45.840" style="s2">it&#39;s at least arguable at this point</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.520" end="01:32:47.520" style="s2">that they&#39;re doing more harm than good</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.840" end="01:32:49.920" style="s2">and you know thinking through what the</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.520" end="01:32:52.000" style="s2">platforms look like that allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.920" end="01:32:53.520" style="s2">collectively reason to have collective</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.000" end="01:32:55.600" style="s2">intelligence and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.520" end="01:32:57.920" style="s2">you know it&#39;s above my pay grade but to</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.600" end="01:33:00.320" style="s2">eventually get to collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.920" end="01:33:01.440" style="s2">strikes me as the kind of things we need</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.320" end="01:33:04.080" style="s2">to do we&#39;re going to make it that</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.440" end="01:33:06.400" style="s2">hundred years you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.080" end="01:33:07.280" style="s2">i&#39;m telling you it&#39;s so critical and we</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.400" end="01:33:09.440" style="s2">have some</p>
