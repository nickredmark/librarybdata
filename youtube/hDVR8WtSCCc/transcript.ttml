<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:13.299" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk a bit about so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.879" end="00:00:15.789" style="s2">difference between American and UK media</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.299" end="00:00:18.130" style="s2">that sort of balance between alternative</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.789" end="00:00:20.890" style="s2">media and mainstream media I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.130" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">just sort of introduced myself a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.890" end="00:00:23.500" style="s2">bit and then asked you to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.000" end="00:00:25.410" style="s2">yourself in case there&#39;s people on that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.500" end="00:00:29.710" style="s2">channel who aren&#39;t familiar with you</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.410" end="00:00:31.930" style="s2">so my background I I worked for channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.710" end="00:00:34.179" style="s2">4 news for many years in the UK and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.930" end="00:00:36.159" style="s2">the BBC and then made documentaries for</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.179" end="00:00:39.850" style="s2">several years so I&#39;ve worked in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.159" end="00:00:41.829" style="s2">newsroom in the mainstream media swith</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.850" end="00:00:45.339" style="s2">what you probably call the the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.829" end="00:00:47.350" style="s2">mainstream media and also for the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.339" end="00:00:48.909" style="s2">year and a half or so I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.350" end="00:00:51.399" style="s2">been sort of delving more deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.909" end="00:00:54.339" style="s2">YouTube after setting up rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.399" end="00:00:55.989" style="s2">the the YouTube channel so I kind of had</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.339" end="00:00:59.229" style="s2">a bit of a steep learning curve in terms</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.989" end="00:01:01.389" style="s2">of seeing the difference between the two</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.229" end="00:01:03.729" style="s2">but it&#39;s been a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.389" end="00:01:06.700" style="s2">journey and sort of producing</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.729" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">documentaries and films on on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.700" end="00:01:11.740" style="s2">and can you tell me a bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:12.820" style="s2">background and what you&#39;ve maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.740" end="00:01:15.370" style="s2">little bit of what you&#39;ve learned doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.820" end="00:01:18.400" style="s2">it over the last however many years</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.370" end="00:01:20.650" style="s2">sure so now I host the David Pakman show</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">which is a multi-platform independent</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.650" end="00:01:25.780" style="s2">progressive show based in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:27.850" style="s2">multi-platform meaning that the program</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.780" end="00:01:30.370" style="s2">is on radio stations it&#39;s on television</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.850" end="00:01:32.170" style="s2">stations it&#39;s on satellite TV on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.370" end="00:01:33.910" style="s2">channel called free speech TV and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.170" end="00:01:35.950" style="s2">independently we also have an online</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.910" end="00:01:39.130" style="s2">presence with a YouTube channel and an</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.950" end="00:01:41.080" style="s2">audio podcast and in terms of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.130" end="00:01:43.690" style="s2">changed I mean of course on an on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.080" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">technical side it&#39;s changed and I hope</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.690" end="00:01:48.280" style="s2">for the better as you know my production</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:51.010" style="s2">team has expanded and gotten more more</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.280" end="00:01:52.270" style="s2">tech-savvy and technology has continued</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.010" end="00:01:53.730" style="s2">to improve and become more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.270" end="00:01:58.630" style="s2">but I think from from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.730" end="00:02:01.450" style="s2">perspective point of view at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.630" end="00:02:03.640" style="s2">beginning I would tend to do much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.450" end="00:02:05.710" style="s2">of the on the one hand on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.640" end="00:02:07.300" style="s2">sort of presentations and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.710" end="00:02:09.069" style="s2">that that was both not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.300" end="00:02:10.630" style="s2">interesting to me that I really wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.069" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">to be giving my opinion my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.630" end="00:02:14.650" style="s2">and it also wasn&#39;t super interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">the audience because</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.650" end="00:02:19.570" style="s2">it was you know either way there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:21.310" style="s2">going to be people who disagree and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.570" end="00:02:23.170" style="s2">might as well just do the best job I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.310" end="00:02:25.660" style="s2">kind of advocating for what I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.170" end="00:02:27.460" style="s2">think is best or the best policy so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.660" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">think over time the program has</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.460" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">certainly become more more opinionated</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">than it started as I&#39;d love to return to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:38.500" style="s2">that a bit later on because there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">this sense that this this kind of view</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.500" end="00:02:43.240" style="s2">from nowhere affectation that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">mainstream media has has been shown up</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.240" end="00:02:48.370" style="s2">quite a lot by the growth of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:50.590" style="s2">media as being as being an affectation</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.370" end="00:02:52.090" style="s2">like there is no view from nowhere and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.590" end="00:02:54.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s becoming really much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.090" end="00:02:56.530" style="s2">clear one of the reasons that I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.280" end="00:02:57.880" style="s2">really keen to talk to you David was I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.530" end="00:02:59.590" style="s2">did I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.880" end="00:03:02.530" style="s2">I confess I wasn&#39;t that aware of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.590" end="00:03:04.030" style="s2">show until I sort of diving into my</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.530" end="00:03:09.490" style="s2">preparation for my interview with Dave</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.030" end="00:03:12.460" style="s2">Rubin and I I I saw that I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.490" end="00:03:14.410" style="s2">the things in the online media space at</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.460" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">the moment is it&#39;s very easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.410" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">caught in reality tunnels it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:20.530" style="s2">to end up giving your audience what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">want and I could see that at times you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:24.970" style="s2">take an unpopular the unpopular</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:27.270" style="s2">perspectives with your audience and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.970" end="00:03:29.860" style="s2">you seemed willing to engage with people</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.270" end="00:03:31.990" style="s2">from all over the political spectrum but</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.860" end="00:03:34.180" style="s2">from a from what I could see from a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.990" end="00:03:36.670" style="s2">good faith perspective and being willing</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.180" end="00:03:39.940" style="s2">to to say things that might make you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.670" end="00:03:41.140" style="s2">unpopular is that is that have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.940" end="00:03:44.200" style="s2">could you tell me about some of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.140" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">occasions that have that have happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.200" end="00:03:48.670" style="s2">on your channel and why has that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.830" style="s2">happened do you think well I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.670" end="00:03:53.170" style="s2">think certainly everything I say is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.830" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">unpopular with someone I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.170" end="00:03:57.340" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting at is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.000" end="00:03:59.380" style="s2">there have been stories where there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.340" end="00:04:01.290" style="s2">more of a backlash from what I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.380" end="00:04:03.960" style="s2">would perceive to be maybe my core</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.290" end="00:04:07.090" style="s2">progressive audience you know -</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.960" end="00:04:09.190" style="s2">generally well to the left of someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.090" end="00:04:11.520" style="s2">like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden but</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.190" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">still probably to the right of actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.520" end="00:04:15.640" style="s2">socialists and communists so to speak so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:19.000" style="s2">some somewhere in there and in the sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.640" end="00:04:20.680" style="s2">of world of social democracy and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.000" end="00:04:21.940" style="s2">know my principle has been and going</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.680" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">back to the first thing we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.940" end="00:04:24.820" style="s2">in kind of explaining to you the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.260" style="s2">philosophy of my show and how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.820" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">gotten away from this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.260" end="00:04:30.920" style="s2">on the one hand on the other hand the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:34.010" style="s2">view from nowhere and just really doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.920" end="00:04:36.980" style="s2">every story the way I see it I recognize</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.010" end="00:04:39.230" style="s2">that you&#39;re never going to see eye to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.980" end="00:04:41.000" style="s2">eye on every issue with any particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.230" end="00:04:43.370" style="s2">person I mean with people that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:46.040" style="s2">consider to be my strongest political</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.370" end="00:04:47.780" style="s2">allies there there still can be areas of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.040" end="00:04:52.010" style="s2">disagreement and they&#39;re almost always</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.780" end="00:04:54.140" style="s2">are so the approach that I&#39;ve taken to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.010" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">just do every story the way I see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.140" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">regardless of the consequences is based</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:03.500" style="s2">in I just want to be genuine right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:04.760" style="s2">if I start moderating and by moderating</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.500" end="00:05:06.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean moving to the middle but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.760" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">mean being a moderator of my own speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.830" end="00:05:10.910" style="s2">on the basis of what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:13.400" style="s2">audience reaction will be it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.910" end="00:05:14.840" style="s2">actually potentially a slippery slope I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.400" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get into and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:19.160" style="s2">cautious of slippery slopes when I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">think they apply but that actually could</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.160" end="00:05:22.340" style="s2">be a slippery slope I don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:25.040" style="s2">into you so for example there was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.340" end="00:05:27.950" style="s2">recent story in the United States about</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.040" end="00:05:31.760" style="s2">a congresswoman named Alan Omar where</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.950" end="00:05:34.850" style="s2">she made some comments related to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.760" end="00:05:37.190" style="s2">Israel lobby and there were a number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.850" end="00:05:39.740" style="s2">perspectives on what she said ranging</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.190" end="00:05:42.410" style="s2">from it was downright evidence of her</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.740" end="00:05:44.810" style="s2">personal anti-semitism all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.410" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">the other side of it was a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.810" end="00:05:50.030" style="s2">analysis that was in no way tinged with</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:52.070" style="s2">anti-semitism and I took what I knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.030" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">would be a position that some of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.070" end="00:05:57.500" style="s2">audience would disagree with or or take</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2">issue with but I decided to take it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.500" end="00:05:59.630" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:06:02.690" style="s2">you know if I looked at my youtube</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.630" end="00:06:04.520" style="s2">analytics I probably had a net loss of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.690" end="00:06:07.760" style="s2">subscribers as a result of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.520" end="00:06:09.920" style="s2">story and that&#39;s okay and I think that</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.640" end="00:06:32.780" style="s2">makes sense we&#39;re in a media environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.620" end="00:06:37.160" style="s2">that really doesn&#39;t reward nuance it</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.869" end="00:06:53.479" style="s2">our issues where if you ignore the</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.020" end="00:09:18.530" style="s2">general sense of it so to speak yeah why</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:20.180" style="s2">don&#39;t why don&#39;t you why don&#39;t you sketch</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.740" end="00:09:25.330" style="s2">it seemed that Ben Shapiro in particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.270" end="00:09:27.410" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very familiar with UK</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.330" end="00:09:29.740" style="s2">journalistic styles which is very</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:43.850" style="s2">Andrew Neil is famously right-wing he</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.020" end="00:09:46.790" style="s2">accused Andrew Neal of being clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.850" end="00:09:48.410" style="s2">left-wing interviewer yeah I thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.790" end="00:09:51.230" style="s2">that there were you know that my</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.410" end="00:09:53.390" style="s2">analysis I I maybe am more familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.230" end="00:09:55.280" style="s2">that style than at least ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.390" end="00:09:56.840" style="s2">appeared to be during that particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.280" end="00:09:58.970" style="s2">interview although my familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.840" end="00:10:00.740" style="s2">with Andrew Neil was was limited</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.970" end="00:10:03.380" style="s2">although I was generally aware of him as</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.740" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">a as a conservative individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.380" end="00:10:07.340" style="s2">personally so I wasn&#39;t so surprised by</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:10.100" style="s2">the interviewing style my surprise was</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.340" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">really maybe as you&#39;re hinting at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.100" end="00:10:14.510" style="s2">way that ben shapiro handled it who</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">within the context of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.510" end="00:10:19.160" style="s2">and often in particular during these</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:21.140" style="s2">events that he does at colleges and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.160" end="00:10:23.240" style="s2">universities where he&#39;s being questioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.140" end="00:10:25.820" style="s2">primarily by by college students</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.240" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">effectively there&#39;s this idea that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.820" end="00:10:31.670" style="s2">never rattled and that his mind operates</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:33.590" style="s2">so quickly and that you can&#39;t trick him</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.670" end="00:10:35.690" style="s2">in any way and that he&#39;s always one step</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.590" end="00:10:38.390" style="s2">ahead and ready with the sort of most</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.690" end="00:10:42.980" style="s2">powerful brutal refutations as many</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.390" end="00:10:46.070" style="s2">YouTube clip titles like to point out so</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.980" end="00:10:47.660" style="s2">I was most surprised by the way that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.070" end="00:10:50.540" style="s2">was so thrown off by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.660" end="00:10:52.220" style="s2">interview was going um and then it got</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.540" end="00:10:55.130" style="s2">very quickly to where you know two</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.220" end="00:10:59.090" style="s2">principles that ben shapiro espouses</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.130" end="00:11:02.030" style="s2">almost to a level of satire in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.090" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">United States are this idea of facts</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.030" end="00:11:05.900" style="s2">don&#39;t care about your feelings and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:07.400" style="s2">being very much against so-called</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.900" end="00:11:09.230" style="s2">identity politics as</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.400" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">to find in a sort of very particular way</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">and where it kind of broke down was that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:17.630" style="s2">been violated both of those ideas right</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:21.530" style="s2">his incorrect perception of the identity</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.630" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">of the interviewer caused him to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.530" end="00:11:26.180" style="s2">cut it short on the basis that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:28.550" style="s2">progressive left-wing whatever term you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.180" end="00:11:31.090" style="s2">want to apply to the interviewer was not</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.550" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">interviewing him in good faith or was</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.090" end="00:11:35.830" style="s2">employing some kind of gotcha questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:39.260" style="s2">or however you you want to analyze it</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.830" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">one of his principles in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.260" end="00:11:43.640" style="s2">how he&#39;s known in the u.s. is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:45.290" style="s2">identity is not relevant in situations</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.640" end="00:11:47.030" style="s2">like this that it&#39;s all about what are</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.290" end="00:11:49.100" style="s2">the facts and in a sense his feelings</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.030" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">sort of got the best of him his feelings</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:54.440" style="s2">overrode the facts which were the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:57.080" style="s2">questions posed to him by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.440" end="00:11:58.940" style="s2">interviewer and the reality that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.080" end="00:12:00.890" style="s2">interviewer was actually a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.940" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">personally not not on the left so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.890" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">was the what was so interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">that someone who is known in the US as</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">being sort of unshakably principled in</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:15.730" style="s2">identity doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">the facts it&#39;s all about reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.730" end="00:12:20.990" style="s2">abandoned that as he was very rattled by</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.610" end="00:12:24.520" style="s2">the way that the interview was carried</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.990" end="00:12:27.140" style="s2">out yeah I mean this is a good time to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.520" end="00:12:29.960" style="s2">to mention Dave Rubin so I went</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.140" end="00:12:31.870" style="s2">interview Dave Rubin a bit over a month</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.960" end="00:12:34.970" style="s2">ago now and put the interview out</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.870" end="00:12:40.070" style="s2">probably two weeks ago something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.970" end="00:12:41.270" style="s2">that and I I first found out about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.070" end="00:12:42.020" style="s2">intellectual diet web through Dave</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.270" end="00:12:46.610" style="s2">Reubens</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.020" end="00:12:49.100" style="s2">show and so I was sort of very I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.610" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">was i admired a lot of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.100" end="00:12:53.000" style="s2">that I&#39;d seen on the show and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:55.310" style="s2">paid a huge close attention to the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.000" end="00:12:57.230" style="s2">interviews that he&#39;d done and then in</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.310" end="00:12:59.840" style="s2">the research for the interview that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.230" end="00:13:02.210" style="s2">did with Dave I dug up quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.840" end="00:13:05.570" style="s2">stuff that made that that gave me a few</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.210" end="00:13:07.460" style="s2">concerns and I knew that going in for my</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.570" end="00:13:10.760" style="s2">own sort of self-respect as a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.460" end="00:13:12.680" style="s2">I had to ask some more probing questions</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.760" end="00:13:14.990" style="s2">Michael the criticisms that I see any of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.680" end="00:13:18.470" style="s2">you that I think have some some validity</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.990" end="00:13:20.360" style="s2">is sometimes you draw this you talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.470" end="00:13:21.950" style="s2">about a new center evolving but</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.360" end="00:13:24.200" style="s2">draw that new center around some people</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.950" end="00:13:26.120" style="s2">that that I would consider on the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.200" end="00:13:27.170" style="s2">let Stefan Stefan modern you for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.120" end="00:13:28.459" style="s2">well I&#39;ve never said that stefan</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.170" end="00:13:29.690" style="s2">molyneux Xin the new center</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.459" end="00:13:34.310" style="s2">I really have you ever heard me say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.690" end="00:13:36.649" style="s2">I thought you had no I checked again</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.310" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">after the interview one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.649" end="00:13:40.370" style="s2">got in touch as well is that this has</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:42.170" style="s2">started happening more and more at Dave</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.370" end="00:13:45.310" style="s2">Reubens events that there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:47.839" style="s2">are asking him why won&#39;t you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.310" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">contra points why won&#39;t you talk to Carl</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.839" end="00:13:52.010" style="s2">kolinsky why won&#39;t you talk to Sam cedar</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:54.769" style="s2">why won&#39;t you talk to David Pakman and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.010" end="00:13:57.589" style="s2">know recently as well that he he said on</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.769" end="00:14:00.140" style="s2">stage that you&#39;d lied about him or he</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.589" end="00:14:03.260" style="s2">gave a reason why he wasn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.140" end="00:14:04.339" style="s2">interviewed by you or to interview me I</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.260" end="00:14:06.200" style="s2">guess it was yeah he said</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.339" end="00:14:07.790" style="s2">Pacman&#39;s lied about me I think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.200" end="00:14:09.290" style="s2">bunch of times or many times or</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.790" end="00:14:11.029" style="s2">something like that I still you know if</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.290" end="00:14:14.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the case then I really want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.029" end="00:14:16.279" style="s2">know what what those lies or you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.630" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">would argue that they wouldn&#39;t really be</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.279" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">lies they might be Mis statements which</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:21.980" style="s2">I very well might have made about Dave</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:25.000" style="s2">Rubin I just don&#39;t know what they are I</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.980" end="00:14:28.970" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard so far I mean listen my</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.000" end="00:14:31.910" style="s2">perspective is so I&#39;m not a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.970" end="00:14:36.279" style="s2">per se dave rubin is not a journalist we</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.910" end="00:14:39.260" style="s2">are doing programs that are commentary</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.279" end="00:14:42.130" style="s2">interview analysis call it sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.260" end="00:14:44.899" style="s2">you want so you know my primary</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.130" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">criticism of the way that dave rubin has</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.899" end="00:14:49.699" style="s2">carried out interviews are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:53.000" style="s2">there&#39;s two criticisms one is I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.699" end="00:14:55.730" style="s2">that left-wing voices outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.000" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">so-called intellectual dark web have</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.730" end="00:15:00.290" style="s2">been mostly excluded now I know that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.269" style="s2">recently there were assertions made that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.290" end="00:15:04.279" style="s2">Dave is interviewed I don&#39;t know if he</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.269" end="00:15:05.720" style="s2">said it was socialists and communists or</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.279" end="00:15:07.670" style="s2">lefties and communists or something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.720" end="00:15:09.019" style="s2">that that may be true I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.670" end="00:15:11.480" style="s2">know who those folks are and I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.019" end="00:15:14.420" style="s2">interested in knowing about that but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.480" end="00:15:17.810" style="s2">think generally speaking if what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.420" end="00:15:19.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have to give equal voice to all</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.810" end="00:15:23.240" style="s2">sides of the political spectrum that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:26.870" style="s2">totally fine not to but I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.240" end="00:15:30.350" style="s2">you are sort of asserting that there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.870" end="00:15:32.540" style="s2">a sort of open-door policy to all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.350" end="00:15:33.970" style="s2">of ideas then I think it would be best</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.540" end="00:15:37.939" style="s2">to more equally</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.970" end="00:15:39.619" style="s2">represent ideas from a variety of sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.939" end="00:15:41.779" style="s2">of placements on the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.619" end="00:15:44.569" style="s2">so that&#39;s been one of my criticisms and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.779" end="00:15:47.779" style="s2">you know we I tentatively at one point</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.569" end="00:15:49.939" style="s2">was going to be appearing on on Dave&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.779" end="00:15:52.519" style="s2">new program and then it didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.939" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s not completely clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.519" end="00:15:57.230" style="s2">exactly why and I think at this point I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:15:59.389" style="s2">don&#39;t have the open invitation that at</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.230" end="00:16:00.619" style="s2">one point I did so I would be glad to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.389" end="00:16:03.529" style="s2">one of those people and I would be glad</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.619" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">for others to be those folks you know my</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.529" end="00:16:08.089" style="s2">particular interest in this is that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:09.980" style="s2">used to be relatively friendly with Dave</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.089" end="00:16:13.819" style="s2">and we used to text and have phone calls</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.980" end="00:16:15.230" style="s2">with some sporadic regularity I guess it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.819" end="00:16:17.179" style="s2">would be the term I would apply to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.230" end="00:16:20.389" style="s2">and since I interviewed him on my</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.179" end="00:16:22.429" style="s2">program for an hour we&#39;ve had almost no</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.389" end="00:16:24.559" style="s2">communication and there&#39;s been what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.429" end="00:16:26.629" style="s2">perceived to be sort of like a cutting</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.559" end="00:16:28.100" style="s2">of what was at one point a very cordial</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.629" end="00:16:30.259" style="s2">and friendly relationship and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.100" end="00:16:31.970" style="s2">know why that is I don&#39;t know he&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.259" end="00:16:33.649" style="s2">expressed that he wasn&#39;t happy with how</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.970" end="00:16:36.139" style="s2">the interview with me went where I did</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.649" end="00:16:39.860" style="s2">go into policy in the way that I liked</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.139" end="00:16:42.350" style="s2">to healthcare taxation etc so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.860" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">sort of my personal interest in it as</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.350" end="00:16:46.970" style="s2">far as the one other thing I&#39;ll say is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:50.839" style="s2">as far as the interview style yes I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.970" end="00:16:52.360" style="s2">been critical of giving a platform and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.839" end="00:16:54.379" style="s2">that&#39;s the term I use and I don&#39;t use it</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.360" end="00:16:56.839" style="s2">preservative Lee when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.379" end="00:16:58.939" style="s2">platform and you invite someone to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.839" end="00:17:01.910" style="s2">you are sharing that platform with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.939" end="00:17:04.399" style="s2">other person I take special care because</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.910" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">of how I manage my show where if I am</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.399" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">platforming someone whose ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:14.329" style="s2">perceive to be extreme dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:16.699" style="s2">discriminatory problematic I make sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.329" end="00:17:20.329" style="s2">that I&#39;m responsibly platforming them</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.699" end="00:17:22.970" style="s2">which includes both being prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.329" end="00:17:26.389" style="s2">take on what I perceive to be bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.970" end="00:17:28.700" style="s2">arguments and not being afraid to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.389" end="00:17:31.700" style="s2">clear that I disagree with some of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:33.649" style="s2">arguments or positions I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.700" end="00:17:36.710" style="s2">see Dave do that and as I&#39;ve told him</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.649" end="00:17:38.990" style="s2">personally he can kind of manage those</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.710" end="00:17:41.299" style="s2">interviews however he wants but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.990" end="00:17:42.919" style="s2">how I would feel good about handling</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.299" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">some of those interviews now the reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.919" end="00:17:47.570" style="s2">maybe he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable being</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">that adversarial that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.570" end="00:17:52.250" style="s2">perfectly fine the reason may be that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:55.370" style="s2">agrees with those things that maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.250" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">see as problematic positions or some</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.370" end="00:17:58.820" style="s2">other reason I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">reason is but it&#39;s not how I would sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.820" end="00:18:05.269" style="s2">of run my program if there are critiques</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">out there of Dave Rubin or whoever which</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.269" end="00:18:10.700" style="s2">are limited to this is a person who is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.740" style="s2">doing something wrong because of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.389" end="00:19:26.690" style="s2">and I don&#39;t understand the value of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.350" end="00:19:30.200" style="s2">merely giving someone a platform to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.690" end="00:19:32.029" style="s2">espouse those ideas so what I&#39;m for is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.200" end="00:19:33.169" style="s2">responsible platforming I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.029" end="00:19:34.700" style="s2">interviewed all sorts of right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.169" end="00:19:36.529" style="s2">people people with really disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.700" end="00:19:39.049" style="s2">views but the only way that I feel good</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.529" end="00:19:40.789" style="s2">about it about doing it is if it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.049" end="00:19:43.730" style="s2">abundantly clear that is I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.789" end="00:19:45.860" style="s2">these horrible ideas and I&#39;m prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.730" end="00:19:47.539" style="s2">push back against them so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.860" end="00:19:49.190" style="s2">that Dave Rubin has done interviews for</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.539" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">example with folks like Brigitte Gabriel</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.190" end="00:19:53.419" style="s2">where she actually touts anti-semitic</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:55.940" style="s2">conspiracy theories and Dave doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.419" end="00:19:57.620" style="s2">push back against it that&#39;s what my</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.940" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">critique is of it&#39;s not of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.620" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">he interviewed someone who&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.820" end="00:20:00.860" style="s2">winger</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:01.220" style="s2">I completely agree that&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.860" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.220" end="00:20:05.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not a productive one and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">going to I mean listen we the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.510" end="00:20:09.500" style="s2">should engage with the right the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:12.530" style="s2">if it wants to should engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.500" end="00:20:14.659" style="s2">left but it needs to be done in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.530" end="00:20:16.460" style="s2">responsible way and that&#39;s my approach</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.659" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">to it since the interview that I did</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.460" end="00:20:23.150" style="s2">with Dave Rubin there have been quite a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:26.900" style="s2">few pieces on various left-leaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.150" end="00:20:28.669" style="s2">channels about him not just off because</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.900" end="00:20:30.620" style="s2">of my interview although Sam cedar did</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.669" end="00:20:32.929" style="s2">pick it up and run something on my</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.620" end="00:20:34.820" style="s2">interview and I get a sense of almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.929" end="00:20:36.950" style="s2">like a feeding frenzy around him at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.820" end="00:20:39.559" style="s2">moment and is that something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.950" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">picking up I&#39;m picking it up as well I</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.559" end="00:20:45.380" style="s2">think it&#39;s gotten momentum and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:47.690" style="s2">that there has been sort of because of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.380" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">the you know that there&#39;s no better way</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.690" end="00:20:52.820" style="s2">to get something discussed on a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">YouTube channels than to mention the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.820" end="00:20:55.490" style="s2">names of the hosts of those YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:20:56.990" style="s2">channels to some of these people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.490" end="00:20:58.850" style="s2">have shown up at Dave&#39;s events and said</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.990" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">hey what about David Pakman or Sam cedar</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.850" end="00:21:04.309" style="s2">of contra points that&#39;s a great way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:06.260" style="s2">get that story onto those shows for</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.309" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">better or worse but I do think you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.260" end="00:21:10.520" style="s2">listen what&#39;s going on with Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">is not uniquely bad I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.520" end="00:21:18.909" style="s2">combination of sort of a a an audience</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:21.770" style="s2">capture sort of dynamic combined with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.909" end="00:21:26.270" style="s2">predisposition from any of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.770" end="00:21:30.350" style="s2">internet enclaves to really adhere to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.270" end="00:21:33.830" style="s2">the type of content that sort of is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.350" end="00:21:35.390" style="s2">de-facto produced on Dave&#39;s channel and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.830" end="00:21:36.710" style="s2">I think that there is a bit of a feeding</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.390" end="00:21:39.320" style="s2">frenzy going on and I&#39;m sort of trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.710" end="00:21:41.450" style="s2">to be careful not to devolve into the ad</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.320" end="00:21:43.429" style="s2">homonyms to restate that I think he and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.450" end="00:21:46.309" style="s2">I could have a really great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.429" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">which I maintain my openness to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.309" end="00:21:53.030" style="s2">participate in and sort of leave it at</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:54.980" style="s2">that I also want to sort of take it out</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.030" end="00:21:57.590" style="s2">a little bit to say so he&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.980" end="00:21:59.780" style="s2">been being challenged quite a bit and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.590" end="00:22:03.320" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s quite a lot of critiques</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.780" end="00:22:04.940" style="s2">of Dave out there already and it this</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.320" end="00:22:08.090" style="s2">seems to be a feature of the polarized</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.940" end="00:22:10.429" style="s2">landscape as well I know like Sam cedar</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.090" end="00:22:13.549" style="s2">for example and I think Michael Brooks</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.429" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">on Sam cedar show there&#39;s quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.549" end="00:22:15.590" style="s2">and Anna Anna</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:17.540" style="s2">ana kasparian as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.590" end="00:22:21.860" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a lot of critiques of Dave</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.540" end="00:22:24.260" style="s2">that in a way I can see that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.860" end="00:22:27.290" style="s2">audience of those shows wants people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.260" end="00:22:28.850" style="s2">beat up on Dave Rubin so that becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.290" end="00:22:31.640" style="s2">the tone of those critiques seems to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.850" end="00:22:33.380" style="s2">become more and more combative and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.640" end="00:22:34.850" style="s2">the chances for any kind of dialogue are</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.380" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">the chances of Dave sort of being able</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.850" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">to say well yeah I&#39;ll let out I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:42.140" style="s2">welcome these people onto my show then</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:44.120" style="s2">seems to to deteriorate massively</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.140" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">because of the tone of those critiques</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.120" end="00:22:48.230" style="s2">do you see what I mean like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:51.320" style="s2">polarization seems to make good faith</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.230" end="00:22:54.500" style="s2">dialog even more difficult absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.320" end="00:22:56.750" style="s2">mean on the one hand why are some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.500" end="00:22:58.130" style="s2">these voices not being interviewed by</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.750" end="00:23:00.350" style="s2">Dave Rubin but on the other hand I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.130" end="00:23:03.770" style="s2">completely see why he would not be</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.350" end="00:23:07.180" style="s2">inclined to bring voices on that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.770" end="00:23:10.010" style="s2">sort of levying harsher and harsher</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.180" end="00:23:12.350" style="s2">criticisms against him in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.010" end="00:23:14.660" style="s2">tone as it goes sort of like above and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.350" end="00:23:18.470" style="s2">beyond the fact so that&#39;s why I&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.660" end="00:23:20.600" style="s2">know I have a track record that is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.470" end="00:23:22.760" style="s2">something to brag about it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.600" end="00:23:24.530" style="s2">reality of being able to have civil</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.760" end="00:23:25.880" style="s2">conversation with almost anybody now</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.530" end="00:23:27.560" style="s2">sometimes when I say that people will</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.880" end="00:23:29.300" style="s2">write to me and say David it&#39;s no big</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.560" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">accomplishment to be able to calmly talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.300" end="00:23:33.830" style="s2">to Nazis right and it&#39;s not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:35.690" style="s2">citing it as an accomplishment in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.830" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">sense I mention it in order to be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.690" end="00:23:40.760" style="s2">to say although I have these differences</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">with Dave Rubin or with whoever with ben</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.760" end="00:23:46.280" style="s2">shapiro or name anybody if we decide hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:48.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to sit down and really</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.280" end="00:23:50.810" style="s2">figure out where do we agree where do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.440" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">disagree what are the lines of this sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.810" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">of this debate assuming that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.710" end="00:23:59.240" style="s2">evolve into personal attacks against me</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:01.340" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have no problem carrying that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.240" end="00:24:02.990" style="s2">out in a civil way we&#39;re really the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.340" end="00:24:06.650" style="s2">focus is going to be substance rather</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.990" end="00:24:09.920" style="s2">than attacks or tone or whatever so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.650" end="00:24:13.070" style="s2">tried to make it clear that these are my</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.920" end="00:24:16.310" style="s2">disagreements with Dave Rubin in terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.070" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">of what he&#39;s putting out on online but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.310" end="00:24:20.450" style="s2">would sort of relish the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.040" style="s2">respectfully figure out where is he</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.450" end="00:24:23.540" style="s2">coming from on these things you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.040" end="00:24:24.860" style="s2">last conversation I had with him as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.540" end="00:24:26.210" style="s2">mentioned was this hour interview I did</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.860" end="00:24:28.909" style="s2">with him at this point it might be two</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.210" end="00:24:30.649" style="s2">years ago or more so I completely on</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.909" end="00:24:33.109" style="s2">understand why as people become more</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.649" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">sort of virulent in their critiques why</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.109" end="00:24:38.809" style="s2">he would be disinclined to allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">participate on his program that being</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.809" end="00:24:45.049" style="s2">said I also am unsure why someone for</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:47.749" style="s2">example who is openly homophobic or</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.049" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">anti-semitic which relates to two you</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.749" end="00:24:55.159" style="s2">know identities that that Dave Rubin is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">part of why they would be I see that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.159" end="00:24:59.299" style="s2">see platforming that without serious</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:00.979" style="s2">challenges just as problematic as sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.299" end="00:25:02.899" style="s2">of keeping out broad swaths of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.979" end="00:25:06.049" style="s2">political spectrum yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.899" end="00:25:08.210" style="s2">something quite ironic I I find in in</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.049" end="00:25:09.979" style="s2">what&#39;s going on at the moment and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.210" end="00:25:11.960" style="s2">bringing in sort of Ben Shapiro here as</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.979" end="00:25:15.470" style="s2">well in in his criticisms of Andrew Neil</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.960" end="00:25:19.129" style="s2">and that there is almost a mirror image</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.470" end="00:25:22.909" style="s2">of what they accuse the left or social</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.129" end="00:25:26.509" style="s2">justice warriors of doing of tone</p>

<p begin="00:25:28.279" end="00:25:32.929" style="s2">going to be constructive and that feels</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.919" end="00:25:35.479" style="s2">very ironic like that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.929" end="00:25:36.769" style="s2">very that there is there is something</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.479" end="00:25:39.950" style="s2">that&#39;s very similar about those two</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.769" end="00:25:41.629" style="s2">perspectives yeah and I&#39;d love to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.950" end="00:25:44.450" style="s2">the opportunity to really explore that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.629" end="00:25:46.489" style="s2">in in in some detail for sure I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.450" end="00:25:48.950" style="s2">being against identity politics but then</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.489" end="00:25:51.499" style="s2">making identity arguments or being</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.950" end="00:25:53.479" style="s2">against sort of limiting the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.499" end="00:25:55.639" style="s2">voices or the ideas that are heard but</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.479" end="00:25:58.119" style="s2">then not sort of actively pursuing more</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.639" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">diversity of voices in in those ways and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.119" end="00:26:04.849" style="s2">you know I do think that in without</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.470" style="s2">inviting me on anyone&#39;s program I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.849" end="00:26:08.269" style="s2">that there would be a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.470" end="00:26:09.979" style="s2">conversation to have with whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.269" end="00:26:13.609" style="s2">Dave or whether it&#39;s Ben Shapiro or</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.979" end="00:26:15.409" style="s2">whoever about what I perceived to be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.609" end="00:26:17.599" style="s2">contradiction as far as that goes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.409" end="00:26:18.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve made some video clips on my channel</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.599" end="00:26:20.539" style="s2">about those those apparent</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.889" end="00:26:21.979" style="s2">contradictions and I think it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.539" end="00:26:25.399" style="s2">great conversation to have and it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.979" end="00:26:28.489" style="s2">not be a bad faith conversation I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.399" end="00:26:30.590" style="s2">genuinely am interested in if someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.489" end="00:26:32.929" style="s2">says identity politics is bad how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.590" end="00:26:35.479" style="s2">they justify making identity arguments</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.929" end="00:26:38.359" style="s2">you know I feel as though my view on</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.479" end="00:26:41.599" style="s2">identity politics is relatively nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.359" end="00:26:42.300" style="s2">which is using identity as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.599" end="00:26:46.170" style="s2">cudgel</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.300" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">to suppress voices and to say only those</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.170" end="00:26:50.790" style="s2">who check a certain box should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:52.620" style="s2">listened to or primarily should be the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.790" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">ones listened to I&#39;m against that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.620" end="00:26:58.710" style="s2">but it would also be ignorant to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:27:01.590" style="s2">the reality that one&#39;s identity relates</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.710" end="00:27:04.890" style="s2">to their experience in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.590" end="00:27:07.080" style="s2">thus there may be some special value or</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.890" end="00:27:09.510" style="s2">particular value in considering that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.080" end="00:27:11.310" style="s2">when we are exploring what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.510" end="00:27:12.780" style="s2">doing as humans on this planet in terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.310" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">of figuring out the problems that face</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.780" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">us are you familiar with Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:19.980" style="s2">heights work very much so yes and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:22.950" style="s2">interviewed him in read recently read</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.980" end="00:27:24.600" style="s2">the there is it the righteous mind the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.950" end="00:27:26.250" style="s2">coddling of the American mind is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.600" end="00:27:28.200" style="s2">most recent one the righteous mind is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.250" end="00:27:30.570" style="s2">about how good people are divided by</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.200" end="00:27:32.490" style="s2">politics that&#39;s the one I read yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.570" end="00:27:35.610" style="s2">I mean I think his work is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.490" end="00:27:37.860" style="s2">crucial to to understanding if if</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.610" end="00:27:39.450" style="s2">political belief is largely based on</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.860" end="00:27:41.970" style="s2">temperament then we have to keep talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.450" end="00:27:44.250" style="s2">to each other and the separation into</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.970" end="00:27:48.570" style="s2">armed camps which is what seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.250" end="00:27:52.620" style="s2">happening through the kind of WL</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.570" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">sense-making wmd of social media seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.620" end="00:27:57.920" style="s2">to be one of the most existential</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:28:00.570" style="s2">threats that we&#39;re we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.920" end="00:28:02.280" style="s2">absolutely and privately I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.570" end="00:28:04.140" style="s2">talking to a lot of people about what</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.280" end="00:28:05.940" style="s2">are some techniques that have actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.140" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">been able to sort of open the door to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.940" end="00:28:10.860" style="s2">these cross party lines conversations</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:12.450" style="s2">and there you know are some specific</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.860" end="00:28:14.070" style="s2">techniques that I&#39;ve come across which I</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.450" end="00:28:16.200" style="s2">think are useful which I&#39;m glad to talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.070" end="00:28:17.910" style="s2">about but maybe are not really the scope</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.200" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">of our conversation today but I do</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.910" end="00:28:23.970" style="s2">believe that there are lots of ways that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:26.310" style="s2">these conversations can happen and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.970" end="00:28:29.580" style="s2">think it&#39;s undeniable that social media</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.310" end="00:28:31.110" style="s2">is not facilitating any of that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.580" end="00:28:33.780" style="s2">certainly be interested if you were able</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.110" end="00:28:35.370" style="s2">to run through them fairly quickly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.780" end="00:28:36.990" style="s2">I mean just a couple of ideas and some</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.370" end="00:28:38.820" style="s2">of these I employ them on my program</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.990" end="00:28:41.490" style="s2">when I have adversarial callers I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.820" end="00:28:43.740" style="s2">one thing is a great basis for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.490" end="00:28:46.920" style="s2">conversation between people who disagree</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.740" end="00:28:49.350" style="s2">is asking the other person to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.920" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">read back to you or to explain to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.350" end="00:28:53.490" style="s2">what do they perceive your position to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:54.840" style="s2">be and maybe more importantly why do</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.490" end="00:28:55.910" style="s2">they think you&#39;ve arrived at that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.840" end="00:28:57.980" style="s2">position so for it</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.910" end="00:29:00.140" style="s2">ample health care debates can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.980" end="00:29:03.350" style="s2">extraordinarily divisive just to take an</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.140" end="00:29:05.890" style="s2">issue like that I am on the left and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.350" end="00:29:08.450" style="s2">believe that some sort of single-payer</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.890" end="00:29:09.860" style="s2">nationalized or otherwise universal</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:11.720" style="s2">system is the way forward although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.860" end="00:29:15.380" style="s2">relatively agnostic about the specifics</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.720" end="00:29:17.570" style="s2">rather than just like diving into a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.380" end="00:29:19.280" style="s2">heated conversation about that with</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.570" end="00:29:21.710" style="s2">someone who thinks the market system is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.280" end="00:29:24.170" style="s2">best if I asked them listen you know my</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.710" end="00:29:26.390" style="s2">position why do you think I have my</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.170" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">position how do what what what led me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.390" end="00:29:30.380" style="s2">arrive at my position if they are good</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">faith participants which will be very</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.380" end="00:29:36.110" style="s2">quickly exposed by a question like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.440" end="00:29:37.850" style="s2">merely by reading back to me why they</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.110" end="00:29:40.970" style="s2">think I believe what I believe they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.850" end="00:29:43.340" style="s2">going to be significantly predisposed to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.970" end="00:29:45.320" style="s2">listen to my ideas because they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.340" end="00:29:47.270" style="s2">probably going to attribute good faith</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.320" end="00:29:48.800" style="s2">reasons to how I arrived at my</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.270" end="00:29:50.390" style="s2">conclusion they might say well listen</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.800" end="00:29:51.950" style="s2">you probably think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.390" end="00:29:54.440" style="s2">efficient way to get the best care to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.950" end="00:29:56.540" style="s2">the most number of people if someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.440" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">just says that that is instantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.540" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">changing the tone and the tenor of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.930" style="s2">conversation away in a way that I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">is very positive I tend to follow that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.930" end="00:30:05.750" style="s2">up with given your position on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.060" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.750" end="00:30:09.800" style="s2">what evidence if I was able to present</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.060" end="00:30:11.510" style="s2">it to you would would change your mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.800" end="00:30:13.490" style="s2">and this is something I first heard from</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.510" end="00:30:14.870" style="s2">Peter Boghossian the de feasibility test</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.490" end="00:30:18.110" style="s2">although I&#39;ve seen it from others as</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.870" end="00:30:20.330" style="s2">well just those two questions to set up</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.110" end="00:30:23.000" style="s2">a conversation about most political</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.330" end="00:30:24.950" style="s2">issues will significantly include the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.000" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">chances of it being productive and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.950" end="00:30:29.240" style="s2">of actually making some progress on</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:30.950" style="s2">these issues it&#39;s interesting so we as I</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.240" end="00:30:33.050" style="s2">said we featured the intellectual dart</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.950" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">web quite a lot and there&#39;s some talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.050" end="00:30:40.400" style="s2">about what it is and whether there could</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:43.880" style="s2">be a kind of IDW protocol for good-faith</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.400" end="00:30:45.800" style="s2">conversation that that and that I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.880" end="00:30:47.450" style="s2">could be part of it I think steel</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.800" end="00:30:49.370" style="s2">Manning is something that Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.450" end="00:30:51.410" style="s2">talks about which is kind of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.370" end="00:30:53.930" style="s2">talking about in your what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.410" end="00:30:55.370" style="s2">saying is can you restate back to me my</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.930" end="00:30:58.400" style="s2">own argument in a way that I&#39;ll agree</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.370" end="00:31:00.470" style="s2">with I I think that there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.400" end="00:31:03.920" style="s2">significant overlap in the ideas yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.470" end="00:31:06.650" style="s2">from my perspective sort of I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.920" end="00:31:08.090" style="s2">about what is the the other side of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:13.850" style="s2">I think it is something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.880" end="00:31:16.280" style="s2">appreciating that everyone has values</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.850" end="00:31:17.870" style="s2">that are important and Jonathan heights</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.760" end="00:31:34.340" style="s2">that there&#39;s a sense that any ID on any</p>
