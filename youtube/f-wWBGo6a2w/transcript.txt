The Psychological Significance of the "Bible" Story The first introduction to the concept of "God" Jordan B. Peterson
 The translations used in this subtitle when referring to the original text of the "Bible" are based on the "Mandarin Chinese Union Version" ("God" version)
 The Psychological Significance of "Bible" Stories Dr. Jordan B. Peterson First Lecture May 16, 2017
 Thank you all for coming
 What surprised me was
 Everyone really has nothing to do on Tuesday night
 It's really weird in a way
 So many people come to listen
 A series of lectures on the psychological significance of "Bible" stories
 I have wanted to do this for a long time
 But what surprised me was that someone would be willing to listen
 That’s great, let’s take one step at a time
 I want to start with this because the question is very reasonable
 Why bother to do this
 I don’t mean why you should take this effort
 I have my own reasons
 But you might think
 Why bother with this strange ancient book
 This is a good question
 This contradictory document has been pieced together into a book for thousands of years
 It survives beyond countless kingdoms
 This is really interesting. A book is tougher than a rock
 It can withstand the test of time than castles and empires
 This is really interesting
 Something so fleeting will last so long
 So this is like a mystery
 This is how I look at the "Bible" story
 They are like a mystery
 Because basically they are
 There are many things we don’t understand
 We don't know how they came from
 We don’t understand how they pieced together
 We don't know why
 They will have such an incredible influence on civilization
 We don’t understand why people still believe these stories
 We don’t know what it means to not believe them now
 Or we don’t even know
 If we believe what these stories mean
 There is another problem
 This question is not limited to me but must be related to me
 That is no matter how high your education is
 You can't accumulate enough knowledge to discuss
 The Psychological Significance in the Story of the Bible
 But i will do my best
 Partly because I want to learn more about them
 as far as I know
 One of the best ways to learn something is to tell
 I am also thinking during my lecture
 I'm not trying to tell you the facts I am convinced
 Because there are many things I'm not sure about
 I'm just trying to clarify the truth
 And I’ve been doing this for a long time
 You may or may not know that I admire Nietzsche
 Nietzsche is a powerful critic of dogmatic Christianity
 This refers to the situation when Christianity was realized by institutions
 Yet he is a paradoxical thinker
 Nietzsche once said such a thing
 He doesn’t believe if it’s not because of Christianity
 The scientific revolution will begin or succeed
 To be precise, this refers to Catholicism
 He believes that in the course of a thousand years of history
 Europeans have trained their way of thinking into
 Explain everything in
 In a single coherent framework
 If you accept the initial axiom, it is coherent
 A single coherent framework
 Nietzsche believed that the Catholicization of life and historical phenomena
 Gave birth to a way of thinking that can surpass
 Its dogmatic foundation and focus on other things
 In this case it happens to be the natural world
 Nietzsche felt that Christianity was buried in his own hands
 And it took a long time to try to go
 Make people aware of the need for truth
 Keep people from falling
 And the fall is often part of human attempts
 The spirit of truth is developed from Christianity
 But it also counteracts the foundation of Christianity
 Everyone mutters or thinks after waking up
 Why do we start to believe these things
 It's like one day you wake up and find
 You really don’t know why a Christmas tree is erected
 But you have been doing this for a long time
 And this is often the behavior of people
 The Christmas tree appeared for a reason
 After the cause is forgotten, the ceremony still exists
 Nietzsche is not only a critic of Christianity
 Is also a champion of its discipline
 Another thing Nietzsche agrees with is
 You cannot be free if you were not a slave
 He meant to say
 You will not leap from childhood to mature adult personality
 You will move from childhood to a state of discipline
 This can be understood as similar to self-imposed slavery
 This will be the best situation
 Before you can regain the generality of childhood
 You must discipline yourself to be a certain individual
 He believes that Christianity is
 Played such a role for Western civilization
 But at the end of the 19th century he declared "God is dead"
 You will often hear this sentence in a triumphant tone
 But not for Nietzsche
 He is far from such a simple thinker
 Nietzsche is clear and this is what I want to clarify
 That’s the structure of experience we still don’t know much
 We don't understand reality
 What we have is a clear statement of the world
 We know nothing beyond this
 There is a buffer zone in this
 This is what we seem to know
 But we don’t have a clear understanding of it
 for example
 When you are arguing with your relatives and friends, it coincides with a low mood
 They become sensitive, irritable and unreasonable
 If you keep talking
 They may suddenly stand up and even cry
 When they started crying
 They can understand why they are angry
 And it's not because of you
 Although you might have caused this controversy
 In my opinion this is a very interesting phenomenon
 Because it means that people can understand others to a certain extent
 But it is difficult to express in words
 In a sense, the mind is sublimated from the body
 It affects emotional video and behavior
 Before we recognize a thing clearly
 I can already understand it on a certain level
 We have a space that can be clearly explained
 Where we can discuss everything
 But outside of this we are in contact with
 Something similar to a dream we will get stuck in it
 What we are trapped in is an emotional dream
 And it is based at least in part on our behavior
 I will describe this later
 We don’t know anything beyond this part
 This dream is where the mystics and artists live
 They are the medium between the omniscience and the unknown
 This means that what we know is based on
 The form of knowledge that we don’t actually understand
 If the two are not consistent
 If we can articulate the knowledge
 If it's out of sync with our dreams
 Then we will tear from the inside
 What we think, what we do, what we don’t dream
 This will cause a mental disorder
 This mental disorder
 And its antidote is something like a
 Belief and representation
 People will turn to things like ideology
 This seems to me to be attached to
 Parasites based on underlying religion
 In order to organize their thoughts
 This disaster was what Nietzsche had foreseen
 He realized
 When we destroy representations
 When stripping away the foundation of Western civilization
 This representation refers to the ideal model of God
 We will become unstable
 Sway between nihilism and ideological extremes
 He is especially concerned about the radical left ideology
 And it was predicted as early as the end of the 19th century
 This is really a shocking insight
 There will be hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century
 It is precisely because it replaces this dreamlike structure that is hidden at the bottom
 Replaced by rational
 But the extremely wrong way of expressing the world
 We have been swinging back and forth between left and right ever since
 With sporadic nihilism and despair
 In a sense, this is the situation of modern Westerners
 All humanity is gradually falling into it
 I think islam
 Part of the reason for being hostile to the West is
 There are many other reasons and not all of them are justified
 It is certain that one of the reasons is
 Because they are still based on dreams
 So they can see that the West has nothing to trust
 Doubtful thinking
 And this threatens the integrity of their culture
 And it is true
 We westerners have been racking our brains to destroy the Great Wall
 I'm not complaining
 It’s not easy to deal with this situation
 But this disaster is not without results
 It has a real impact on people’s lives
 This is not very abstract
 For example, I have seen and treated many times
 Found in patients with depression or anxiety
 They are all in an existential crisis
 This is not just as simple as mental illness
 Their abnormality is not only caused by neurochemical disorders
 Although sometimes it happens to be the reason
 And the reason is that they have been
 Overwhelmed by the pain and complexity of his life
 And they are not sure if it makes sense to continue
 You can feel the bad negative meaning in life
 So I doubt that I believe it has any positive meaning
 I have a client who is a very good artist
 As long as he doesn't think, he's fine
 He will create
 And he is really good at his job
 His personality is to keep creating great products
 But he always underestimates himself
 Self-destruct
 But when he started thinking about what he did
 It seems to use a drill, saw or similar to break the road
 He will start to criticize what he did
 Think his job is useless
 Although the value of his work is obvious
 So he found it difficult to find motivation to create
 As a reason and being
 A great example of the consequences of a split in some way
 He impressed me
 He split to truly doubt his own existence value
 This is really not a joke
 Its seriousness lies in what it shows
 Not only an individual's mental illness
 And it's also a mental illness of society
 The tendency of people to get involved in ideology
 In my opinion it is a lame religion
 This is the right way to understand them
 They are like a religion lacking arms and legs
 But still forge ahead
 It creates a sense of security and group identity
 But it’s deformed and crazily surly
 And parasitic on some potential richness and reality
 In short, this is how I look at it
 I think it’s important to solve this problem
 I think nothing
 It's more urgent than this
 I have been thinking about this for a long, long time
 I have been researching since the 80s
 The belief system is regulating
 Role in mental and social health
 You can realize that it does work
 Because when you challenge people’s belief systems
 They will be really upset
 Why do they care so much
 Even your ideological principles
 What if it is completely correct
 Let’s put it this way when people’s ideological principles are pointed out
 Will become very angry
 Even if I exhaust my imagination, I can’t find the obvious reason
 They are based on a basic truth
 They are like on a raft in the middle of the sea
 When you start to pull the wooden slats from the raft
 They will be afraid of falling and drowning
 What drowned
 What is the raft protecting them from?
 Why they are so afraid
 Beyond the boundaries of ideology
 These are not obvious things
 I have tried to solve this mystery for a long time
 There are some videos of my lectures on this topic on YouTube
 Most of you know it
 Part of the content in this series of lectures
 You have heard of it
 If you watch those videos
 But I want to try to explain from some other angles
 Nietzsche’s view is human
 Is to create its own value
 He knows we all have bodies
 Motivation and emotion
 In a way he is a romantic thinker
 But far beyond his time
 He understands our ability to think
 Not a free floating soul
 But is deeply rooted in our physiology
 Subject to our emotions
 Shaped by our motivation and body
 He understands this
 But he also believes that the only way to solve the problem
 For us humans, it becomes close to God
 And create its own value
 He will create his own value
 Called "Superman"
 This is what the Nazis used to arm their superior national ideologies
 Nietzsche's philosophy
 We all know what happened
 Obviously nothing good happened
 I also spent a lot of time reading a lot of Carl Jung’s books
 It is through him
 And Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist
 I just started to realize our clear thought system
 Is deeply rooted in something like a dream
 This dream is through a complicated way
 Affected by our behavior
 We often don’t understand what we show through our actions
 If this is not true
 We don’t need psychology, sociology or anthropology
 These are unnecessary
 Because we have fully understood ourselves
 And obviously we are not
 We are far more complicated than we know
 This means that in our behavior
 There are too many things we don’t know
 A part of the dream that surrounds us with clear cognition
 Formed by observing each other’s behavior
 And tell it into a story and pass it on to all generations
 Extract the behavioral patterns that shape human nature
 And try to show it
 Partly through imitation
 But also through drama, mythology, literature and art, etc.
 Show what we are like
 So we can understand what we are like
 This is what I read from the "Bible" story
 At least part of the cognitive process shown in the Bible
 It is hesitant, one-sided, clumsy and contradictory
 This is one of the reasons that makes this book complicated
 But from it I also interpret that humanity is in the animal ancestors
 The struggle has found a way out
 Then realized what it means to be human
 And this is a very difficult thing
 Because we don't know who we are
 What are we or where do we come from
 Life is an uninterrupted chain
 Can be traced back to 3.5 billion years ago
 It's pretty incredible
 The ancestors of everyone here
 Have successfully reproduced for 3.5 billion years
 It's pretty incredible
 We grow from the soil and silt
 Become what it is now
 We realized but failed to know
 And try to figure out who we are
 A series of stories we have told for 3000 years
 It seems to me that there is a deep meaning
 When I study the "Bible" story to some extent
 Started with a beginner mentality
 This book is really a mystery how it was made into a book
 Why should it be written and why should we save it
 Why does it happen to inspire a culture
 For two thousand years and changed the world
 What happened and how did it happen
 It can't be obvious
 There is one thing in the sloppy comments on religion that bothers me
 That is they don’t take this phenomenon seriously
 This is a serious phenomenon
 Especially because people have the ability to get religious experience
 But no one knows the reason
 You can stimulate religious experience in various reliable ways
 You can do it by stimulating the brain
 Of course it can also be achieved through drugs, especially psychedelics
 It can induce a close union with the divine very frequently
 Only God knows how long people have used hallucinogenic drugs
 It's about 50,000 years, maybe even longer
 It is used to induce a
 A close connection with the divine
 We don't know anything about it
 When we discovered psychedelic drugs in the late 1960s
 It shocked everyone deeply
 So that it was immediately classified as illegal
 And it is forbidden to use it for research for nearly 50 years
 It’s no wonder because no one can think of it
 Jung was a scholar of Nietzsche
 But he is also a sharp critic of Nietzsche
 He was cultivated by Freud
 Freud began to collect the information we have
 This information is about the concept of people living in dreams
 It was Freud who polarized the subconscious view
 Now we take it for granted to a point
 So that we don't realize
 How revolutionary this view was at the time
 For Freud's ideas
 We used to go to the rough
 Now when we mention Freud, we only consider his fur
 Because this is the part that was abandoned
 But many of his discoveries
 Have become part of our current popular concepts
 Include a point of view
 That is your perception, behavior and thought
 Are all influenced and shaped by subconscious motives
 But not under your control
 It's so weird
 This is the psychoanalytic theory
 One of the most disturbing things
 Psychoanalytic theory can be understood like this
 You are a loose collection of active sub-personality
 Each of them has its own set
 Motivation, perception of emotion and logical basis
 And you have limited control over them
 You are like a collection
 Inside are some loosely assembled personalities
 You know it well
 Because you can't control yourself well
 This is what Jung argued for Nietzsche
 Refutation of the view that "we can create our own value"
 Jung did not believe this
 Especially after breaking with Freud
 Because he realized that human beings are deeply affected by
 Influenced by something outside the control of subjective consciousness
 No one really knows how to define these things
 Cognitive psychologists identify it as a computing machine
 The ancients understood it as a deity
 Although the facts are more complicated
 Mars is considered the god of anger
 When you are angry you will be possessed by him
 This makes sense and it says what I want to say
 This may be when you notice
 What you want to say doesn't matter much
 It's not only in you, everyone has
 And it will last forever and even exist in animals
 This is a transcendent mental entity
 It was born in a whole nation
 Just as a thought occupies the brain
 This is a way to interpret it
 This is a very strange way of thinking
 But it does have its advantages
 These things are gods in a sense
 But it's not that simple
 Jung is very interested in dreams
 Then he began to understand the relationship between dreams and myths
 Then he found his client’s dream
 Always echoes the fairy tales
 He once studied mythology deeply
 He began to believe that dreams are the birthplace of myths
 There is a continuous interaction between these two programs
 From dream to story to narrative
 When you can remember the dream, you can tell it as a story
 Some people can remember all the dreams he had
 There can be two or three in one night
 I have had customers like this
 They often have prototype dreams with a clear mythological framework
 I think this situation is
 More common among creative people
 Especially when they were not emotionally stable at the time
 Because dreams always tend to
 Take up uncertain space
 And focus on what you haven’t really understood
 To visualize an unknown reality
 So dreams are the birthplace of myths
 This is a good angle of thinking
 Because it is not so clear
 It is trying to define something
 Jung has a concept called "post-Freud"
 There is a hidden dream
 Internal review mechanism for true information
 Jung didn’t think so
 He believes that dreams express reality to the best of their ability
 And this is still fully articulate
 Perceptible understanding
 Think about it, don’t you think an idea came to mind?
 It's obvious
 Bang this is something you never wanted
 What does this mean
 Just a thought that flashed through my mind
 This explanation is ridiculous too
 There is no use at all, where did the idea come from
 Oh nowhere just appeared
 It seems that this is really not a strict explanation
 You may think about the ideas you have in mind
 So where did these ideas come from
 They are often the thoughts of other people
 People who have been dead for a long time
 Partly like this
 Like the words you use to think
 From the mouth of someone who has long since passed away
 You are under the influence of your ancestors
 This is a way to understand it
 Your motivation emotion
 And the body are communicating with you
 And these are achieved through dreams
 Dreams are the birthplace of ideas that can be fully expressed
 They are not rootless trees
 They all have a developmental origin
 And only God knows how long that origin is
 Even for example, I said "I am conscious"
 Chimps don’t even say that
 About 7 million years ago
 We parted ways with the chimpanzees from the common ancestor
 They have no knowledge that can be articulated
 Almost no self-expression ability
 There is almost no self-awareness and we are not at all like this
 In the course of 7 million years
 We must work hard to figure out all this
 I think a part of it is an ancient story
 Performance and record
 I think especially the oldest stories in "Genesis"
 This is what we are going to start deciphering
 Some ancient natures of mankind
 Are included in these stories
 In my opinion they are very enlightening
 Give a simple example
 There is a concept of "sacrifice" in the Old Testament
 Quite brutal
 The story of Abraham and Isaac is a good example
 Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son
 This is not like a
 What a reasonable god can make
 God in the Old Testament
 It is often cruel, ruthless and arbitrary
 This is what gives this book life
 It is certainly not edited by a committee
 Because a committee will consider to avoid offending anyone
 In short, Jung believes that dreams are the birthplace of thoughts
 I have been expanding this idea
 Because there is something that makes me curious
 You have a dream and then find someone to interpret the dream
 You can dispute the correctness of the explanation
 Just as you can argue about the explanation of a movie or novel
 It’s really hard to judge its accuracy
 This is also part of the reason for the criticism of postmodernism
 According to my observation, people will show a dream
 And then we can occasionally
 Extract real and useful information
 But this person doesn't seem to know
 But there was a glimmer of insight
 For me this is a signal
 Mark something we accidentally discovered
 That is before someone
 Split something combined
 It can reround the broken mirror
 Like a good story
 Or a good theory can do the same
 Things are all at once
 At the same time a small light
 This is what I use at home
 Signals to determine accuracy and dream interpretation
 When I was just married
 I often quarrel with my wife
 I'm very impatient in my heart
 Then I will shoot the case
 Get upset about what we are arguing about
 Then she will go to sleep, which is really maddening
 I'm annoying why I can't sleep
 Gnawing nails in a hurry
 And she was asleep beside me
 I'm really going crazy
 But she often dreams
 We will discuss her dream the next morning
 We can solve the crux of the previous argument
 This is really very useful
 Even though it was so quarrelsome before
 So I was convinced by Jung
 Tell me about his dreams, myths, dramas and literature
 View of the connection
 Makes sense to me
 The same goes for his views on the relationship between people and art
 I know an aboriginal sculptor
 He is a Kwakwajakwa tribe
 His works include
 Wood carving totem poles and masks, etc.
 I also collected some at home
 He is a very interesting person
 Almost illiterate
 And focus on
 This ancient tradition that has continued for 13,000 years
 He speaks the original language
 And he is illiterate
 Makes him think a bit like
 People who lived in the pre-writing period
 People in the pre-text period are not stupid
 They just can't read
 Their brain organization is very different from ours
 I once asked him where his carving inspiration came from
 He told me that I got it through dreaming
 You have all seen Haida masks
 Know what it looks like
 His ethnicity is closely related to the Haida ethnic group
 Basically the same style
 He said he would dream about animals and remember dreams
 He was still talking to his grandparents in his dream
 They will teach him how to carve
 This happens often if he encounters problems in carving
 His grandparents will appear in the dream
 He will discuss the problem
 In his eyes the animals he wants to carve
 Is to live vividly in imagination
 It’s not difficult to understand. First of all I have no reason not to believe him
 He is a very upright person
 And I don’t think he has any motivation or scheming
 To make up a story like this
 He doesn't make sense to do this
 I don’t think he will talk to others everywhere
 Because he also thought it was a bit crazy
 When he was a kid he thought he was crazy
 Because he always dreams of these animals
 He is not what he wants to show off
 It makes me very fascinated
 Because i can recognize
 Shows an unbroken tradition in him
 We don’t know this tradition at all
 How did it pass on for thousands of years
 Partly by oral delivery and memory
 Partly by performing it in a theatrical form
 Part of it depends on imagination
 How illiterate people store knowledge
 Totally different from us
 We don't remember anything
 We all write in the book
 But if you come from an oral traditional culture
 Especially if you have been trained in oral tradition
 You will have all the information in your head
 So that you can speak
 Then you can tell these stories
 And can really understand them
 Modern people can't think of what's going on
 I suspect that there may not be more than two of you
 Able to recite 30 lines of poems fluently
 The purpose of poetry is to enable people to recite
 This is why we have such a literary form
 So that people can memorize it and keep it in their minds at any time
 But now we don’t do it anymore
 Closer to home, let's go back to Jung
 Jung values ​​the value of dreams very much
 I know dreams can tell what you don't know
 How is this possible
 What do you think of
 Tell what you don't know
 How can it make sense
 First of all why can't you understand it
 Why is it displayed in the form of a dream
 It’s like there is something in your body
 Things you can't control
 Dreams look like real life to you
 There is a strange kind of person who can have lucid dreams
 In other words, they can remain partly conscious in their dreams
 But most of the time you are lying down and sleeping
 And this crazy and complicated world is inside you
 Showing but you don't know how it happened
 You can't do it when you are awake
 And you don't know what it means
 What exactly is going on
 This is what you can learn from psychoanalysts
 Such a terrible thing
 You can see it from Freud and Jung
 You will start to really recognize
 Something in you is controlling you
 Instead of you controlling them
 You can do a little bit of mutual control
 But there is always some kind of "spirit" display
 Let's just say so
 The spirit in your body determines your behavior
 Just spend your life like this and you can't control it
 What is this? Is it random?
 Some people claim dreams
 It’s just the result of a random reflex
 I think this theory is really nonsense
 Because dreams are not random events at all
 Dreams are very organized and very complicated
 It's not like snowflakes on the TV screen
 Or the noise on the radio is actually quite complicated
 I often see people who can dream a series of very coherent dreams
 These dreams have a complete narrative structure
 To some extent, they are very mature stories
 So that theory doesn’t make sense to me
 I think it's useless to say that
 So I want to take this phenomenon seriously
 There is such a situation in my dream
 You dreamed of the future and you managed to realize it
 It seems not a trivial matter
 Or you had a nightmare and then realized it
 Because people do
 Like if they are determined to get revenge
 And full of resentment and hatred
 These will show up in bad fantasies
 Dream first and then people put it into action
 It is full of power
 The whole nation can be involved in the collective dream
 This is what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s
 That is really an extraordinary sight that shocked the world
 The same thing happened in the Soviet Union and other places
 You have to take these things seriously
 You need to find ways to figure out what happened
 What Jung thought the dream might contain
 More than clearly understood so far
 I think the artist is doing the same thing
 People go to the museum to admire the paintings
 Whether it’s Renaissance painting or modern painting
 They are not very clear about the appearance of these paintings
 I've been to a museum in New York filled with Renaissance art
 Are all great painters and even the greatest
 I think the collection in that room may be worth a billion dollars
 Even its value far exceeds this
 Because there are about 20 paintings that are priceless
 First of all, there is a question because these paintings are so valuable
 Why in the largest city in the world
 Will build an exhibition hall for these paintings
 Why people from all over the world
 Want to visit here
 What are they doing
 One of the paintings is "Assumption of the Virgin", which is beautifully painted
 What a shining artwork
 There are about 20 people standing in front of this painting and watching
 What are they doing they don't know
 Why do they go to the Holy Land in New York
 Visit the painting specially
 They don't seem to understand
 Why is this painting so valuable
 I know the status of this painting is extraordinary
 But this raises another question
 Why is this item's status so high
 What is so extraordinary about them
 We are weird creatures
 I tried to figure it out
 Where did the information in the dream come from
 Must have its source
 You can think of it as a revelation
 Because it's like something out of nothing
 And contains new knowledge and enlightenment
 You didn't make it, it just appeared
 This is one thing I want to take seriously
 I am a person with scientific thinking
 And I'm still a very rational person
 Before I seek any other type of explanation
 I tend to explain things with reason and experience
 I'm not talking about everything related to divinity
 Can be resolved
 It can be resolved into another form
 Such as the evolutionary history of biology, etc.
 But as long as it can be resolved
 I will do it
 But I will keep other phenomena in a metaphysical state
 Because they cannot be defined
 In this category
 I will define it as mystical and religious experience
 These are things we don’t understand at all
 The artists will observe each other as well as people
 And then they show what they see
 And pass this information to us
 It taught us how to see and observe
 We don't necessarily know
 What we learned from them
 But we did learn something
 At least we acted like we were learning something
 We watch movies non-stop
 Read stories and immerse yourself in the fictional world
 This is a work of art for many people
 The art world is a living world
 If you are a creative person
 Then this point is particularly correct
 It is the creative artists
 Is promoting the development of human knowledge
 First they will do this with their artwork
 They are testing on the edge
 Dancer, Poet, Visual Artist
 And the musicians are doing this
 But we are not sure what they are doing
 We are not sure what the musicians are doing
 What are they doing
 Why do you like music
 It will give you a deep hint of the meaning of things
 no doubt
 When you go to the concert, you feel an upsurge
 This is a kind of religious experience
 Especially when people really cheer up
 And push the whole group forward
 There is something very strong in this
 But I don’t understand
 This is not easy to understand
 Music is very regular
 And is regular on many levels
 I don't think this is irrelevant
 Because reality is also regular on many levels
 I think music expresses reality in a basic way
 We will be controlled by it and participate in it
 This is part of what makes this experience so exciting
 But we don’t really realize what we do
 We did it without thinking and this is also nourishing people
 Especially young people, many young people enjoy music very much
 Where they get their own meaning
 And the source of cultural identity
 Everything that can nourish people
 Are inseparable from the connection with music
 Because it is part of their cultural identity
 This is really a strange thing
 But the question is still not answered
 Where did the information in the dream come from
 I think it passed
 We observe everyone’s behavior patterns
 We have been observing
 We also observed
 Part of our cultural history
 This is what is deeply embedded in fictional works
 Such as about good and evil
 The story of the bad and the good and love
 These are the typical modes of existence of people
 And affect us deeply
 Because they represent
 What we do in this world
 What we learned about
 Individual information about yourself and others to visualize it
 In the long river of time
 There will be waves of behavior patterns of some people
 Great dramas are also staged in the crowd over time
 The artists observed and realized the meaning
 They will record it and tell us
 Then we have a clearer understanding of our behavior
 A great playwright like Shakespeare
 We all know that his works are all fiction
 Then we will say that the fictional works are not real
 But think about it
 It may be as real as a number
 Numbers are abstracted from potential reality
 But there is no sane person
 Would say that the numbers are not real
 You can even think like this
 Numbers are more real than things show
 Because this abstraction is too powerful
 When you master mathematics you have a killer
 You can use math to move the whole world
 Abstract is not more real than concrete reality
 This is not obvious
 When you watch a movie like "Hamlet"
 When such fictional works
 You will think it's not true
 Because this is a fictional work
 But you feel like wait a minute
 What is the explanation
 Maybe it's more real than non-fiction works
 You need a story to tell yourself
 This story to be told also needs
 About you and each of you
 This story will abstract it and show it
 This is the key part of human experience
 This is what is abstracted from the noisy matrix
 People get infected because they can recognize
 It shows part of their mode of existence
 This is the correct way to understand it
 Accompanying these ancient stories
 It seems to me that this process has been carried out for thousands of years
 It's like we observe ourselves first
 Then extract some stories like
 We imitate each other and show it in the drama
 Then we extract some essence from these dramas
 Repeat and complete the process
 God knows how long we spent
 I think part of these stories
 Someone has traced some fairy tales back to ten thousand years ago
 It exists in a relatively unchanging form
 In my opinion, the archaeological evidence must
 Shows those very old stories
 Like the stories in the beginning of the Bible
 At least a story as old as them
 It may be deeply rooted in prehistoric history long before them
 You may ask how can you be so sure
 I can answer at least part of it
 That is, the ancient civilization will not change quickly
 They stay the same, this is the answer
 Their information is passed on from generation to generation
 They stay the same
 We know that there are archaeological discoveries and some rituals are almost complete
 Lasted for nearly 20,000 years
 Someone found in a cave in Japan
 Which has a certain kind of
 The bear worship ceremony also has the characteristics of Western Europe
 So these things can last for a very long time
 We are observing each other in this world
 Then the problem is coming
 How long ago did we observe each other
 In a sense the answer to this question is
 Since the existence of a creature with a nervous system
 And this is a long time ago
 Hundreds of millions of years have passed
 May be longer
 We have been observing each other throughout this time course
 Trying to figure out what each other is doing
 Some of this knowledge is already built into your body
 Like this is why we can dance with other people
 Understanding is not an abstract concept that you understand
 It’s what you show in your behavior
 This is what children are doing when they learn to chase and fight
 They are learning how to in a harmonious way
 Integrate yourself with the bodies of others
 So as to learn to work together and achieve goals
 And these are manifested through their bodies
 This is not abstract knowledge
 They don't know what they are doing
 They did that anyway
 We can even move our body
 Used as a display platform
 We have been studying each other for a long time
 Analyze what we are doing and what we should do
 Here is a more basic question
 If you want to survive in this world
 You have to behave appropriately
 What does it mean to be so decent
 What can you do about this
 This question is right
 This is what we all want to know
 How do you survive in the world
 This is not how the world is made up
 We one yard into one yard
 How do you survive in the world
 This is an eternal problem for humans
 I guess we are the only one
 The species that really asked this question
 All other animals just do anything without thinking
 And we’re not like this. It’s our own problem. We have to be aware of this.
 We have to say it, God knows why, but this seems to be the case.
 Our behavior is shaped by the world and society
 Shaped into something we don’t understand but we can use it as a model to emulate
 We imitate it in the story and imitate it with our body
 This is the source of dream information
 Dream is involved in this process
 Observe everything and try to express it systematically
 It tries to get the signal from the noise
 And depicted in a dramatic form
 Because a dream is a little drama
 Then you have a chance to talk about what dreams are
 Then you will get systematic knowledge
 I think the existence of the Bible is
 It's like this between dreams and systematic knowledge
 Explore in the story of the Bible
 The meaning helps us understand
 Also suppose Nietzsche is right
 Jung and Dostoyevsky are right
 Then there is no cornerstone provided by this self-understanding
 We are lost
 This is very bad
 Because in this way we will be vulnerable to mental illness
 Those who firmly oppose religious ideas
 Seems to think so
 If we give up immersing in the potential dream
 We can immediately become like
 Rationalists like Descartes and Bacon
 Become a very clever, clear, rational and scientific person
 I don't think so
 I don't think there is any evidence to support this
 I think we will lose our minds sharply
 So that the most bizarre mystery in Catholicism
 Seem to become relatively positive and rational
 And I think this is already happening
 This is the general concept
 For you there is an unknown world
 You don't know anything about it
 It's like an ocean
 Surround the island where you are
 Something like this
 It is chaos itself
 You are acting in that world
 But your behavior is not known to you
 There is much more in your behavior
 What you can understand
 Jung made a point
 I liked it when I first understood it
 He said that everyone is acting out a myth
 But few people know what their myth is
 You should understand your myth
 Because it might be a tragedy
 Maybe you don't want it to be like this
 This is indeed something worth thinking about
 Because your behavior pattern shapes your character
 God knows where you got it from
 Part of the reason is biologically inherited from your parents
 This is burdened by you unintentionally
 This is how the philosophy of your society makes you
 And it's aiming you somewhere
 Is the place you are being targeted for suits your wishes?
 This is a good question
 This is part of self-actualization
 We know we don't understand our behavior
 Almost all your arguments with others are related to this
 Such as why did you do that
 You will come up with some
 Ambiguous reasons to explain your behavior
 You are like wandering in the dark
 You want to give yourself a reason
 But can't do it completely
 It's very very difficult
 Because you are a complicated animal
 It’s just that I have a clear mind
 Your existence is far beyond your control
 You can put something into action
 This can be regarded as an ability
 Then you will imagine what you put into action
 I also think about what other people are doing
 There is a lot of information in your actions
 Then this information is transformed into dreams
 Then presented in the form of art mythology and literature
 This contains a lot of information
 And part of it is translated into clear thoughts
 Let me give a simple example
 I think part of it is reflected in "Exodus"
 When Moses wrote the law
 He was wandering in the desert with the Israelis
 They sway and worship idols
 Began to become rebellious during this difficult time course
 Moses climbed up the mountain
 And get great revelation from God
 He was inspired by the enlightenment and finally went down the mountain holding the law
 Moses acted as an arbiter in the desert
 I know this is a fairy tale
 He keeps on
 Mediation between people who have problems
 Keep working hard to maintain peace
 What are you doing when you try to keep the peace
 You will try to understand what peace is
 You have to apply some principles
 What are these principles
 Ok you don't know
 These principles are to make people satisfied
 So as to make peace by shaking hands
 Maybe you need to try 10,000 times
 In order to slowly understand which principles can bring peace
 One day it will flash in your mind like a revelation
 So these are the rules we have been following
 This is the Ten Commandments
 This is the place to start
 Moses stepped forward and said
 This is basically what we have been doing
 It’s just that it’s now compiled into a law
 This is the entire historical process condensed into a single story
 But obviously this is how it happened
 Because we already have a written law
 Under a good legal system
 The law germinates from the bottom up
 This is how the common law system works
 A single judgment is based on existing principles
 Then clarify it and include it in the legal system
 The legal system is what you put into practice
 This is why it became a legal system
 This is why if you are a good citizen
 You will act in accordance with the legal system
 The legal system contains principles
 So the problem is coming
 What are the principles that guide our behavior
 I think when you initialize
 The deep meaning of God in the eyes of ancient Israel
 That’s what they meant to point out
 This is not a good enough explanation
 But imagine when you are a chimpanzee
 At the top of your society
 Have a strong ruler
 It represents power even more than this
 Because keeping a chimpanzee at the top of the hierarchy
 It takes more than physical strength
 It's far more complicated
 You can say that this ruler revealed a certain principle
 Then you will say if you know ten authority figures
 This principle can be more brilliant
 Then you can extract an authority concept from it
 You can extract a concept of power
 Then you can separate the concept from the crowd
 We have to do this sooner or later
 Because we can say that power in a human context
 We can also imagine what this means
 But it is separated from any concrete representation of power
 Why on earth are we doing this is too complicated
 If you are an orangutan and the powerful one is another orangutan
 This is not an abstract concept
 The problem is to imagine
 We all live under various hierarchies
 Some of them lasted for hundreds of years
 We are trying to figure out what the guiding principles are
 Try to extract the core of the guiding principles
 And express it in a mode of existence
 Something like this this is god
 This is an abstract ideal model
 It manifests as a form of personification
 It’s okay because in a way
 We are all trying to figure out what is
 Means to be functional and socially decent
 And the essence of the capable individual
 We are trying to figure out what it means
 You need a concrete avatar
 You need to abstract an ideal model
 So you can put it into practice
 Then it can make you understand
 What does this substance mean
 This is our intention
 This is the first hypothesis to some extent
 I am going to talk about some characteristics of this abstract ideal model
 This ideal model has been shaped by us as God
 But this is the first assumption
 The ideal model of philosophy or morality first presents itself as
 A real behavioral pattern
 This is a typical characteristic of an individual
 Then it became some individuals
 And then abstract from these individuals
 Finally you have this abstract concept
 And this is very important
 Here is an example of its political significance
 We can say that
 There was a debate between the early Christian church and the late Roman Empire
 That is whether an emperor can become a god
 Truly deify it and enshrine it in the temple
 You can now realize why this happened
 This is something proud of
 A man at the pinnacle of an extremely concentrated hierarchy
 He has power in the world
 Christian answer is
 Never assign a specific ruler
 Confuse with the principles of rule itself
 This is simply wonderful
 You can understand
 How difficult is this?
 Even if it’s a powerful person
 Have to submit to a certain divine principle
 Can't think of a better word
 Even the king himself must obey this principle
 We still think so because we firmly believe
 Our President and Prime Minister cannot be above the law
 No matter what the legal system is
 There must be one
 Principles that even leaders must obey
 If even this is missing, you can think
 You haven't even lived in a civilized society
 Because your leader will suddenly
 Transcendence and omnipotence
 This is clearly in the Soviet Union and
 What happened in Nazi Germany and other places
 Those in power can be said to be lawless
 You should succumb to god
 What does it mean
 We need to split it up and analyze it
 But part of the meaning is
 Even if you are a ruler you have to obey
 Principle of domination itself
 Then the problem comes again
 What is the principle of governance?
 I want to say on this issue
 We have been searching for a long time
 This is what we are going to talk about next
 Ancient Mesopotamians and Ancient Egyptians
 There are some very interesting things on this issue
 Dramatic view
 Let me give you a simple example
 Once upon a time there was a deity called Marduk
 Marduk was once a deity in Mesopotamia
 Imagine this is what happened
 An empire was established in the post-Ice Age
 That's 1-15,000 years ago
 All the tribes have gathered
 These tribes have their own deities
 Have their own ideal image
 But they started to occupy the same territory
 One tribe has deity A and the other has deity B
 And one of them can destroy the other
 Let’s suppose that God A wins
 This is not so good
 Because you might want to trade with these people
 Or maybe you don’t want to be in war
 Reasons like losing half of the population
 Then you are in an argument
 Whose god is
 Which ideal model will take the first place
 This seems to be in myth
 Portrayed as the battle of the heavenly gods
 From a practical point of view
 This is more like a continuous conversation
 You believe this i believe this
 You believe that i believe this
 How can we merge
 You will take away deity A you will take away deity B
 Then you might get from both
 Extract a deity C and then you say
 Deity C has the characteristics of both deity A and deity B
 Then other tribes started to join
 Deity C also took over these deities
 Marduk is an example. He has many names
 He has 50 names and some of them
 At least part of it belongs to its subordinate god
 These names symbolize
 The various tribes gathered to create the entire civilization
 This is a model of abstract ideals
 Part of the process
 You will think this is important
 This works because your tribe is still alive
 Then we draw on the strengths of both
 If we can do it
 Then extract a
 Can include more abstract concepts of both parties if we can do it
 There is something interesting about Marduk
 I will introduce you some of his characteristics
 He has eyes all around his head
 He is the king of the gods recommended by the gods
 This is the first feature
 Pretty awesome
 Marduk
 Because they face a terrible threat
 Something like a combination of a beast and a flood
 Marduk probably said
 If they choose him as the head of the gods
 He will stop the scourge
 Save them from extinction
 This is a serious threat
 It's the chaos itself that makes it comeback
 The gods agreed
 Thus Marduk became the new main god
 He has eyes all around his head
 Spit out the spell
 He will also take the initiative when he fights
 The god against him is called Diamat
 We need to know this
 Because of the word "diamat"
 Related to the word "Abyss" in English
 The abyss is the beginning of "Genesis"
 God created the chaos of order
 So it is closely related to this story
 Marduk took his all-seeing eye
 And the ability to vomit spells strikes
 And Diamatt went hand in hand
 Diamat seems to be some kind of ocean dragon
 This is a classic St. George story
 Punish the dragon
 Marduk chopped it into pieces
 And created the world with her corpse
 This is the world that humans inhabit
 The emperor of Mesopotamia is Marduk descended to earth
 As long as he is a good Marduk, he can sit on the throne
 This means that around his head
 Have eyes and vomit curses
 He must talk appropriately
 At this time we began to understand the essence of leadership
 Because what is leadership
 This is the ability to recognize the situation at hand
 I might even have to watch six ways and listen to all directions
 Maybe you need to use words decently
 The ability to turn chaos into order
 Only God knows Mesopotamians
 How long did it take to understand this
 All they can do is to dramatize it
 It's really wonderful
 And it's not obvious
 Chaos is really a strange thing
 This is the chaos that God wants to solve at the beginning of time
 Chaos is both psychological and de facto existence
 It cannot be accurately described in other ways
 The moment you face chaos
 When you are hit hard and lost
 When your world falls apart
 When you encounter something that pierces your heart
 When your dreams are shattered and betrayed
 Chaos emerged from it trying to swallow everything
 No doubt this is too heavy for you
 It drags you into the habitat of evil dragons in the underworld
 In that situation
 What you have is the ability to look around with round eyes
 And you need to do your best to speak carefully and speak clearly
 And if you are lucky enough
 You can survive the storm
 It took a long time for people to figure this out
 In my opinion this view is from
 Established in the survival criteria of our ancient ancestors
 Maybe this happened tens of millions of years ago
 Because when we are still using the same cognitive system
 This reflects the deep anxiety in our hearts
 At that time this system was used
 Representing snakes and other predators
 We are all flesh and blood
 We develop the ability to abstract things
 Abstract language
 Singular abilities
 But we still retain the deep cognitive system
 That existed when we were animals
 We have to use these existing systems
 Emotional and
 Part of the reason for the formation of the incentive structure
 We can demonize
 Part of the reason for the enemies who disrupt our code of conduct
 Because we recognize them as predators
 We follow the same cognitive system
 This is the chaos itself threatening us all the time
 This is 60 million years ago
 Those snakes climbing on the tree where we live
 This is basically the same system
 Part of Marduk's story
 Is about using insight and words
 The story of dealing with the most imminent threat
 Some of them are real world threats
 And some are psychological threats
 The threat levels of the two are comparable
 But the psychological threat is far from abstract
 But we are still using the same system to represent them
 This is why you freeze when you are frightened
 You are a prey
 You are like a rabbit
 I saw something coming to eat you
 You are frightened and paralyzed
 You become a stone statue
 This is what happens when you see a snakehead
 What happens when Medusa
 You will become a stone statue
 The reason you are paralyzed is
 You are still using the predator detection system to protect yourself
 Your heart rate rises and ready to move
 We are all upset by this system
 Take the story of Marduk as an example
 Its purpose is if something upsets you
 Like the horror of the chaos that threatens you
 Serpentine beast of the underworld
 Your best strategy is
 Organize language with eyes wide open
 Then go out and face the strange shape to create a new world
 This is really shocking
 When I read this story and started to understand it
 Really initiating
 This is really a profound insight
 And we also know that
 Because in psychotherapy we know
 It's better to face fear bravely than
 Let fear come to your door to improve your body and mind
 If you are a psychologist, part of your work
 Is to smash those fears into small pieces
 The things that upset them
 Then face them one by one to conquer them
 You are conquering in your heart
 This process in the strange and chaotic world
 The above are all building background
 We haven’t even started talking about the first sentence in the Bible
 But the above are all building background
 We extract from the entire historical process
 This series is full of false repetitions and weird stories
 And we have accumulated ideas from history
 This is the best thing we can do
 I know there are other religious traditions
 But at the moment i don't care about this
 Because we can use it as an example
 This is the best result we can achieve
 I hope everyone can
 Review these stories with an open mind
 Then observe if there is something we really need
 I hope to be able to do this
 Like I said before
 I will deal with it as rationally as possible
 Let’s start with the following point of view
 We know that there is something similar to the unknown
 We act in it like animals
 They just act without thinking
 They don’t imagine that we start here just by acting
 We start with action
 And then began to be able to express our behavior
 Then tell in words how we behave
 This gives us the ability to tell stories
 Because this is the meaning of the story
 Tell how we behave
 You know this because what happens when you read
 The image will come to mind when you read
 The characters in the book are moving in the form of images
 This is one step away from putting it into practice
 You don’t do it because you can abstract it
 You can behave without taking action
 This is amazing
 Partly due to the development of the prefrontal cortex
 This is the part of human abstract thinking ability
 You can extract the performance of the behavior from the behavior
 And control it before putting it into practice
 That's why you can think
 Then can summarize the behavior pattern
 You can experiment in a fictional world before you practice
 Not to die out of stupidity
 You can let this abstraction express death instead of yourself
 This is why you think
 It is also part of the purpose we want to achieve through the story
 What do i want to achieve
 I want to end this 12-session lecture series
 I know more than when I started
 This is my goal because I have already said
 I'm not instilling you what I know
 I just want to try to figure out some things
 What I am doing is completing part of the process
 So I started from my perspective
 Do my best to do this
 I came prepared but I want to work hard to stay in
 The edge of my ability is here I just can sum up knowledge
 Keep making it clear and investigating
 I hope this is what I am
 This is what I want to achieve
 It seems that there are still people interested in it
 Let's achieve this goal together
 I planned so
 The intention is
 Discover something in the foundation of this strange civilization
 This civilization was successfully built by our efforts
 But in my opinion it’s already at stake for more than one reason
 Maybe we don’t know it so easily
 Throw it all away, I think this is a huge mistake
 And it was abandoned because of resentment, hatred, resentment
 Ignorance of history and jealousy of others
 The desire for destruction and so on
 I don't want to fall into that situation
 That's really not a good idea
 We need to be more down to earth
 I wish, let's take one step at a time
 Ok so how do i proceed to do this
 First I will look at this issue from the perspective of evolution
 As far as I know, the universe has been 15 billion years since its birth
 The earth is 4.5 billion years old
 Life was born 3.5 billion years ago
 A creature with a well-developed nervous system
 Have existed for 300 to 600 million years
 60 million years ago
 We are still small mammals living in trees
 60 million to 7 million years ago
 We came up and down the tree to live on the ground
 At this moment we separated from the chimps
 The emergence of modern humans was about 150,000 years ago
 Civilization was also born after the last ice age
 It was about 15,000 years ago
 Not particularly long
 This time period is the part I want to study
 I want to know why we are what we are now
 Need from the origin of life itself
 Start to observe the continuing complexity of life
 Which must have real utility
 Because we share some characteristics with other animals
 Even simple animals like crustaceans
 Crustacean nervous system and
 Our nervous system has many similarities
 This is worth understanding
 I think from the perspective of evolution
 I think this is a matter of thinking about it
 Very grand and extraordinary angle
 Because the time span is incredible
 This is really amazing
 Think about living at the end of the 19th century
 And the people in the mid-19th century
 I really think this world is only about 6,000 years old
 15 billion years of history is much longer than this
 This is more magnificent
 But in a way it’s more terrifying and alienated
 Because the universe has become so vast
 It’s easy for humans to see themselves as trivial beings
 Sojourn in a dark corner of the Milky Way
 Among hundreds of millions of galaxies
 In this time span
 You can easily think of yourself as trivial
 This is a real challenge for people
 I don't think it's a good idea
 Because I feel conscious
 Far more limited than what we thought
 This is still something we have to solve
 My way of thinking is psychoanalytic
 It means i believe
 People are a collection of sub-personality
 And these sub-personality are alive and not a machine
 They have their own opinions, desires and perceptions
 They also have their own arguments and emotions
 They are like your low-resolution representations
 When you are angry
 It will look a lot like your very low resolution form of expression
 It just wants to eat angry
 Drinking or having sex
 It's yourself
 But it was reduced and concentrated in a specific direction
 All these incentive systems
 Are very old and powerful
 They play a decisive role when we express ourselves
 As Freud pointed out with the concept of "self"
 We must figure out
 How do we get these potential
 Animalistic motives and emotions
 And how to civilize it
 In order to coexist on the same territory
 Instead of tearing each other to pieces
 And the latter is probably
 Default settings for chimpanzees and humans
 So I really value this point of view
 That is the loose collection of we are all spirits
 There is a place in the Old Testament that says
 The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom
 I think the meaning of this sentence is similar to the above point of view
 That is do you know
 You can't completely control yourself
 There are other factors behind the scenes
 As the ancient Greeks thought
 They think humans are the playthings of the gods
 This is how they conceive the world
 What they say is almost the same
 They think that existence is not endogenous to us
 Power is driving us
 In a way this is the force we are obeying
 But not completely obey
 But you can obey them
 And they are controlling our destiny
 This is the view of the ancient Greeks
 It will make you humble so that you can understand it
 Because so much is happening behind the scenes
 You are driving a very complicated car
 But you don’t know much about this car
 It has its own motivation and methodology
 Sometimes you think it’s something
 But in fact it is quite different
 This phenomenon is very common in psychotherapy
 Because the psychiatrist is helping others to solve
 Of the behavior pattern it has always shown
 First they will describe the symptoms and realize the symptoms
 Then they may start to explore the cause
 They don’t know why they did that
 At first they must have
 Memory that leads to this behavior pattern
 This pattern must be recalled
 Perform analysis and evaluation
 Then patients must consider another way of behavior
 It's really complicated
 Let's talk about the literary perspective after the psychoanalytic perspective
 There is still a postmodernist concept of literature today
 Of course there is this view of the world
 If you interpret a complex literary work
 Such as the works of Shakespeare
 You can interpret it in countless ways
 You can read it word by word and sentence by paragraph
 You can also interpret the whole work
 The way you interpret it depends on how many books you have read before
 Also depends on your worldview
 It depends on many many things
 How educated you are or how uneducated you are
 Countless things like that
 This creates infinite possibilities for potential interpretation
 The postmodernists are a little bit arrogant here
 If there are countless ways to interpret a literary work
 How can you be sure of any of these interpretations
 Would be more reasonable than other interpretations
 If you are not sure about this
 How can you know which works are great
 How would you know that these works are not in power
 Tools to sustain its rule
 This is a very typical postmodernist view and very cynical
 It has its truth
 But the point is to be based on some real things
 Yes you can read things endlessly
 I want to show you something briefly
 We will talk back later
 have a look
 This is the best thing I have ever seen
 Each line at the bottom represents a verse
 The length of the line and this verse
 The number of times it is quoted in other scriptures is proportional
 So this is the first hyperlinked book
 I'm really serious about this
 Obviously you cannot activate the hyperlink with a mouse click
 But this is a book of hyperlinks through and through
 This is because the people who created these stories
 Assuming these stories are the end
 In fact, it means the end cannot affect the beginning
 This is the rule of time
 What happens now will not affect what happened ten years ago
 Although it is actually possible, no matter what
 You can reinterpret the past and they will change
 Anyway, let's not talk about this
 Technically speaking, the present cannot affect the past
 But this is not the case for a literary work
 Because when you write to the end, you know what the beginning is like
 When you write the beginning or modify the beginning
 You also know what the ending is like
 Then you can weave the whole story
 It can be seen from this picture
 A total of 65,000 cross references
 For this book, this is a really amazing visual presentation
 Why it is so profound
 Why is this book so profound
 Let's imagine
 How many ways can you take in these hyperlinks
 This can be said to be a journey that never ends
 You will never reach the end
 Among them are permutation and combination
 Every word depends on other words
 Every sentence depends on other sentences
 Of course not exactly
 But 65,000 is not a small number anymore
 This seems to make
 Postmodernist comments are more correct
 What do you know from such works
 How can we sum up an authoritative explanation?
 Seems impossible
 But there is a problem in my opinion
 That is what postmodernists have
 Apply this view to the whole world
 They will say look at this text is too complicated
 You can't come up with an authoritative explanation
 What about the world
 The world is much more complicated than a text
 You can infinite ways
 Observe the world
 Then how do we know a way
 Would be better than the other
 This is a good question
 The postmodernist answer is that we have no way of knowing
 This answer is not very good
 Because you will fall into chaos in this situation
 You can't know anything
 This is not a good thing
 Because knowing nothing about things is not a neutral and harmless event
 It can cause anxiety and depression
 If things are so chaotic that you can't start
 Your body will return to the default critical alert mode
 Increased heart rate and immune system stops functioning
 You will run out of oil
 You will age very fast
 Because everything around is beyond your control
 This is the existential crisis
 It makes people feel anxious and depressed
 Not only that we found
 Our nerve structure is like this
 If we don’t set a goal and move towards it
 We will not experience any positive emotions
 It’s not that reaching the goal makes us happy
 If you have achieved something, you will know
 When you reach your goal
 This little game is over
 You need to invest in another game
 So this is what Sisyphus’s god punished
 But it does show
 Reaching the goal does not become the motivation to drive you
 Because it will crash the whole game
 That's it when you graduated from university
 It's like you were the king of the mountain the first day
 Then you will be working at Starbucks for five years
 Humans are really strange creatures
 We have goals
 And will be more energetic when advancing towards it than when reaching the goal
 The meaning is that you must have a goal
 Is that you must have an explanation
 It also means that the more lofty your goal
 This is a way to think about it, the better your life will be
 The funny thing is that you've heard this
 Even when you were very young
 Others tell you to be a good person
 For example, don't lie and then you will think
 Why should i be a good person why not lie
 Even a three-year-old will ask that
 By the way, smart kids will learn to lie earlier
 They wonder why they don’t distort the structure of the facts
 In order to meet my specific short-term needs
 This is a great question why not
 Since you can escape punishment
 Why do you have to follow ethics?
 Besides, this can be one step closer to what you want
 Why not do this
 Really a good question
 But it is not obvious
 This seems to be closely related to what I said before
 If you make yourself unstable
 Things will become messy, which is very problematic
 If you don't have a lofty goal
 What you have is just a trivial pleasure
 And these pleasures can’t keep you
 This is not good because life is really hard
 Filled with too much suffering and complexity
 When it's over, everyone dies. It's painful
 Without a lofty goal
 What do you use to resist these
 You can't help you despair
 When you despair
 Things will deteriorate quite quickly
 So there is the concept of lofty goals
 It is necessary
 This is the food necessary for people to survive
 This is not some mysterious food
 It is the lofty goal
 And what is the lofty goal?
 Part of it has been concentrated in
 Marduk's story is in
 That is to always focus on speaking appropriately and face the chaos
 Build a better world
 It's something like this
 This is the lofty goal
 It will make you stand upright
 Instead of shrinking into a ball and thinking about your own existence
 So you can do something worth the time
 Just to give you on this planet
 A miserable situation
 From the perspective of literature
 You can explain a text from many angles
 But this is not right
 This is where the postmodernists go wrong
 What you are looking for in a text
 The same principle is to be pursued in the world
 Is enough order and direction
 We have to consider
 What does adequate order and direction mean
 You don't want to suffer too much
 So that your life becomes unbearable
 This seems pretty self-explanatory
 Pain is to justify yourself
 I think pain is the fundamental reality
 Because no one will argue about it
 Even if you say you don’t believe in pain
 Won't make you feel better when you suffer
 You still believe
 You cannot eradicate it with logic and reason
 It exists fundamentally
 And it’s actually very useful to recognize this
 That is you don’t want to suffer more
 Unless it is absolutely necessary
 I think it goes without saying
 But you might say wait a minute
 The problem is not so simple
 Not only do you not want to suffer more than necessary today
 And tomorrow next week
 Next month and next year
 So no matter what you do now
 It's best not to endanger yourself in a year
 Because it will backfire
 This is the problem of short-term pleasure
 I regret a lot of hastily
 Everyone understands this truth
 What you do will work right now
 To be sustainable tomorrow, next week, next month and beyond
 So you have to think about the future
 Humans can do this
 Consider your future
 This is not much different from taking care of others
 I remember there was an episode in The Simpsons
 Homer drank a quart of mayonnaise and vodka
 Marge said that you shouldn't do this
 Then Homer answered that it was the future Homer’s question.
 Fortunately I am not that person
 It's so funny
 But we need to work hard to overcome this
 Future you
 Is a bit like another person
 And handle you properly
 Relationship with the future self
 And figure out how
 No different from other people
 So we can relieve the constraints
 The explanation you extracted
 Not only protect you
 Free from pain and give you a goal
 And it must be done in an iterable way
 So it can continue over time
 And this process also requires the participation of others
 So you can work with them
 In a way that reduces your own pain
 Do something with them
 People are not so forgiving
 They have a choice
 They don’t have to deal with you
 They can also deal with other primates
 If you behave inappropriately
 At least if you cross certain boundaries then you will be left out
 People are spreading information to you all the time
 About how you need to interpret the world
 So they can tolerate you when they are by your side
 And you also need this because if you are isolated from the world
 You will be insane until death
 No one can stand long loneliness
 Without constant feedback from others
 We can't stay sane
 This is simply too complicated
 You are bound by your existence
 You will also be bound by the existence of others
 At the same time the world is restricting you
 I read this point from "Hamlet"
 That's i should jump off the bridge
 So that my explanation can end soon
 This doesn't seem to work very well
 An explanation is constrained by the reality of the world
 It is also bound by the reality of others
 Your reality restricts it over time
 In a tightly defined space
 Only a few explanations make sense
 This is part of the reason why postmodernists went wrong
 This is also how people work hard to create artificial intelligence
 When making smart machines
 Part of the reason why it must be limited to one entity
 From this we can see that if we don’t materialize it
 You can't make any smart machines
 This is part of the reason I just described
 You need to constrain the system
 Otherwise the entire system will be submerged
 In the ocean of infinite interpretation
 Almost like this
 This is its literary aspect
 Moral aspect
 Ethics is only related to behavior to me
 To some extent I am an existentialist
 That means I firmly believe
 What people believe in truth
 It's the behavior, not the words
 There are many definitions of truth
 Truth is a very broad word
 You can think of objective truth
 But behavioral truth and objective truth are consistent
 As far as I know, what you should do is not the same as the facts
 People are divided on this
 But I think the reason should be the same
 Think of it this way, you stand in front of a wilderness
 You can see the wilderness
 But the wilderness won’t tell you how to pass it
 You can walk through it in countless ways
 So you can't extract
 An inviolable guide to guide you
 How to act in front of all kinds of facts
 There are so many facts that you will lose direction
 But you need to know how to avoid pain
 Need to know what your goal is
 So you need to use some explanatory structure
 To superimpose on objective reality
 This is what we want to focus on
 The essence of explanatory structure
 I have given a hint before
 We have taken it from the observation of our own behavior
 Extracted from observations of others
 The part we extract is
 With our concretized nature
 This is formed in the past billions of years
 We see the infinite plane of fact
 Then we imposed a moral explanation on it
 Moral explanation is how to act on objective existence
 This is related to the sense of security
 Because you just don't want to make things too complicated
 And this is also related to the goal
 We are moving creatures
 We need to know where to go
 In general everything we care about
 Where is the future
 This is what we need to know
 Where are we going and what are we doing and why
 This is the same as "Objectively what makes the world?"
 Are two different things
 This is a completely different question
 It requires a completely different answer
 As far as I know this is the realm of morality
 That's what your goal is
 In a sense, this question is about the ultimate ideal paradigm
 Although you have some trivial ideals
 Something will emerge from it
 More coherent and integrated
 Applicable and practical things
 This brings up another point
 When you think of literature and art
 You will think they are not very grounded
 They are illusory and divine
 Seems impractical
 And i'm a real person
 I think from the perspective of literary aesthetics and evolution
 Part of the reason to review these books is
 I want to extract something of practical value from it
 Because I have a rule when I lecture
 That’s what I won’t tell others that is useless to them
 I think knowledge is a tool
 It is something to be implemented in this world
 We are creatures that use tools
 Our knowledge is the tool
 We need to use tools to work in this world
 We need tools to regulate our emotions
 To improve things
 To end the pain as much as possible
 Come calmly and stand on its own feet
 You need tools to do this
 So in this series of lectures
 I don't want to do anything unrealistic
 I want you to leave
 Can have some systemic things
 And it's something that can be used immediately
 I am not interested in abstracting for the sake of abstraction
 It needs to be reasonable it has to be meaningful
 Because the more restrictions on the theory, the better
 I want everything to have a context
 B followed by AA and B before C
 This way is understandable
 No unnecessary leap of faith
 Dealing with us and people like the Bible
 The relationship between a set of books
 Another problem is that you are being asked
 To believe in something other people can’t believe
 That's not good
 Because it seems to me it is a form of lies
 Then you have to void the whole thing
 Because in principle this whole thing is about truth
 If you want to swallow a lot of lies
 To start your pursuit of truth
 How can you achieve any achievement
 I don’t want to leave any uncertainty fundamentally
 Or I don’t want to leave any
 I don't need to be left uncertain
 Because then I can't go deeper
 It must have a reasonable meaning
 I also don't want it to work with
 Known scientific facts contradict
 Although science is constantly changing
 That is a dangerous parameter
 For example, if a solution doesn’t make sense in the theory of evolution,
 Then this is not a good solution
 Then there is the last point of phenomenological perspective
 Modern people think reality is objective
 We are very strong
 But we don’t experience reality like this
 We all have our experience field
 But this is a very difficult thing to understand
 Although it should be the most obvious
 For phenomenologists, everything you experience is true
 They are very interested in your subjective experience structure
 You have your subjective experience, you also have everyone
 But these experiences have something in common
 For example, you will all experience the same set of emotions
 We can recognize typical emotions
 We can’t even communicate without the typical motivation
 Because you don't know what the other person is like
 In this case you have to explain endlessly
 Nothing you can take for granted
 But you can do
 Phenomenology is
 In the center of my sight and hands
 Those are clear but to the edge of this range
 They disappear
 Phenomenology is about how things smell and taste
 And their importance
 Then in a sense you can also say the same
 Phenomenology studies
 The importance of matter rather than matter itself
 From a phenomenological perspective
 A basic fact is that everything has meaning
 Even if you are a rationalist, cynicist, nihilist
 Saying that everything is meaningless
 You still face the problem of "pain"
 Pain is meaningful, it weakens your argument
 Meaning cannot be escaped
 You can largely destroy the positive part of it
 But you try hard
 Can you figure it out from the negative side?
 Good luck because it doesn't work at all
 "Bible" story is about phenomenology
 I think all fictional works are like this
 It is dedicated to clarifying the nature of human experience
 This is different from the objective world
 It is also a form of truth
 Because your field of experience is real
 Also quality
 So the question is what is quality
 The representation of reality in ancient times is
 A strange mixture of observable phenomena
 This is what we call objective facts
 At that time, there was also a projection of subjective facts in the representation of reality
 I will show you
 How do Mesopotamians see the world
 Their world model is a disc
 If you walk into a clearing in the dark
 What can the world look like to you
 Isn't it just a disc?
 There is also a dome on this disc
 This is basically the worldview of the Mesopotamians
 The person who wrote the opening stories of the Bible
 View the world in this way
 The water on the dome is obvious
 Because it always rains, right
 Where does the water come from?
 There is also water around the dome
 The whole disc is made of land
 There is water flowing under the ground
 How do you know this
 You can drill down to get water
 This water comes down from the ground
 How else can you get water
 What's under this fresh water
 Further down
 If you go to the edge of the disc
 You will see the sea and that is salt water
 So this is a dome surrounded by water
 The dome covers a disc
 Fresh water flows under the disc
 There is salt water further down
 This is roughly the world in the eyes of the Mesopotamians
 It is a mixture of observation and imagination
 Because this is not the real world
 Just what the world shows
 This is a completely credible cosmology
 The sun rises and sets over the dome
 It doesn't look like something is going around
 How could anyone think of this
 Obviously the sun rises and sets
 Then it moves below the world and then rises again
 Nothing more obvious than this
 This is on the cognitive level
 The weird interweaving of subjective fantasy and visible phenomena
 All related to the story of the Bible
 The universe theory is exactly the same
 It is semi-psychological and semi-realistic
 And the psychological part is actually real
 I understand that in the Bible story
 Phenomenological truth is indeed worth it
 Poor fundamentalists
 Trying to stick to their moral structure
 I can understand why
 Because it really organized their society and soul
 So they have to rely on
 But for the complexity that constitutes truth
 They don’t have a very precise concept
 They tried to put the "Bible" story
 Fetched in the field of scientific theory
 For example, to promote creationism
 Treat it as another scientific theory
 Isn't this futile
 The person who wrote these stories
 Not a scientist at all
 There were no scientists at all
 Of course not much now
 It’s really hard for us to see things from a scientific perspective
 This requires a lot of training
 Outside the lab
 Scientists don’t use scientific thinking
 Of course they don’t use scientific thinking very much in the laboratory
 Because you have to be peer reviewed and criticized
 Scientific thinking is really hard
 No matter how the people who wrote these stories
 The way of thinking is very similar to that of playwrights
 It's like Shakespeare's way of thinking
 But this does not mean that there is no truth in it
 It just means that in the concept of truth
 You need to be more precise, this is okay
 There will always be some practical truths, right?
 We want to figure out what these truths are
 Because we need to live
 Maybe need not suffer too much
 So if you know the "Bible" story
 And what other stories try to show is
 Past experience of conscious individuals
 The structure that the conscious individual has experienced
 You may enter a completely different field of understanding
 It eliminates the gap between the objective world and the religious story
 Painful contradiction
 Let’s take a look at the structure of this book
 The first thing to mention about the Bible is
 It's a comedy
 Comedy has a happy ending
 This is weird
 Because Greek mythology is almost always tragedy
 And the Bible is a comedy
 Have a happy ending
 Everyone is alive and there is a heaven
 How do you think about it is another matter entirely
 I'm just telling you the structure of this story
 It can be said that there is a heaven at the beginning of time
 Then there were some disasters and people fell into history since then
 History is to limit death pain and self-awareness
 But there is a pattern
 Or imply a model of nation-building
 It can surpass those
 This is also what time points to
 This is the concept of the story
 What’s interesting is that the Bible also has a story
 Because it was not a book when it was written
 It's a combination of many different books
 These books can be combined to form a story
 This is really extraordinary
 The question is what this story tells
 How it became a story
 Is there any reason
 It constitutes a dramatic record of self-realization or abstraction
 I mentioned this before
 The idea of ​​formulating the image of God is an abstraction
 This is how we will proceed to interpret it later
 Because I said before
 I will not simplify unnecessary
 I want to say that I know the evidence of true religious experience
 Is beyond doubt
 But it is also unexplainable
 So i won't explain it
 I want to treat it as a fact
 Then I will pull out of it
 For example, we first treat it as a fact and a mystery
 Then we have to look at it from a rational perspective
 Another example is the initial formulation of the concept of God
 Is an attempt to abstract the ideal model
 Then we consider it as an abstract consideration outside of realisation
 That's good enough
 It would be amazing if this is true
 But I don’t want to kill a boat with a stick
 This is a set of books launched by many editors and editors
 What does this mean
 Means that many people are involved in writing
 Formed many different books
 All mixed together
 Especially the first five books were compiled by a specific group of people
 I suspect they are under a single political organization
 Integrate tribal traditions
 And try to connect what they describe
 They learn from each tribe’s traditions
 And don’t miss any case easily
 Because they seem to be precious
 Looking at the people who compiled these stories
 It must be precious
 Because they can't tolerate excessive deletions
 But they want to think it makes sense to some extent
 So that the book will not be completely illogical and absurd
 Many people participated in writing
 Many people also participated in the editing
 There are many people in a long time course
 Combine it
 Documents like this are very rare
 And just because we have a document like this
 There are enough reasons to regard it as
 An extraordinary phenomenon
 And there are enough reasons to work hard to understand
 The message it tries to convey
 I said this is the world’s first hyperlinked book
 This is indeed very intriguing for a long time
 The Old Testament
 Or the Hebrew Bible has four bases
 Four stories we know come together
 The first is the priest document
 The name of God in it is called "Ilohim" or "Ilshade"
 I think "Yil" is also the origin of the word "Allah"
 It is often translated as "God/God" or "Gods"
 Because the word "Elohim" is in the first few books of the Bible
 Is in the plural
 This background is newer than Jehovah’s documents
 The reason I say this is
 The first chapter of Genesis is the first story
 It was not created in the same period as the second chapter of Genesis
 Chapter 2 contains the content of Jehovah's version
 It contains the story of Adam and Eve
 It is older than the first book in the Bible
 But they decided to put the new version first
 I think this is because it deals with more fundamental abstractions
 Reasons like this
 It deals with the most basic abstract concepts
 About how the universe was formed
 Then it was connected to the appearance of the human environment
 It seems that the logic behind it is like this
 The four-character God’s name is used in the Jehovah literature
 Obviously people don’t think so
 But we know that its pronunciation is similar to "Jehovah"
 This version contains an extremely anthropomorphic God
 Have a human appearance
 This point starts in the fourth chapter of the second chapter of Genesis
 This is the description of heaven and earth
 It also contains the story of Adam and Eve
 The story of Cain and Abel The story of Noah's Ark
 And the story of the Tower of Babel "Exodus"
 And "Numbers" also contains priest documents
 It also contains the law
 To show in the form of the Ten Commandments is only in form
 Because the Ten Commandments are like an abridged form of the law
 Then there is the original copy of the Elohim literature
 It contains the story of Abraham and Isaac
 Which involves a heavenly hierarchy that includes angels
 It also talked about the journey of leaving Egypt and gave the covenant
 This is the concept of society
 This refers to Israeli society
 This idea is based on a contract with God
 A list of regulations
 Part of it is the ten commandments
 And there are more extensive regulations than this
 The last one is the original text of Deuteronomy
 It contains most of the law
 It also contains what is called the history of Deuteronomy
 It is related to "Genesis" and "Exodus"
 "Leviticus" and "Numbers" independent
 At least we understand this
 The controversy about these scripts is really all-encompassing
 I just touched on the knowledge of this academic field in general
 But usually people think
 The Bible has different authors in many different periods
 My conclusion is drawn through research text analysis
 I.e. try to find the same style
 A long story with the same citation
 People are arguing about it because
 It is obviously difficult to reproduce ancient things
 That's roughly it
 This is the collection of opinions about these initial questions
 It's important to know this
 It's like a collection of stories
 It’s strange to understand the first part of Genesis
 I want to turn to some content in the New Testament
 This is the central element of Christianity
 This is indeed a very strange idea
 And it will take a long time to analyze
 The following is what John the Baptist said about Christ
 He said "there was a way in the beginning" (about 1:1)
 This sentence is somewhat related to the first chapter of Genesis
 "In the beginning
 "The Tao is with God and the Tao is God" (John 1:1)
 These three sentences have a lot to analyze
 Because they all seem to have no meaning
 "In the beginning
 "The Tao is with God and the Tao is God" (John 1:1)
 So the first question is what does this mean
 "There was Tao in the Beginning" (about 1:1)
 This is actually "Logos"
 And the image of Jesus is the visualization of Logos
 The view in the Gospel of John is that Christ is the Son
 No matter what
 He is not in a certain time and space
 As a carpenter in a barren land
 But outside of time and space
 Still exists in an eternal form
 This is what existed in the beginning
 For me, logos represents
 What modern people mean when they talk about consciousness
 Similar to this but more than this
 It's like consciousness
 Its ability is to comprehend and communicate
 The implication lies in the existence of creatures
 Especially from a phenomenological point of view
 Life is experience
 The existence of creatures is inseparable from consciousness
 It's like saying that consciousness shoots a light on the dead object
 Transform it into a creature
 What else exists without consciousness
 No one can experience anything
 If no one can experience anything
 Is there anything else?
 This is a problem
 The answer given in this book is no
 You have to think of consciousness as
 An indivisible element of reality
 This is the necessary condition for reality to exist
 Of course this will raise questions about the definition of reality
 But the reality mentioned here refers to
 As i mentioned
 Refers to the weird mixture of subjective experience and the world
 But the depth of this question is more than that
 If no one has experienced it
 There can be no obvious way to determine what exists
 The whole concept of time will fall apart
 At least in terms of perceiving the flow of time
 The concept of size has essentially disappeared
 Because there is nothing to measure it
 Causality also seems to cease to exist
 We can't understand the consciousness is really ignorant
 We can't understand
 What gives us the light of life in our body
 What happened in the Old Testament
 At least in part
 Is to connect this consciousness with divinity
 Now think about it, is this a reasonable proposition?
 This question is complicated
 But at least we will find that this description is a bit problematic
 Because there is a miraculous experience
 And existence depends on consciousness
 People always prevaricate after just explaining it
 But there seems to be no good result
 And this is something to consider
 I think it is worth considering
 People don’t like to be seen as unconscious
 Their reaction will be intense
 If someone thinks you are unconscious
 You will be upset
 If someone thinks you have no free will
 You will be upset
 Because that means you are only fully confined to
 In your behavior
 There is no remedy
 At the same time you are not responsible for your actions
 Our culture the law of our culture
 Are built on
 People are consciously based
 People have experience
 Make decisions and be responsible
 This embodies the element of free will
 You can raise objections from a philosophical point of view, of course it’s fine
 But the point is that this is how we behave
 And this is the premise of our legal system
 There is something deeper in this
 Because you are restricted by law
 But the law is also restricted by you
 That is to say in a well working
 Under a reasonable democratic system
 You have intrinsic value
 This is the source of your rights
 Even if you are a murderer
 We must also say that the law cannot do whatever you want
 Because you have a divine side
 What does this mean
 Part of its meaning is
 Part of you is conscious
 Ability to communicate
 Like you are a self-contained world
 You can use it to contribute to others, which is valuable
 You can learn new knowledge to transform the structure of society
 And can invent new ways to deal with the world
 You can do it all
 This is part of you
 This involves this
 The concept of logos
 For the absolutely chaotic reality
 Logos are indispensable
 Beyond expressing its existence as reality through experience
 This is an amazing view
 Because it allows your consciousness to act in the universe
 An indispensable role
 You can refute it
 But you can’t simply erase it
 Because first
 We are the most complicated thing in existence
 At least in the known world is quite complicated
 We are incredibly complicated
 There are many universes outside
 But there are many universes within
 Which of the two is greater is hard to say
 Unless you use something irrelevant
 Such as relative size
 But this is really not a strict plan
 No matter what you have
 Experience reality and the ability to transform reality
 This is a very strange thing
 You can imagine the future in your imagination
 Then you can show it in practice
 Participate in the creation process
 This is an angle to think about this issue
 That's why
 I think the first chapter of Genesis is related to this point of view
 That is, human beings are all created in the image of divinity
 Whether it is a man or a woman
 But it’s interesting that feminists are always
 Criticize Christianity as an outright patriarchy
 Of course they will criticize everything as patriarchal
 So this is rarely a whimsical idea
 But I think this is definitely a miracle
 The beginning of a document is straightforward
 Without any hesitation
 Said that the brilliance of divinity is connected with Tao
 Tao gives birth to life again
 It is reflected equally in men and women
 This is really awesome
 Like I said before, you will definitely think
 Will you take this seriously
 What you want to ask is
 What will happen if you don't take it seriously, right
 Read "Crime and Punishment" by Dostoevsky
 This is among the existing works
 The best inquiry about this thinking strategy
 In Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment
 The hero's name is Raskolnikov
 He believes that other people have no intrinsic value
 Of course he can do whatever he wants
 Only cowardice will stop him
 If the value of others is just an arbitrary superstition
 What else is left
 Why can't I act recklessly every time
 This is the way mental patients think
 So this is what Raskolnikov did
 He killed a very disgusting person
 And he had a good reason to kill her
 He was half-starved and a little mentally disturbed
 And obsessed with an ideology
 This is depicted very well in the book
 And he discovered one thing after killing her
 That is Raskolnikov before and after the murder
 Pan Ruo two are completely different because he broke a commandment
 He has committed a serious violation
 "Crime and Punishment" is what I know
 The best inquiry into this situation
 This situation is if you firmly believe that there is no
 What will happen in any divinity
 Most people I know are staunch atheists
 I also understand why they become staunch atheists
 They will not be like Dostoyevsky
 Such people raise objections
 As far as I know, I didn’t find that in Crime and Punishment
 What logical loopholes exist
 I think he is very accurate in psychology
 At this point Dostoyevsky is really a strange man
 In his other book "The Demons"
 Depicts a political situation
 No different from where we are now
 Some of them firmly believe
 Rationalist utopia and atheistic views
 They have great energy
 Then they set off a revolution
 These are all powerful views
 Among them is a character named Stavrokin
 It also guides practice with such a premise
 That is that human beings have no inner essence
 No intrinsic value
 This is another wonderful inquiry
 Dostoevsky predicted the development trend of society
 If you really follow this road
 He became a true saying after ages
 After reading "The Demon", you will find it incredible
 Or "The Enchanter" depends on the difference in translation
 When you read Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s
 You will feel this way in "Gulag Islands"
 The first book is a fictional work and a prophecy
 And the second one is to take a look
 What happened here is exactly what Dostoyevsky predicted
 The reasons are the same
 This is really amazing
 So the problem is
 Do you really object to the following views
 A Consciousness is an indispensable part of the universe
 B Consciousness is likely to be considered divine
 C Does it manifest in everyone?
 And if you are not a criminal
 Ask yourself if you don't act accordingly
 Ask yourself what it means
 Does it reflect reality? Is it a metaphor?
 Maybe it's a complicated metaphor
 We use it to organize our society
 It's very possible
 But even a metaphor, it is true enough
 So that we play with it regardless of our own safety
 And it also takes a long time for people to figure out
 This is the first chapter of Genesis
 But I might end here
 Because it's half past nine
 But we didn’t even mention the first sentence
 I want to read something
 Make an introduction for the next lecture
 I will start from a set related to divinity
 Pick some reading
 Let’s go back to the first few words of the lecture
 By the way, I don’t know that in the end we can cover
 How many "Bible" stories
 Because I'm trying to figure out my clues while teaching
 There is a concept in Christianity
 Call the image of God the "Trinity"
 The element of the Father
 Element of the son
 There are also elements of the Holy Spirit
 It’s a bit like the traditional spirit
 Humans are the latest incarnation of this tradition
 This traditional living body and the spirit
 Makes the relationship between the individual and the spirit possible
 I want to quickly go over
 Some classic and metaphorical attributes of God
 So that we can have a rough idea later
 In order to understand that when we look back at the first chapter of Genesis and
 Discuss what God is talking about when he shapes creatures from chaos
 There is the Father's side here
 So God is like a father
 You can make a contract with
 You can also make an agreement
 But think about it now
 It's like money
 Because money is an agreement with the future
 The world we build
 Is to enable you to negotiate with the future
 I don't think when we are doing this
 Didn't realize it at all
 You can see the future as real when you act
 Because there is a traditional spirit that makes you
 Treat the future as an object of negotiation when acting
 This is why you will make sacrifices
 We have a long history of sacrificing
 But now it’s only done on a psychological level.
 We know you can sacrifice the valuable things in the moment
 I hope you are with some kind of
 Negotiating something that represents a transcendent future
 This is an amazing human discovery
 No other creature can do this
 Treat the future as real when you act
 Knowing that you can negotiate with reality
 And it really works
 This is incredible
 It will respond to sacrifice
 It also answers prayer
 By the way, I didn't say these are true
 I'm just talking about what this rough concept represents
 It will punish and reward
 It will judge and forgive
 It is not natural
 Judaism and Christianity
 A bit strange
 That is that God and nature are not the same thing at all
 No matter what god is
 He is partly represented in the logos
 And logos are separate from nature
 I think it's like consciousness
 It is abstracted from the natural world
 It created the Garden of Eden for mankind
 But drove us out for the sin of disobedience
 It can only be viewed from a distance and not playable
 It gives us free will
 Stay away from it is hell
 To stay away is death
 It is revealed in dogmatic and mysterious experience
 It is the law
 This is probably the Father’s side
 Look at the side of the son
 It creates order in chaos
 It kills the dragon and feeds the people with its flesh and blood
 It finds treasure to save chastity
 It is the blood of Christ
 It is a scapegoat for the tragic victim
 Is also the savior of eternal triumph
 It cares about the abandoned
 It died but reborn
 It is the king of kings
 It is not a country
 But at the same time fulfilling and criticizing the country
 It came to the perfect apartment
 It also pursues wonderland or heaven
 It can save lives from hell
 It also cares about the abandoned people
 It is the foundation and cornerstone of rejection
 It is the spirit of the law
 Finally, the side of the Holy Spirit
 It is similar to the human soul
 It is the voice of the prophet
 It's the murmur of consciousness
 The truth of its words
 It is inspired by music
 It is the enemy of arrogance and resentment
 It is the water of life
 It burns without embers
 It is a dazzling light
 This is a very complete set of poetic metaphors
 What do you say
 It's all a glimpse of a transcendent ideal model
 This is the right way to think about it
 They are all glimpses of transcendent ideals
 They also have clear meanings
 While we are conducting this series of lectures
 To a certain extent, it is also understanding the meaning
 What we are talking about now
 At least a brief description of these
 "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1:1)
 We know that in the next story
 It is closely related to logos
 We know it is connected with Tao
 Also connected with consciousness
 And we also know
 It is also connected to God no matter what he is
 Then I will unfold a metaphorical picture
 At least it portrays God in part
 Now we are right
 A little understanding of the existence of the creation world
 "Earth is emptiness and chaos" (Genesis 1:2)
 This is the prehistoric state of chaos and ambiguity
 "Darkness
 "God's Spirit is running on the water" (Genesis 1:2)
 "God said "Let there be light" and there will be light" (Genesis 1:3)
 We're going to end here
 Because we are ready
 To the beginning of this book
 Took a tentative step
 It’s important to organize your conceptual framework properly
 So you can experience
 The direction of travel and the possible meaning in it
 Then i have done my best today
 How to say it
 Explaining this word painstakingly makes me feel
 But this is not as simple as talking about it, so you know
 It took a long time to reach this point
 Not so unreasonable
 At this moment you can finally realize a bit
 About the meaning of this word
 It is far from reaching
 It is not
 I thought I could go a little deeper than I currently
 So be it, thank you very much
