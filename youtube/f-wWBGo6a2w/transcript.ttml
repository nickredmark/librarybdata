<p begin="00:00:18.200" end="00:00:22.450" style="s2"> The translations used in this subtitle when referring to the original text of the &quot;Bible&quot; are based on the &quot;Mandarin Chinese Union Version&quot; (&quot;God&quot; version)</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.925" end="00:00:27.575" style="s2"> The Psychological Significance of &quot;Bible&quot; Stories Dr. Jordan B. Peterson First Lecture May 16, 2017</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.133" end="00:00:32.141" style="s2"> Thank you all for coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.141" end="00:00:34.450" style="s2"> What surprised me was</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.450" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2"> Everyone really has nothing to do on Tuesday night</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.789" end="00:00:44.485" style="s2"> It&#39;s really weird in a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.485" end="00:00:47.300" style="s2"> So many people come to listen</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.300" end="00:00:52.475" style="s2"> A series of lectures on the psychological significance of &quot;Bible&quot; stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.516" end="00:00:54.125" style="s2"> I have wanted to do this for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.125" end="00:01:01.988" style="s2"> But what surprised me was that someone would be willing to listen</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.050" end="00:01:07.300" style="s2"> That’s great, let’s take one step at a time</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.900" end="00:01:11.076" style="s2"> I want to start with this because the question is very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:13.572" style="s2"> Why bother to do this</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.572" end="00:01:16.004" style="s2"> I don’t mean why you should take this effort</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.125" end="00:01:18.372" style="s2"> I have my own reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.794" end="00:01:19.818" style="s2"> But you might think</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.882" end="00:01:23.594" style="s2"> Why bother with this strange ancient book</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.225" end="00:01:30.186" style="s2"> This is a good question</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.775" end="00:01:39.466" style="s2"> This contradictory document has been pieced together into a book for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.466" end="00:01:42.538" style="s2"> It survives beyond countless kingdoms</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.538" end="00:01:48.106" style="s2"> This is really interesting. A book is tougher than a rock</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.106" end="00:01:51.178" style="s2"> It can withstand the test of time than castles and empires</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.242" end="00:01:56.234" style="s2"> This is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.234" end="00:01:59.434" style="s2"> Something so fleeting will last so long</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.550" end="00:02:03.018" style="s2"> So this is like a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.018" end="00:02:08.906" style="s2"> This is how I look at the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.906" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2"> They are like a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:11.900" style="s2"> Because basically they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.900" end="00:02:14.154" style="s2"> There are many things we don’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.154" end="00:02:16.522" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know how they came from</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.522" end="00:02:19.722" style="s2"> We don’t understand how they pieced together</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.722" end="00:02:21.325" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.325" end="00:02:25.162" style="s2"> They will have such an incredible influence on civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.900" end="00:02:28.300" style="s2"> We don’t understand why people still believe these stories</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:31.644" style="s2"> We don’t know what it means to not believe them now</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.644" end="00:02:33.250" style="s2"> Or we don’t even know</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.250" end="00:02:34.375" style="s2"> If we believe what these stories mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:40.075" style="s2"> There is another problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.025" end="00:02:44.475" style="s2"> This question is not limited to me but must be related to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.475" end="00:02:46.850" style="s2"> That is no matter how high your education is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:49.700" style="s2"> You can&#39;t accumulate enough knowledge to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.775" end="00:02:52.772" style="s2"> The Psychological Significance in the Story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.250" end="00:02:55.775" style="s2"> But i will do my best</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.175" end="00:02:59.475" style="s2"> Partly because I want to learn more about them</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.775" end="00:03:01.125" style="s2"> as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.139" end="00:03:05.235" style="s2"> One of the best ways to learn something is to tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.500" end="00:03:08.418" style="s2"> I am also thinking during my lecture</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.875" end="00:03:12.075" style="s2"> I&#39;m not trying to tell you the facts I am convinced</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:15.300" style="s2"> Because there are many things I&#39;m not sure about</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.725" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2"> I&#39;m just trying to clarify the truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.425" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2"> And I’ve been doing this for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.675" end="00:03:26.225" style="s2"> You may or may not know that I admire Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.650" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2"> Nietzsche is a powerful critic of dogmatic Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.425" end="00:03:36.200" style="s2"> This refers to the situation when Christianity was realized by institutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.300" end="00:03:39.700" style="s2"> Yet he is a paradoxical thinker</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.550" end="00:03:42.625" style="s2"> Nietzsche once said such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.275" end="00:03:47.825" style="s2"> He doesn’t believe if it’s not because of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.350" end="00:03:50.528" style="s2"> The scientific revolution will begin or succeed</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.528" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2"> To be precise, this refers to Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.950" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2"> He believes that in the course of a thousand years of history</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.350" end="00:04:04.650" style="s2"> Europeans have trained their way of thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.975" end="00:04:07.875" style="s2"> Explain everything in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.875" end="00:04:11.550" style="s2"> In a single coherent framework</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:14.600" style="s2"> If you accept the initial axiom, it is coherent</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.975" end="00:04:16.575" style="s2"> A single coherent framework</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.925" end="00:04:23.625" style="s2"> Nietzsche believed that the Catholicization of life and historical phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.725" end="00:04:28.150" style="s2"> Gave birth to a way of thinking that can surpass</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.525" end="00:04:32.825" style="s2"> Its dogmatic foundation and focus on other things</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.150" end="00:04:35.875" style="s2"> In this case it happens to be the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.675" end="00:04:40.125" style="s2"> Nietzsche felt that Christianity was buried in his own hands</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.600" end="00:04:43.575" style="s2"> And it took a long time to try to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:46.675" style="s2"> Make people aware of the need for truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.725" end="00:04:49.750" style="s2"> Keep people from falling</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.800" end="00:04:52.175" style="s2"> And the fall is often part of human attempts</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.750" end="00:04:56.575" style="s2"> The spirit of truth is developed from Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.575" end="00:04:58.875" style="s2"> But it also counteracts the foundation of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.875" end="00:05:01.275" style="s2"> Everyone mutters or thinks after waking up</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.275" end="00:05:04.325" style="s2"> Why do we start to believe these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.375" end="00:05:08.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s like one day you wake up and find</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.200" end="00:05:10.975" style="s2"> You really don’t know why a Christmas tree is erected</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.000" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2"> But you have been doing this for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.425" end="00:05:14.200" style="s2"> And this is often the behavior of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.900" end="00:05:17.675" style="s2"> The Christmas tree appeared for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.825" end="00:05:24.600" style="s2"> After the cause is forgotten, the ceremony still exists</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.025" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2"> Nietzsche is not only a critic of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.525" end="00:05:36.100" style="s2"> Is also a champion of its discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.775" end="00:05:38.450" style="s2"> Another thing Nietzsche agrees with is</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.475" end="00:05:44.300" style="s2"> You cannot be free if you were not a slave</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.675" end="00:05:46.250" style="s2"> He meant to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.250" end="00:05:51.375" style="s2"> You will not leap from childhood to mature adult personality</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.075" end="00:05:55.175" style="s2"> You will move from childhood to a state of discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.200" end="00:05:59.875" style="s2"> This can be understood as similar to self-imposed slavery</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.875" end="00:06:02.150" style="s2"> This will be the best situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:06.700" style="s2"> Before you can regain the generality of childhood</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.925" end="00:06:11.800" style="s2"> You must discipline yourself to be a certain individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.575" end="00:06:15.300" style="s2"> He believes that Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:17.925" style="s2"> Played such a role for Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.200" end="00:06:23.750" style="s2"> But at the end of the 19th century he declared &quot;God is dead&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.450" end="00:06:29.475" style="s2"> You will often hear this sentence in a triumphant tone</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.050" end="00:06:31.475" style="s2"> But not for Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:35.450" style="s2"> He is far from such a simple thinker</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:41.050" style="s2"> Nietzsche is clear and this is what I want to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.575" end="00:06:50.348" style="s2"> That’s the structure of experience we still don’t know much</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.350" end="00:06:51.725" style="s2"> We don&#39;t understand reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.950" end="00:06:55.850" style="s2"> What we have is a clear statement of the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.425" end="00:06:59.900" style="s2"> We know nothing beyond this</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.125" end="00:07:01.775" style="s2"> There is a buffer zone in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.150" end="00:07:04.350" style="s2"> This is what we seem to know</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.725" end="00:07:06.775" style="s2"> But we don’t have a clear understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.900" end="00:07:08.075" style="s2"> for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.200" end="00:07:12.150" style="s2"> When you are arguing with your relatives and friends, it coincides with a low mood</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.675" end="00:07:15.800" style="s2"> They become sensitive, irritable and unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.475" end="00:07:18.248" style="s2"> If you keep talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:21.550" style="s2"> They may suddenly stand up and even cry</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.550" end="00:07:22.300" style="s2"> When they started crying</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.300" end="00:07:23.525" style="s2"> They can understand why they are angry</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.525" end="00:07:25.300" style="s2"> And it&#39;s not because of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.300" end="00:07:28.675" style="s2"> Although you might have caused this controversy</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.925" end="00:07:31.275" style="s2"> In my opinion this is a very interesting phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.300" end="00:07:34.450" style="s2"> Because it means that people can understand others to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.450" end="00:07:37.500" style="s2"> But it is difficult to express in words</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.875" end="00:07:41.050" style="s2"> In a sense, the mind is sublimated from the body</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.350" end="00:07:44.825" style="s2"> It affects emotional video and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.425" end="00:07:48.175" style="s2"> Before we recognize a thing clearly</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.600" end="00:07:51.550" style="s2"> I can already understand it on a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.450" end="00:07:54.300" style="s2"> We have a space that can be clearly explained</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.300" end="00:07:55.650" style="s2"> Where we can discuss everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.900" end="00:07:57.100" style="s2"> But outside of this we are in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.100" end="00:08:00.375" style="s2"> Something similar to a dream we will get stuck in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.625" end="00:08:02.925" style="s2"> What we are trapped in is an emotional dream</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:05.425" style="s2"> And it is based at least in part on our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.450" end="00:08:06.275" style="s2"> I will describe this later</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.325" end="00:08:09.650" style="s2"> We don’t know anything beyond this part</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.075" end="00:08:14.650" style="s2"> This dream is where the mystics and artists live</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.000" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2"> They are the medium between the omniscience and the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.175" end="00:08:27.550" style="s2"> This means that what we know is based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.900" end="00:08:30.525" style="s2"> The form of knowledge that we don’t actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.750" end="00:08:32.475" style="s2"> If the two are not consistent</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.575" end="00:08:34.850" style="s2"> If we can articulate the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.850" end="00:08:36.500" style="s2"> If it&#39;s out of sync with our dreams</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.850" end="00:08:40.125" style="s2"> Then we will tear from the inside</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.375" end="00:08:44.400" style="s2"> What we think, what we do, what we don’t dream</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.700" end="00:08:47.500" style="s2"> This will cause a mental disorder</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.775" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2"> This mental disorder</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.300" end="00:08:53.900" style="s2"> And its antidote is something like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:57.700" style="s2"> Belief and representation</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.250" end="00:09:00.500" style="s2"> People will turn to things like ideology</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.575" end="00:09:02.275" style="s2"> This seems to me to be attached to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.275" end="00:09:04.275" style="s2"> Parasites based on underlying religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.550" end="00:09:05.900" style="s2"> In order to organize their thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.900" end="00:09:10.075" style="s2"> This disaster was what Nietzsche had foreseen</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.075" end="00:09:10.775" style="s2"> He realized</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.775" end="00:09:14.425" style="s2"> When we destroy representations</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.425" end="00:09:16.650" style="s2"> When stripping away the foundation of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.675" end="00:09:18.625" style="s2"> This representation refers to the ideal model of God</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.500" end="00:09:23.300" style="s2"> We will become unstable</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.325" end="00:09:26.225" style="s2"> Sway between nihilism and ideological extremes</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.375" end="00:09:30.225" style="s2"> He is especially concerned about the radical left ideology</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.325" end="00:09:33.625" style="s2"> And it was predicted as early as the end of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.650" end="00:09:37.925" style="s2"> This is really a shocking insight</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.350" end="00:09:41.525" style="s2"> There will be hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.525" end="00:09:46.850" style="s2"> It is precisely because it replaces this dreamlike structure that is hidden at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.850" end="00:09:48.175" style="s2"> Replaced by rational</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.775" end="00:09:52.575" style="s2"> But the extremely wrong way of expressing the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.675" end="00:09:57.725" style="s2"> We have been swinging back and forth between left and right ever since</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.025" end="00:10:01.475" style="s2"> With sporadic nihilism and despair</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.950" end="00:10:05.175" style="s2"> In a sense, this is the situation of modern Westerners</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:08.925" style="s2"> All humanity is gradually falling into it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.650" end="00:10:11.825" style="s2"> I think islam</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.825" end="00:10:15.000" style="s2"> Part of the reason for being hostile to the West is</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:17.550" style="s2"> There are many other reasons and not all of them are justified</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.550" end="00:10:19.825" style="s2"> It is certain that one of the reasons is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.225" end="00:10:24.180" style="s2"> Because they are still based on dreams</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.975" end="00:10:26.675" style="s2"> So they can see that the West has nothing to trust</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.375" end="00:10:29.000" style="s2"> Doubtful thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:32.600" style="s2"> And this threatens the integrity of their culture</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.050" end="00:10:34.225" style="s2"> And it is true</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.700" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2"> We westerners have been racking our brains to destroy the Great Wall</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.050" end="00:10:41.375" style="s2"> I&#39;m not complaining</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.400" end="00:10:45.775" style="s2"> It’s not easy to deal with this situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.850" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2"> But this disaster is not without results</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.725" end="00:10:56.150" style="s2"> It has a real impact on people’s lives</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.200" end="00:10:58.075" style="s2"> This is not very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.750" end="00:11:00.900" style="s2"> For example, I have seen and treated many times</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.925" end="00:11:02.850" style="s2"> Found in patients with depression or anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.900" end="00:11:04.700" style="s2"> They are all in an existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.300" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2"> This is not just as simple as mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.425" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2"> Their abnormality is not only caused by neurochemical disorders</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.775" end="00:11:14.975" style="s2"> Although sometimes it happens to be the reason</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.975" end="00:11:17.250" style="s2"> And the reason is that they have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.250" end="00:11:19.450" style="s2"> Overwhelmed by the pain and complexity of his life</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.500" end="00:11:23.400" style="s2"> And they are not sure if it makes sense to continue</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.400" end="00:11:27.375" style="s2"> You can feel the bad negative meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.500" end="00:11:31.375" style="s2"> So I doubt that I believe it has any positive meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.550" end="00:11:33.950" style="s2"> I have a client who is a very good artist</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.575" end="00:11:36.625" style="s2"> As long as he doesn&#39;t think, he&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.625" end="00:11:38.100" style="s2"> He will create</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.100" end="00:11:40.350" style="s2"> And he is really good at his job</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.375" end="00:11:45.350" style="s2"> His personality is to keep creating great products</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.350" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2"> But he always underestimates himself</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.900" end="00:11:50.550" style="s2"> Self-destruct</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.550" end="00:11:57.300" style="s2"> But when he started thinking about what he did</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.300" end="00:11:59.173" style="s2"> It seems to use a drill, saw or similar to break the road</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.850" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2"> He will start to criticize what he did</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.125" end="00:12:03.300" style="s2"> Think his job is useless</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.300" end="00:12:05.525" style="s2"> Although the value of his work is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.750" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2"> So he found it difficult to find motivation to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.750" end="00:12:12.400" style="s2"> As a reason and being</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.400" end="00:12:17.660" style="s2"> A great example of the consequences of a split in some way</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.200" end="00:12:23.075" style="s2"> He impressed me</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.500" end="00:12:26.725" style="s2"> He split to truly doubt his own existence value</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.725" end="00:12:30.500" style="s2"> This is really not a joke</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.175" end="00:12:34.525" style="s2"> Its seriousness lies in what it shows</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.525" end="00:12:37.350" style="s2"> Not only an individual&#39;s mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.400" end="00:12:39.425" style="s2"> And it&#39;s also a mental illness of society</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.500" end="00:12:42.750" style="s2"> The tendency of people to get involved in ideology</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.625" end="00:12:48.125" style="s2"> In my opinion it is a lame religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.150" end="00:12:49.925" style="s2"> This is the right way to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.125" end="00:12:51.950" style="s2"> They are like a religion lacking arms and legs</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.950" end="00:12:53.325" style="s2"> But still forge ahead</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.350" end="00:12:56.550" style="s2"> It creates a sense of security and group identity</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.550" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2"> But it’s deformed and crazily surly</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:03.875" style="s2"> And parasitic on some potential richness and reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.250" end="00:13:05.750" style="s2"> In short, this is how I look at it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.075" end="00:13:11.625" style="s2"> I think it’s important to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.425" end="00:13:16.075" style="s2"> I think nothing</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.125" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s more urgent than this</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:20.475" style="s2"> I have been thinking about this for a long, long time</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.825" end="00:13:25.275" style="s2"> I have been researching since the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.300" end="00:13:28.425" style="s2"> The belief system is regulating</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.425" end="00:13:31.575" style="s2"> Role in mental and social health</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.625" end="00:13:34.750" style="s2"> You can realize that it does work</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.750" end="00:13:37.425" style="s2"> Because when you challenge people’s belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.425" end="00:13:38.750" style="s2"> They will be really upset</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.300" end="00:13:40.875" style="s2"> Why do they care so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.875" end="00:13:42.100" style="s2"> Even your ideological principles</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.100" end="00:13:47.175" style="s2"> What if it is completely correct</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.800" end="00:13:49.350" style="s2"> Let’s put it this way when people’s ideological principles are pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.450" end="00:13:52.450" style="s2"> Will become very angry</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.900" end="00:13:57.975" style="s2"> Even if I exhaust my imagination, I can’t find the obvious reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.025" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2"> They are based on a basic truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:05.725" style="s2"> They are like on a raft in the middle of the sea</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.875" end="00:14:07.625" style="s2"> When you start to pull the wooden slats from the raft</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.775" end="00:14:09.950" style="s2"> They will be afraid of falling and drowning</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.625" end="00:14:11.700" style="s2"> What drowned</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.875" end="00:14:15.331" style="s2"> What is the raft protecting them from?</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.625" end="00:14:17.775" style="s2"> Why they are so afraid</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.775" end="00:14:21.075" style="s2"> Beyond the boundaries of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.350" end="00:14:22.925" style="s2"> These are not obvious things</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:27.450" style="s2"> I have tried to solve this mystery for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.725" end="00:14:30.950" style="s2"> There are some videos of my lectures on this topic on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.950" end="00:14:31.725" style="s2"> Most of you know it</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:34.125" style="s2"> Part of the content in this series of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.200" end="00:14:35.075" style="s2"> You have heard of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.075" end="00:14:37.000" style="s2"> If you watch those videos</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.250" end="00:14:40.300" style="s2"> But I want to try to explain from some other angles</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.700" end="00:14:44.375" style="s2"> Nietzsche’s view is human</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.375" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2"> Is to create its own value</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.925" end="00:14:49.550" style="s2"> He knows we all have bodies</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:51.525" style="s2"> Motivation and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.675" end="00:14:54.125" style="s2"> In a way he is a romantic thinker</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.125" end="00:14:55.375" style="s2"> But far beyond his time</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.725" end="00:14:58.200" style="s2"> He understands our ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.225" end="00:15:00.025" style="s2"> Not a free floating soul</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.025" end="00:15:02.725" style="s2"> But is deeply rooted in our physiology</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.350" end="00:15:04.625" style="s2"> Subject to our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.650" end="00:15:06.950" style="s2"> Shaped by our motivation and body</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.950" end="00:15:07.925" style="s2"> He understands this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.925" end="00:15:12.325" style="s2"> But he also believes that the only way to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.525" end="00:15:16.300" style="s2"> For us humans, it becomes close to God</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.300" end="00:15:18.275" style="s2"> And create its own value</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.050" end="00:15:23.625" style="s2"> He will create his own value</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.625" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2"> Called &quot;Superman&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:28.475" style="s2"> This is what the Nazis used to arm their superior national ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.475" end="00:15:35.575" style="s2"> Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:39.650" style="s2"> We all know what happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.650" end="00:15:41.800" style="s2"> Obviously nothing good happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.050" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2"> I also spent a lot of time reading a lot of Carl Jung’s books</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.900" end="00:15:47.825" style="s2"> It is through him</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.925" end="00:15:50.625" style="s2"> And Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.625" end="00:15:55.025" style="s2"> I just started to realize our clear thought system</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.875" end="00:15:58.025" style="s2"> Is deeply rooted in something like a dream</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.550" end="00:16:00.250" style="s2"> This dream is through a complicated way</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.525" end="00:16:02.575" style="s2"> Affected by our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2"> We often don’t understand what we show through our actions</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:08.850" style="s2"> If this is not true</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.850" end="00:16:12.250" style="s2"> We don’t need psychology, sociology or anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.325" end="00:16:12.950" style="s2"> These are unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.950" end="00:16:15.300" style="s2"> Because we have fully understood ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.575" end="00:16:16.725" style="s2"> And obviously we are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.500" end="00:16:20.350" style="s2"> We are far more complicated than we know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.375" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2"> This means that in our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.025" end="00:16:25.125" style="s2"> There are too many things we don’t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.625" end="00:16:29.225" style="s2"> A part of the dream that surrounds us with clear cognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.225" end="00:16:33.825" style="s2"> Formed by observing each other’s behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:37.475" style="s2"> And tell it into a story and pass it on to all generations</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.850" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2"> Extract the behavioral patterns that shape human nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.775" end="00:16:44.475" style="s2"> And try to show it</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.125" end="00:16:46.525" style="s2"> Partly through imitation</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.550" end="00:16:49.875" style="s2"> But also through drama, mythology, literature and art, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.975" end="00:16:51.375" style="s2"> Show what we are like</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.375" end="00:16:53.150" style="s2"> So we can understand what we are like</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.575" end="00:16:57.250" style="s2"> This is what I read from the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:16:59.550" style="s2"> At least part of the cognitive process shown in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.550" end="00:17:03.550" style="s2"> It is hesitant, one-sided, clumsy and contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.050" end="00:17:07.250" style="s2"> This is one of the reasons that makes this book complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.375" end="00:17:10.900" style="s2"> But from it I also interpret that humanity is in the animal ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.900" end="00:17:14.700" style="s2"> The struggle has found a way out</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.175" end="00:17:17.625" style="s2"> Then realized what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:19.225" style="s2"> And this is a very difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.225" end="00:17:20.925" style="s2"> Because we don&#39;t know who we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.925" end="00:17:22.425" style="s2"> What are we or where do we come from</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.950" end="00:17:26.800" style="s2"> Life is an uninterrupted chain</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.825" end="00:17:28.575" style="s2"> Can be traced back to 3.5 billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.575" end="00:17:30.225" style="s2"> It&#39;s pretty incredible</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.250" end="00:17:32.575" style="s2"> The ancestors of everyone here</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.575" end="00:17:35.900" style="s2"> Have successfully reproduced for 3.5 billion years</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.200" end="00:17:37.925" style="s2"> It&#39;s pretty incredible</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.225" end="00:17:40.075" style="s2"> We grow from the soil and silt</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.075" end="00:17:41.325" style="s2"> Become what it is now</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.375" end="00:17:43.575" style="s2"> We realized but failed to know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.100" end="00:17:45.925" style="s2"> And try to figure out who we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.175" end="00:17:51.050" style="s2"> A series of stories we have told for 3000 years</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:53.100" style="s2"> It seems to me that there is a deep meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.700" end="00:17:57.350" style="s2"> When I study the &quot;Bible&quot; story to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.400" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2"> Started with a beginner mentality</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.750" end="00:18:03.225" style="s2"> This book is really a mystery how it was made into a book</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.225" end="00:18:05.100" style="s2"> Why should it be written and why should we save it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.425" end="00:18:08.375" style="s2"> Why does it happen to inspire a culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.375" end="00:18:11.275" style="s2"> For two thousand years and changed the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.575" end="00:18:13.500" style="s2"> What happened and how did it happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.850" end="00:18:15.375" style="s2"> It can&#39;t be obvious</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.475" end="00:18:19.275" style="s2"> There is one thing in the sloppy comments on religion that bothers me</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.275" end="00:18:21.825" style="s2"> That is they don’t take this phenomenon seriously</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.900" end="00:18:23.700" style="s2"> This is a serious phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.650" end="00:18:27.950" style="s2"> Especially because people have the ability to get religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.950" end="00:18:29.250" style="s2"> But no one knows the reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.275" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2"> You can stimulate religious experience in various reliable ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.650" end="00:18:34.425" style="s2"> You can do it by stimulating the brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.600" end="00:18:38.375" style="s2"> Of course it can also be achieved through drugs, especially psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.375" end="00:18:43.075" style="s2"> It can induce a close union with the divine very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.100" end="00:18:46.900" style="s2"> Only God knows how long people have used hallucinogenic drugs</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.900" end="00:18:49.050" style="s2"> It&#39;s about 50,000 years, maybe even longer</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.325" end="00:18:50.850" style="s2"> It is used to induce a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.275" end="00:18:53.125" style="s2"> A close connection with the divine</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.650" end="00:18:54.975" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.975" end="00:18:57.400" style="s2"> When we discovered psychedelic drugs in the late 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.675" end="00:18:59.050" style="s2"> It shocked everyone deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.050" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2"> So that it was immediately classified as illegal</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.700" end="00:19:04.100" style="s2"> And it is forbidden to use it for research for nearly 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.100" end="00:19:08.550" style="s2"> It’s no wonder because no one can think of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.575" end="00:19:14.950" style="s2"> Jung was a scholar of Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.950" end="00:19:19.500" style="s2"> But he is also a sharp critic of Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.800" end="00:19:21.425" style="s2"> He was cultivated by Freud</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.250" end="00:19:29.150" style="s2"> Freud began to collect the information we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.525" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2"> This information is about the concept of people living in dreams</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.716" style="s2"> It was Freud who polarized the subconscious view</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.175" end="00:19:40.050" style="s2"> Now we take it for granted to a point</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.050" end="00:19:41.175" style="s2"> So that we don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.425" end="00:19:42.900" style="s2"> How revolutionary this view was at the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.900" end="00:19:44.550" style="s2"> For Freud&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.850" end="00:19:49.675" style="s2"> We used to go to the rough</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.550" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2"> Now when we mention Freud, we only consider his fur</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.450" end="00:19:55.450" style="s2"> Because this is the part that was abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.475" end="00:19:56.950" style="s2"> But many of his discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.950" end="00:19:58.725" style="s2"> Have become part of our current popular concepts</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.925" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2"> Include a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.025" end="00:20:02.850" style="s2"> That is your perception, behavior and thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.850" end="00:20:08.950" style="s2"> Are all influenced and shaped by subconscious motives</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.950" end="00:20:11.800" style="s2"> But not under your control</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.800" end="00:20:13.750" style="s2"> It&#39;s so weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.850" end="00:20:15.625" style="s2"> This is the psychoanalytic theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.050" end="00:20:18.025" style="s2"> One of the most disturbing things</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.375" end="00:20:20.175" style="s2"> Psychoanalytic theory can be understood like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.525" end="00:20:24.375" style="s2"> You are a loose collection of active sub-personality</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.375" end="00:20:25.650" style="s2"> Each of them has its own set</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.650" end="00:20:29.000" style="s2"> Motivation, perception of emotion and logical basis</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.250" end="00:20:32.275" style="s2"> And you have limited control over them</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.475" end="00:20:36.425" style="s2"> You are like a collection</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.425" end="00:20:38.900" style="s2"> Inside are some loosely assembled personalities</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.050" end="00:20:39.775" style="s2"> You know it well</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.800" end="00:20:42.725" style="s2"> Because you can&#39;t control yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.725" end="00:20:44.675" style="s2"> This is what Jung argued for Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.675" end="00:20:47.525" style="s2"> Refutation of the view that &quot;we can create our own value&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.725" end="00:20:48.950" style="s2"> Jung did not believe this</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.400" end="00:20:51.425" style="s2"> Especially after breaking with Freud</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.425" end="00:20:55.875" style="s2"> Because he realized that human beings are deeply affected by</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.875" end="00:20:58.675" style="s2"> Influenced by something outside the control of subjective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.975" end="00:21:01.375" style="s2"> No one really knows how to define these things</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.875" end="00:21:06.275" style="s2"> Cognitive psychologists identify it as a computing machine</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:09.225" style="s2"> The ancients understood it as a deity</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.225" end="00:21:10.725" style="s2"> Although the facts are more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.925" end="00:21:14.200" style="s2"> Mars is considered the god of anger</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.200" end="00:21:16.550" style="s2"> When you are angry you will be possessed by him</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.850" end="00:21:20.300" style="s2"> This makes sense and it says what I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.300" end="00:21:23.250" style="s2"> This may be when you notice</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:24.650" style="s2"> What you want to say doesn&#39;t matter much</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.950" end="00:21:27.550" style="s2"> It&#39;s not only in you, everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.550" end="00:21:30.500" style="s2"> And it will last forever and even exist in animals</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.125" end="00:21:34.775" style="s2"> This is a transcendent mental entity</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.975" end="00:21:38.275" style="s2"> It was born in a whole nation</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.275" end="00:21:40.700" style="s2"> Just as a thought occupies the brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.700" end="00:21:42.250" style="s2"> This is a way to interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.550" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2"> This is a very strange way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:46.675" style="s2"> But it does have its advantages</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.400" end="00:21:50.325" style="s2"> These things are gods in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.325" end="00:21:51.775" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not that simple</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.375" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2"> Jung is very interested in dreams</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:21:59.775" style="s2"> Then he began to understand the relationship between dreams and myths</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.650" end="00:22:03.100" style="s2"> Then he found his client’s dream</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.375" end="00:22:05.150" style="s2"> Always echoes the fairy tales</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:07.025" style="s2"> He once studied mythology deeply</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.350" end="00:22:10.775" style="s2"> He began to believe that dreams are the birthplace of myths</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.800" end="00:22:14.525" style="s2"> There is a continuous interaction between these two programs</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.525" end="00:22:17.675" style="s2"> From dream to story to narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.850" end="00:22:21.400" style="s2"> When you can remember the dream, you can tell it as a story</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.725" end="00:22:23.725" style="s2"> Some people can remember all the dreams he had</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.975" end="00:22:25.100" style="s2"> There can be two or three in one night</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.150" end="00:22:26.525" style="s2"> I have had customers like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.775" end="00:22:30.250" style="s2"> They often have prototype dreams with a clear mythological framework</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.300" end="00:22:31.275" style="s2"> I think this situation is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.275" end="00:22:32.725" style="s2"> More common among creative people</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.325" end="00:22:36.325" style="s2"> Especially when they were not emotionally stable at the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.325" end="00:22:38.100" style="s2"> Because dreams always tend to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.150" end="00:22:40.375" style="s2"> Take up uncertain space</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.625" end="00:22:42.625" style="s2"> And focus on what you haven’t really understood</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.775" end="00:22:46.200" style="s2"> To visualize an unknown reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:49.075" style="s2"> So dreams are the birthplace of myths</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.300" end="00:22:50.650" style="s2"> This is a good angle of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.100" end="00:22:54.200" style="s2"> Because it is not so clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.200" end="00:22:56.625" style="s2"> It is trying to define something</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.775" end="00:23:00.800" style="s2"> Jung has a concept called &quot;post-Freud&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.800" end="00:23:02.950" style="s2"> There is a hidden dream</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.950" end="00:23:04.475" style="s2"> Internal review mechanism for true information</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.500" end="00:23:05.750" style="s2"> Jung didn’t think so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.775" end="00:23:10.825" style="s2"> He believes that dreams express reality to the best of their ability</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.825" end="00:23:13.950" style="s2"> And this is still fully articulate</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.950" end="00:23:15.425" style="s2"> Perceptible understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.275" end="00:23:19.025" style="s2"> Think about it, don’t you think an idea came to mind?</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.025" end="00:23:19.775" style="s2"> It&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.775" end="00:23:22.300" style="s2"> Bang this is something you never wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.300" end="00:23:23.775" style="s2"> What does this mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:25.925" style="s2"> Just a thought that flashed through my mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.100" end="00:23:28.475" style="s2"> This explanation is ridiculous too</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.725" end="00:23:33.875" style="s2"> There is no use at all, where did the idea come from</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.100" end="00:23:36.950" style="s2"> Oh nowhere just appeared</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.875" end="00:23:40.625" style="s2"> It seems that this is really not a strict explanation</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.125" end="00:23:44.750" style="s2"> You may think about the ideas you have in mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.750" end="00:23:45.850" style="s2"> So where did these ideas come from</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.225" end="00:23:47.675" style="s2"> They are often the thoughts of other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.800" end="00:23:49.025" style="s2"> People who have been dead for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.050" end="00:23:50.025" style="s2"> Partly like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.100" end="00:23:52.725" style="s2"> Like the words you use to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.725" end="00:23:55.275" style="s2"> From the mouth of someone who has long since passed away</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.175" end="00:23:58.700" style="s2"> You are under the influence of your ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.700" end="00:24:00.500" style="s2"> This is a way to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.675" end="00:24:03.150" style="s2"> Your motivation emotion</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.150" end="00:24:04.839" style="s2"> And the body are communicating with you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.675" style="s2"> And these are achieved through dreams</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.475" end="00:24:13.225" style="s2"> Dreams are the birthplace of ideas that can be fully expressed</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.125" end="00:24:16.725" style="s2"> They are not rootless trees</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.000" end="00:24:18.550" style="s2"> They all have a developmental origin</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.550" end="00:24:22.425" style="s2"> And only God knows how long that origin is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.425" end="00:24:25.300" style="s2"> Even for example, I said &quot;I am conscious&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.575" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2"> Chimps don’t even say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.275" end="00:24:33.025" style="s2"> About 7 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.025" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2"> We parted ways with the chimpanzees from the common ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.575" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2"> They have no knowledge that can be articulated</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.500" end="00:24:40.850" style="s2"> Almost no self-expression ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.225" end="00:24:45.375" style="s2"> There is almost no self-awareness and we are not at all like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:48.850" style="s2"> In the course of 7 million years</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.850" end="00:24:51.400" style="s2"> We must work hard to figure out all this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.925" end="00:24:57.025" style="s2"> I think a part of it is an ancient story</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.075" end="00:24:59.225" style="s2"> Performance and record</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.225" end="00:25:03.875" style="s2"> I think especially the oldest stories in &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.875" end="00:25:05.775" style="s2"> This is what we are going to start deciphering</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.825" end="00:25:11.325" style="s2"> Some ancient natures of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.325" end="00:25:13.150" style="s2"> Are included in these stories</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.350" end="00:25:16.675" style="s2"> In my opinion they are very enlightening</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.925" end="00:25:18.225" style="s2"> Give a simple example</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.225" end="00:25:22.650" style="s2"> There is a concept of &quot;sacrifice&quot; in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.125" end="00:25:24.225" style="s2"> Quite brutal</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.150" end="00:25:27.400" style="s2"> The story of Abraham and Isaac is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.925" end="00:25:30.600" style="s2"> Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.900" end="00:25:32.125" style="s2"> This is not like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.125" end="00:25:34.475" style="s2"> What a reasonable god can make</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.950" end="00:25:35.975" style="s2"> God in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.975" end="00:25:40.800" style="s2"> It is often cruel, ruthless and arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:43.775" style="s2"> This is what gives this book life</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.300" end="00:25:46.300" style="s2"> It is certainly not edited by a committee</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.875" end="00:25:51.925" style="s2"> Because a committee will consider to avoid offending anyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.625" end="00:26:09.000" style="s2"> In short, Jung believes that dreams are the birthplace of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.725" end="00:26:11.250" style="s2"> I have been expanding this idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.250" end="00:26:14.350" style="s2"> Because there is something that makes me curious</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.675" end="00:26:17.900" style="s2"> You have a dream and then find someone to interpret the dream</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:20.675" style="s2"> You can dispute the correctness of the explanation</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.700" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2"> Just as you can argue about the explanation of a movie or novel</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.425" end="00:26:29.950" style="s2"> It’s really hard to judge its accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.350" end="00:26:32.350" style="s2"> This is also part of the reason for the criticism of postmodernism</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.800" end="00:26:37.875" style="s2"> According to my observation, people will show a dream</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.900" end="00:26:39.400" style="s2"> And then we can occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.400" end="00:26:41.175" style="s2"> Extract real and useful information</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.175" end="00:26:43.525" style="s2"> But this person doesn&#39;t seem to know</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.975" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2"> But there was a glimmer of insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.425" end="00:26:47.425" style="s2"> For me this is a signal</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.450" end="00:26:49.275" style="s2"> Mark something we accidentally discovered</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.500" end="00:26:50.700" style="s2"> That is before someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.725" end="00:26:52.575" style="s2"> Split something combined</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.575" end="00:26:53.850" style="s2"> It can reround the broken mirror</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.925" end="00:26:55.800" style="s2"> Like a good story</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.800" end="00:26:57.175" style="s2"> Or a good theory can do the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.175" end="00:26:58.925" style="s2"> Things are all at once</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.925" end="00:27:01.650" style="s2"> At the same time a small light</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.650" end="00:27:03.575" style="s2"> This is what I use at home</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:08.025" style="s2"> Signals to determine accuracy and dream interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.325" end="00:27:10.500" style="s2"> When I was just married</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.025" end="00:27:12.525" style="s2"> I often quarrel with my wife</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.525" end="00:27:17.081" style="s2"> I&#39;m very impatient in my heart</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.081" end="00:27:18.700" style="s2"> Then I will shoot the case</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.175" end="00:27:22.725" style="s2"> Get upset about what we are arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.725" end="00:27:25.275" style="s2"> Then she will go to sleep, which is really maddening</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.625" end="00:27:29.650" style="s2"> I&#39;m annoying why I can&#39;t sleep</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.450" end="00:27:31.975" style="s2"> Gnawing nails in a hurry</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.050" end="00:27:34.525" style="s2"> And she was asleep beside me</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.575" end="00:27:35.475" style="s2"> I&#39;m really going crazy</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2"> But she often dreams</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.250" end="00:27:40.525" style="s2"> We will discuss her dream the next morning</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.625" end="00:27:43.300" style="s2"> We can solve the crux of the previous argument</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.575" end="00:27:44.850" style="s2"> This is really very useful</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.900" end="00:27:47.075" style="s2"> Even though it was so quarrelsome before</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:50.875" style="s2"> So I was convinced by Jung</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.875" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2"> Tell me about his dreams, myths, dramas and literature</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2"> View of the connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.875" end="00:27:57.400" style="s2"> Makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.425" end="00:28:00.575" style="s2"> The same goes for his views on the relationship between people and art</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.825" end="00:28:02.225" style="s2"> I know an aboriginal sculptor</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.250" end="00:28:04.075" style="s2"> He is a Kwakwajakwa tribe</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.375" end="00:28:05.550" style="s2"> His works include</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.925" end="00:28:08.775" style="s2"> Wood carving totem poles and masks, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.900" end="00:28:10.075" style="s2"> I also collected some at home</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.325" end="00:28:11.875" style="s2"> He is a very interesting person</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.150" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2"> Almost illiterate</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:16.050" style="s2"> And focus on</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.050" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2"> This ancient tradition that has continued for 13,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.025" end="00:28:20.325" style="s2"> He speaks the original language</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.650" end="00:28:22.825" style="s2"> And he is illiterate</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.825" end="00:28:24.575" style="s2"> Makes him think a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.575" end="00:28:26.525" style="s2"> People who lived in the pre-writing period</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.525" end="00:28:28.275" style="s2"> People in the pre-text period are not stupid</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.275" end="00:28:29.125" style="s2"> They just can&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.175" end="00:28:32.175" style="s2"> Their brain organization is very different from ours</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.600" end="00:28:36.025" style="s2"> I once asked him where his carving inspiration came from</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.025" end="00:28:39.250" style="s2"> He told me that I got it through dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.750" end="00:28:40.875" style="s2"> You have all seen Haida masks</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.025" end="00:28:42.050" style="s2"> Know what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.625" end="00:28:45.925" style="s2"> His ethnicity is closely related to the Haida ethnic group</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.275" end="00:28:47.700" style="s2"> Basically the same style</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.700" end="00:28:53.100" style="s2"> He said he would dream about animals and remember dreams</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.475" end="00:28:55.500" style="s2"> He was still talking to his grandparents in his dream</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.500" end="00:28:57.500" style="s2"> They will teach him how to carve</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.575" end="00:29:00.025" style="s2"> This happens often if he encounters problems in carving</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.025" end="00:29:01.043" style="s2"> His grandparents will appear in the dream</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.043" end="00:29:02.018" style="s2"> He will discuss the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.275" end="00:29:05.250" style="s2"> In his eyes the animals he wants to carve</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.425" end="00:29:09.175" style="s2"> Is to live vividly in imagination</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.575" end="00:29:12.925" style="s2"> It’s not difficult to understand. First of all I have no reason not to believe him</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.925" end="00:29:14.350" style="s2"> He is a very upright person</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.375" end="00:29:18.250" style="s2"> And I don’t think he has any motivation or scheming</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.250" end="00:29:20.575" style="s2"> To make up a story like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.000" end="00:29:22.900" style="s2"> He doesn&#39;t make sense to do this</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.250" end="00:29:25.250" style="s2"> I don’t think he will talk to others everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.275" end="00:29:26.625" style="s2"> Because he also thought it was a bit crazy</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.025" end="00:29:29.475" style="s2"> When he was a kid he thought he was crazy</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.525" end="00:29:34.525" style="s2"> Because he always dreams of these animals</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.050" end="00:29:36.350" style="s2"> He is not what he wants to show off</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.950" end="00:29:39.250" style="s2"> It makes me very fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.250" end="00:29:40.900" style="s2"> Because i can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.975" end="00:29:43.925" style="s2"> Shows an unbroken tradition in him</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.225" end="00:29:45.750" style="s2"> We don’t know this tradition at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.750" end="00:29:48.525" style="s2"> How did it pass on for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.100" end="00:29:51.425" style="s2"> Partly by oral delivery and memory</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.725" end="00:29:53.400" style="s2"> Partly by performing it in a theatrical form</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.400" end="00:29:55.400" style="s2"> Part of it depends on imagination</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.200" end="00:29:58.200" style="s2"> How illiterate people store knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.200" end="00:29:59.475" style="s2"> Totally different from us</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.475" end="00:30:00.350" style="s2"> We don&#39;t remember anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.350" end="00:30:01.725" style="s2"> We all write in the book</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.400" end="00:30:03.625" style="s2"> But if you come from an oral traditional culture</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.925" end="00:30:05.275" style="s2"> Especially if you have been trained in oral tradition</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.350" end="00:30:07.400" style="s2"> You will have all the information in your head</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.900" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2"> So that you can speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:10.325" style="s2"> Then you can tell these stories</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.425" end="00:30:11.750" style="s2"> And can really understand them</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.875" end="00:30:14.300" style="s2"> Modern people can&#39;t think of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.475" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2"> I suspect that there may not be more than two of you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:20.325" style="s2"> Able to recite 30 lines of poems fluently</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.850" end="00:30:23.450" style="s2"> The purpose of poetry is to enable people to recite</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.875" end="00:30:25.925" style="s2"> This is why we have such a literary form</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.925" end="00:30:28.975" style="s2"> So that people can memorize it and keep it in their minds at any time</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.175" end="00:30:30.550" style="s2"> But now we don’t do it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:33.050" style="s2"> Closer to home, let&#39;s go back to Jung</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.300" end="00:30:37.025" style="s2"> Jung values ​​the value of dreams very much</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.025" end="00:30:40.150" style="s2"> I know dreams can tell what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.050" end="00:30:42.200" style="s2"> How is this possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.250" end="00:30:45.800" style="s2"> What do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.800" end="00:30:47.950" style="s2"> Tell what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.025" end="00:30:49.475" style="s2"> How can it make sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.950" end="00:30:52.600" style="s2"> First of all why can&#39;t you understand it</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.600" end="00:30:55.275" style="s2"> Why is it displayed in the form of a dream</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.475" end="00:30:58.075" style="s2"> It’s like there is something in your body</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.075" end="00:30:59.175" style="s2"> Things you can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:02.700" style="s2"> Dreams look like real life to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.900" end="00:31:04.950" style="s2"> There is a strange kind of person who can have lucid dreams</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.175" end="00:31:07.725" style="s2"> In other words, they can remain partly conscious in their dreams</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.725" end="00:31:11.000" style="s2"> But most of the time you are lying down and sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.000" end="00:31:15.500" style="s2"> And this crazy and complicated world is inside you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.500" end="00:31:17.775" style="s2"> Showing but you don&#39;t know how it happened</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.800" end="00:31:19.525" style="s2"> You can&#39;t do it when you are awake</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.200" end="00:31:21.475" style="s2"> And you don&#39;t know what it means</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.475" end="00:31:23.125" style="s2"> What exactly is going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.125" end="00:31:24.725" style="s2"> This is what you can learn from psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.725" end="00:31:26.075" style="s2"> Such a terrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.625" end="00:31:29.855" style="s2"> You can see it from Freud and Jung</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.875" end="00:31:31.500" style="s2"> You will start to really recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.500" end="00:31:35.525" style="s2"> Something in you is controlling you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.675" end="00:31:37.000" style="s2"> Instead of you controlling them</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.150" end="00:31:39.450" style="s2"> You can do a little bit of mutual control</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.800" end="00:31:41.875" style="s2"> But there is always some kind of &quot;spirit&quot; display</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.875" end="00:31:42.675" style="s2"> Let&#39;s just say so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.975" end="00:31:45.375" style="s2"> The spirit in your body determines your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.400" end="00:31:48.650" style="s2"> Just spend your life like this and you can&#39;t control it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.775" end="00:31:51.802" style="s2"> What is this? Is it random?</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.850" end="00:31:54.025" style="s2"> Some people claim dreams</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.025" end="00:31:57.350" style="s2"> It’s just the result of a random reflex</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.375" end="00:31:59.450" style="s2"> I think this theory is really nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.450" end="00:32:02.125" style="s2"> Because dreams are not random events at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.675" end="00:32:06.900" style="s2"> Dreams are very organized and very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.175" end="00:32:09.575" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like snowflakes on the TV screen</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.575" end="00:32:13.145" style="s2"> Or the noise on the radio is actually quite complicated</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.525" end="00:32:17.100" style="s2"> I often see people who can dream a series of very coherent dreams</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.125" end="00:32:18.900" style="s2"> These dreams have a complete narrative structure</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.275" end="00:32:21.450" style="s2"> To some extent, they are very mature stories</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.450" end="00:32:24.350" style="s2"> So that theory doesn’t make sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.350" end="00:32:26.775" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s useless to say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.025" end="00:32:32.050" style="s2"> So I want to take this phenomenon seriously</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.200" end="00:32:34.350" style="s2"> There is such a situation in my dream</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.550" end="00:32:37.375" style="s2"> You dreamed of the future and you managed to realize it</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.400" end="00:32:39.300" style="s2"> It seems not a trivial matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.825" end="00:32:42.850" style="s2"> Or you had a nightmare and then realized it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.850" end="00:32:44.225" style="s2"> Because people do</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.275" end="00:32:45.825" style="s2"> Like if they are determined to get revenge</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:47.725" style="s2"> And full of resentment and hatred</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.225" end="00:32:50.975" style="s2"> These will show up in bad fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.550" end="00:32:53.800" style="s2"> Dream first and then people put it into action</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.350" end="00:32:55.525" style="s2"> It is full of power</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.725" end="00:32:58.825" style="s2"> The whole nation can be involved in the collective dream</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.825" end="00:33:03.325" style="s2"> This is what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.325" end="00:33:08.025" style="s2"> That is really an extraordinary sight that shocked the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.025" end="00:33:09.875" style="s2"> The same thing happened in the Soviet Union and other places</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.100" end="00:33:13.500" style="s2"> You have to take these things seriously</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.550" end="00:33:16.325" style="s2"> You need to find ways to figure out what happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.375" end="00:33:21.075" style="s2"> What Jung thought the dream might contain</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.075" end="00:33:24.125" style="s2"> More than clearly understood so far</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.525" end="00:33:27.300" style="s2"> I think the artist is doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.325" end="00:33:30.400" style="s2"> People go to the museum to admire the paintings</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.725" end="00:33:32.450" style="s2"> Whether it’s Renaissance painting or modern painting</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.500" end="00:33:34.375" style="s2"> They are not very clear about the appearance of these paintings</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.800" end="00:33:42.175" style="s2"> I&#39;ve been to a museum in New York filled with Renaissance art</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.600" end="00:33:44.900" style="s2"> Are all great painters and even the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:46.950" style="s2"> I think the collection in that room may be worth a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.950" end="00:33:48.325" style="s2"> Even its value far exceeds this</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.325" end="00:33:51.325" style="s2"> Because there are about 20 paintings that are priceless</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.875" end="00:33:54.775" style="s2"> First of all, there is a question because these paintings are so valuable</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.050" end="00:33:56.225" style="s2"> Why in the largest city in the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.225" end="00:33:58.325" style="s2"> Will build an exhibition hall for these paintings</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.325" end="00:33:59.950" style="s2"> Why people from all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.950" end="00:34:00.975" style="s2"> Want to visit here</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.350" end="00:34:02.800" style="s2"> What are they doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:06.700" style="s2"> One of the paintings is &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, which is beautifully painted</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.700" end="00:34:09.328" style="s2"> What a shining artwork</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.328" end="00:34:12.170" style="s2"> There are about 20 people standing in front of this painting and watching</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.425" end="00:34:15.125" style="s2"> What are they doing they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.125" end="00:34:16.550" style="s2"> Why do they go to the Holy Land in New York</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.550" end="00:34:18.550" style="s2"> Visit the painting specially</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.900" end="00:34:20.300" style="s2"> They don&#39;t seem to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.300" end="00:34:21.525" style="s2"> Why is this painting so valuable</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.525" end="00:34:23.425" style="s2"> I know the status of this painting is extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.425" end="00:34:24.550" style="s2"> But this raises another question</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.975" end="00:34:27.850" style="s2"> Why is this item&#39;s status so high</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.175" end="00:34:30.775" style="s2"> What is so extraordinary about them</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.200" end="00:34:33.550" style="s2"> We are weird creatures</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.225" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2"> I tried to figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:39.900" style="s2"> Where did the information in the dream come from</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.575" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2"> Must have its source</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.025" end="00:34:43.975" style="s2"> You can think of it as a revelation</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.450" end="00:34:47.375" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s like something out of nothing</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.450" end="00:34:49.325" style="s2"> And contains new knowledge and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.325" end="00:34:51.725" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t make it, it just appeared</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.275" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2"> This is one thing I want to take seriously</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:34:57.550" style="s2"> I am a person with scientific thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.550" end="00:34:59.050" style="s2"> And I&#39;m still a very rational person</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.050" end="00:35:02.875" style="s2"> Before I seek any other type of explanation</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.925" end="00:35:05.125" style="s2"> I tend to explain things with reason and experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.400" end="00:35:07.725" style="s2"> I&#39;m not talking about everything related to divinity</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.725" end="00:35:10.275" style="s2"> Can be resolved</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.275" end="00:35:11.150" style="s2"> It can be resolved into another form</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.150" end="00:35:13.975" style="s2"> Such as the evolutionary history of biology, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.975" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2"> But as long as it can be resolved</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.975" end="00:35:18.975" style="s2"> I will do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.625" end="00:35:23.350" style="s2"> But I will keep other phenomena in a metaphysical state</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.400" end="00:35:24.650" style="s2"> Because they cannot be defined</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.675" end="00:35:25.950" style="s2"> In this category</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.950" end="00:35:29.125" style="s2"> I will define it as mystical and religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.125" end="00:35:30.475" style="s2"> These are things we don’t understand at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.925" end="00:35:35.700" style="s2"> The artists will observe each other as well as people</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.475" end="00:35:38.625" style="s2"> And then they show what they see</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.675" end="00:35:41.525" style="s2"> And pass this information to us</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.525" end="00:35:42.725" style="s2"> It taught us how to see and observe</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.725" end="00:35:43.875" style="s2"> We don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.200" end="00:35:45.875" style="s2"> What we learned from them</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.575" end="00:35:47.675" style="s2"> But we did learn something</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.675" end="00:35:49.775" style="s2"> At least we acted like we were learning something</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.100" end="00:35:51.675" style="s2"> We watch movies non-stop</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:55.450" style="s2"> Read stories and immerse yourself in the fictional world</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.450" end="00:35:58.325" style="s2"> This is a work of art for many people</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.650" end="00:36:00.900" style="s2"> The art world is a living world</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.925" end="00:36:01.950" style="s2"> If you are a creative person</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.975" end="00:36:03.450" style="s2"> Then this point is particularly correct</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.875" end="00:36:05.450" style="s2"> It is the creative artists</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.450" end="00:36:08.975" style="s2"> Is promoting the development of human knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.050" end="00:36:11.275" style="s2"> First they will do this with their artwork</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.325" end="00:36:12.175" style="s2"> They are testing on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.425" end="00:36:16.100" style="s2"> Dancer, Poet, Visual Artist</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.150" end="00:36:17.725" style="s2"> And the musicians are doing this</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.725" end="00:36:19.575" style="s2"> But we are not sure what they are doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.575" end="00:36:21.350" style="s2"> We are not sure what the musicians are doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.350" end="00:36:22.175" style="s2"> What are they doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.175" end="00:36:23.125" style="s2"> Why do you like music</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.775" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2"> It will give you a deep hint of the meaning of things</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.825" end="00:36:29.075" style="s2"> no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.075" end="00:36:30.825" style="s2"> When you go to the concert, you feel an upsurge</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.850" end="00:36:33.125" style="s2"> This is a kind of religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.125" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2"> Especially when people really cheer up</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2"> And push the whole group forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:39.525" style="s2"> There is something very strong in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.525" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2"> But I don’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.800" end="00:36:43.700" style="s2"> This is not easy to understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.125" end="00:36:45.700" style="s2"> Music is very regular</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.050" end="00:36:48.200" style="s2"> And is regular on many levels</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.500" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think this is irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.075" end="00:36:53.475" style="s2"> Because reality is also regular on many levels</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.875" style="s2"> I think music expresses reality in a basic way</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.875" end="00:37:01.850" style="s2"> We will be controlled by it and participate in it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.875" end="00:37:05.325" style="s2"> This is part of what makes this experience so exciting</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.325" end="00:37:07.850" style="s2"> But we don’t really realize what we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.850" end="00:37:11.625" style="s2"> We did it without thinking and this is also nourishing people</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.625" end="00:37:16.700" style="s2"> Especially young people, many young people enjoy music very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.725" end="00:37:18.050" style="s2"> Where they get their own meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.050" end="00:37:19.350" style="s2"> And the source of cultural identity</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.350" end="00:37:20.900" style="s2"> Everything that can nourish people</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.900" end="00:37:23.250" style="s2"> Are inseparable from the connection with music</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.250" end="00:37:24.950" style="s2"> Because it is part of their cultural identity</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.300" end="00:37:26.600" style="s2"> This is really a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.775" end="00:37:31.350" style="s2"> But the question is still not answered</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.375" end="00:37:33.100" style="s2"> Where did the information in the dream come from</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.150" end="00:37:36.700" style="s2"> I think it passed</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.700" end="00:37:42.675" style="s2"> We observe everyone’s behavior patterns</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.325" end="00:37:44.525" style="s2"> We have been observing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.525" end="00:37:47.250" style="s2"> We also observed</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.250" end="00:37:49.450" style="s2"> Part of our cultural history</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.450" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2"> This is what is deeply embedded in fictional works</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.650" end="00:37:53.925" style="s2"> Such as about good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.925" end="00:37:55.875" style="s2"> The story of the bad and the good and love</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.150" style="s2"> These are the typical modes of existence of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.150" end="00:38:00.775" style="s2"> And affect us deeply</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.775" end="00:38:02.050" style="s2"> Because they represent</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.050" end="00:38:03.925" style="s2"> What we do in this world</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.175" end="00:38:06.700" style="s2"> What we learned about</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.700" end="00:38:08.525" style="s2"> Individual information about yourself and others to visualize it</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.075" end="00:38:14.900" style="s2"> In the long river of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.900" end="00:38:19.075" style="s2"> There will be waves of behavior patterns of some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.075" end="00:38:22.150" style="s2"> Great dramas are also staged in the crowd over time</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.425" end="00:38:26.350" style="s2"> The artists observed and realized the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.350" end="00:38:28.125" style="s2"> They will record it and tell us</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.125" end="00:38:30.225" style="s2"> Then we have a clearer understanding of our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.050" end="00:38:33.475" style="s2"> A great playwright like Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.775" end="00:38:35.250" style="s2"> We all know that his works are all fiction</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.250" end="00:38:37.375" style="s2"> Then we will say that the fictional works are not real</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.875" end="00:38:39.250" style="s2"> But think about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.575" end="00:38:41.875" style="s2"> It may be as real as a number</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.975" end="00:38:45.725" style="s2"> Numbers are abstracted from potential reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.725" end="00:38:47.450" style="s2"> But there is no sane person</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.450" end="00:38:49.600" style="s2"> Would say that the numbers are not real</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.900" end="00:38:50.875" style="s2"> You can even think like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.875" end="00:38:54.325" style="s2"> Numbers are more real than things show</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.700" end="00:38:57.150" style="s2"> Because this abstraction is too powerful</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.275" end="00:39:02.225" style="s2"> You can use math to move the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.925" end="00:39:04.648" style="s2"> Abstract is not more real than concrete reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.675" end="00:39:09.550" style="s2"> This is not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.900" end="00:39:11.300" style="s2"> When you watch a movie like &quot;Hamlet&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.325" end="00:39:12.525" style="s2"> When such fictional works</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.525" end="00:39:14.700" style="s2"> You will think it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.750" end="00:39:15.950" style="s2"> Because this is a fictional work</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.975" end="00:39:17.000" style="s2"> But you feel like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.000" end="00:39:18.550" style="s2"> What is the explanation</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:21.000" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s more real than non-fiction works</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.500" end="00:39:24.550" style="s2"> You need a story to tell yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.550" end="00:39:26.125" style="s2"> This story to be told also needs</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.150" end="00:39:28.150" style="s2"> About you and each of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.150" end="00:39:29.625" style="s2"> This story will abstract it and show it</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.876" end="00:39:33.976" style="s2"> This is the key part of human experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.275" end="00:39:39.675" style="s2"> This is what is abstracted from the noisy matrix</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.025" end="00:39:44.075" style="s2"> People get infected because they can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.100" end="00:39:46.900" style="s2"> It shows part of their mode of existence</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.250" end="00:39:48.525" style="s2"> This is the correct way to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.350" end="00:39:51.475" style="s2"> Accompanying these ancient stories</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.475" end="00:39:55.475" style="s2"> It seems to me that this process has been carried out for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.500" end="00:39:57.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s like we observe ourselves first</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.475" end="00:39:59.250" style="s2"> Then extract some stories like</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.250" end="00:40:02.540" style="s2"> We imitate each other and show it in the drama</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.540" end="00:40:07.400" style="s2"> Then we extract some essence from these dramas</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.400" end="00:40:10.325" style="s2"> Repeat and complete the process</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.525" end="00:40:12.625" style="s2"> God knows how long we spent</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.150" end="00:40:14.475" style="s2"> I think part of these stories</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.600" end="00:40:18.575" style="s2"> Someone has traced some fairy tales back to ten thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.325" end="00:40:20.875" style="s2"> It exists in a relatively unchanging form</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.350" end="00:40:24.600" style="s2"> In my opinion, the archaeological evidence must</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.625" end="00:40:26.975" style="s2"> Shows those very old stories</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:29.500" style="s2"> Like the stories in the beginning of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.500" end="00:40:31.325" style="s2"> At least a story as old as them</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.375" end="00:40:34.750" style="s2"> It may be deeply rooted in prehistoric history long before them</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.825" end="00:40:38.075" style="s2"> You may ask how can you be so sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:39.650" style="s2"> I can answer at least part of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.650" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2"> That is, the ancient civilization will not change quickly</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.075" style="s2"> They stay the same, this is the answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.350" end="00:40:51.750" style="s2"> Their information is passed on from generation to generation</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.750" end="00:40:53.462" style="s2"> They stay the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:58.775" style="s2"> We know that there are archaeological discoveries and some rituals are almost complete</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.775" end="00:41:01.400" style="s2"> Lasted for nearly 20,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.750" end="00:41:03.675" style="s2"> Someone found in a cave in Japan</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.675" end="00:41:06.025" style="s2"> Which has a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.025" end="00:41:09.450" style="s2"> The bear worship ceremony also has the characteristics of Western Europe</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.725" end="00:41:12.075" style="s2"> So these things can last for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.600" end="00:41:18.200" style="s2"> We are observing each other in this world</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.900" end="00:41:20.300" style="s2"> Then the problem is coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.300" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2"> How long ago did we observe each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.500" end="00:41:24.075" style="s2"> In a sense the answer to this question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.075" end="00:41:27.625" style="s2"> Since the existence of a creature with a nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.450" end="00:41:29.925" style="s2"> And this is a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.925" end="00:41:31.650" style="s2"> Hundreds of millions of years have passed</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.725" end="00:41:32.900" style="s2"> May be longer</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.300" end="00:41:34.550" style="s2"> We have been observing each other throughout this time course</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.550" end="00:41:37.775" style="s2"> Trying to figure out what each other is doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.125" end="00:41:40.350" style="s2"> Some of this knowledge is already built into your body</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.350" end="00:41:42.700" style="s2"> Like this is why we can dance with other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.625" end="00:41:49.125" style="s2"> Understanding is not an abstract concept that you understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.175" end="00:41:50.525" style="s2"> It’s what you show in your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.175" end="00:41:53.950" style="s2"> This is what children are doing when they learn to chase and fight</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.075" end="00:41:56.275" style="s2"> They are learning how to in a harmonious way</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.275" end="00:41:59.375" style="s2"> Integrate yourself with the bodies of others</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.375" end="00:42:00.600" style="s2"> So as to learn to work together and achieve goals</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.650" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2"> And these are manifested through their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.725" end="00:42:04.875" style="s2"> This is not abstract knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.125" end="00:42:06.675" style="s2"> They don&#39;t know what they are doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.925" end="00:42:07.850" style="s2"> They did that anyway</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.550" end="00:42:09.800" style="s2"> We can even move our body</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.825" end="00:42:11.650" style="s2"> Used as a display platform</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.475" end="00:42:14.700" style="s2"> We have been studying each other for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.950" end="00:42:22.500" style="s2"> Analyze what we are doing and what we should do</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.550" end="00:42:24.275" style="s2"> Here is a more basic question</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.600" end="00:42:26.075" style="s2"> If you want to survive in this world</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.075" end="00:42:27.450" style="s2"> You have to behave appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.100" end="00:42:29.050" style="s2"> What does it mean to be so decent</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.050" end="00:42:31.350" style="s2"> What can you do about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.350" end="00:42:33.475" style="s2"> This question is right</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.725" end="00:42:35.250" style="s2"> This is what we all want to know</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.325" end="00:42:36.450" style="s2"> How do you survive in the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.450" end="00:42:38.075" style="s2"> This is not how the world is made up</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.100" end="00:42:39.425" style="s2"> We one yard into one yard</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.600" end="00:42:40.775" style="s2"> How do you survive in the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.300" end="00:42:43.175" style="s2"> This is an eternal problem for humans</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.450" end="00:42:45.025" style="s2"> I guess we are the only one</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.025" end="00:42:46.950" style="s2"> The species that really asked this question</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.250" end="00:42:49.675" style="s2"> All other animals just do anything without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.075" end="00:42:55.075" style="s2"> And we’re not like this. It’s our own problem. We have to be aware of this.</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.075" end="00:43:00.675" style="s2"> We have to say it, God knows why, but this seems to be the case.</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.725" end="00:43:08.575" style="s2"> Our behavior is shaped by the world and society</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.625" end="00:43:11.275" style="s2"> Shaped into something we don’t understand but we can use it as a model to emulate</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.950" end="00:43:15.675" style="s2"> We imitate it in the story and imitate it with our body</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.475" end="00:43:18.675" style="s2"> This is the source of dream information</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.175" end="00:43:20.575" style="s2"> Dream is involved in this process</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.625" end="00:43:23.825" style="s2"> Observe everything and try to express it systematically</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.850" end="00:43:27.175" style="s2"> It tries to get the signal from the noise</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.225" end="00:43:28.525" style="s2"> And depicted in a dramatic form</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.525" end="00:43:30.250" style="s2"> Because a dream is a little drama</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.450" end="00:43:34.350" style="s2"> Then you have a chance to talk about what dreams are</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.350" end="00:43:38.975" style="s2"> Then you will get systematic knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.825" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2"> I think the existence of the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:49.550" style="s2"> It&#39;s like this between dreams and systematic knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.950" end="00:43:52.275" style="s2"> Explore in the story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.350" end="00:43:58.525" style="s2"> The meaning helps us understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.725" end="00:44:02.550" style="s2"> Also suppose Nietzsche is right</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.550" end="00:44:06.383" style="s2"> Jung and Dostoyevsky are right</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:12.300" style="s2"> Then there is no cornerstone provided by this self-understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.475" end="00:44:13.300" style="s2"> We are lost</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.950" end="00:44:15.550" style="s2"> This is very bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.550" end="00:44:20.523" style="s2"> Because in this way we will be vulnerable to mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.100" end="00:44:27.025" style="s2"> Those who firmly oppose religious ideas</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.400" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2"> Seems to think so</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.025" style="s2"> If we give up immersing in the potential dream</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.025" end="00:44:34.150" style="s2"> We can immediately become like</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:35.650" style="s2"> Rationalists like Descartes and Bacon</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.575" end="00:44:40.075" style="s2"> Become a very clever, clear, rational and scientific person</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.325" end="00:44:41.650" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.650" end="00:44:43.600" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think there is any evidence to support this</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.625" end="00:44:46.525" style="s2"> I think we will lose our minds sharply</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.525" end="00:44:48.975" style="s2"> So that the most bizarre mystery in Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.975" end="00:44:52.350" style="s2"> Seem to become relatively positive and rational</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.350" end="00:44:54.075" style="s2"> And I think this is already happening</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.525" end="00:45:08.750" style="s2"> This is the general concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.350" end="00:45:10.675" style="s2"> For you there is an unknown world</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.750" end="00:45:13.250" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.325" end="00:45:15.525" style="s2"> It&#39;s like an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.525" end="00:45:17.550" style="s2"> Surround the island where you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.600" end="00:45:18.475" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.475" end="00:45:19.575" style="s2"> It is chaos itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.025" end="00:45:23.175" style="s2"> You are acting in that world</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.175" end="00:45:24.450" style="s2"> But your behavior is not known to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.525" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2"> There is much more in your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.700" end="00:45:27.125" style="s2"> What you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.350" end="00:45:28.475" style="s2"> Jung made a point</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.500" end="00:45:30.325" style="s2"> I liked it when I first understood it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.350" end="00:45:32.200" style="s2"> He said that everyone is acting out a myth</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.850" end="00:45:34.825" style="s2"> But few people know what their myth is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.225" end="00:45:36.550" style="s2"> You should understand your myth</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.550" end="00:45:38.150" style="s2"> Because it might be a tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.750" end="00:45:40.375" style="s2"> Maybe you don&#39;t want it to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.775" end="00:45:42.925" style="s2"> This is indeed something worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.925" end="00:45:46.350" style="s2"> Because your behavior pattern shapes your character</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.400" end="00:45:48.775" style="s2"> God knows where you got it from</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.275" end="00:45:51.925" style="s2"> Part of the reason is biologically inherited from your parents</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.325" end="00:45:53.525" style="s2"> This is burdened by you unintentionally</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.550" end="00:45:56.325" style="s2"> This is how the philosophy of your society makes you</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.525" end="00:45:59.800" style="s2"> And it&#39;s aiming you somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.850" end="00:46:02.775" style="s2"> Is the place you are being targeted for suits your wishes?</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.050" end="00:46:04.150" style="s2"> This is a good question</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:06.025" style="s2"> This is part of self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.850" end="00:46:09.050" style="s2"> We know we don&#39;t understand our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.025" end="00:46:12.500" style="s2"> Almost all your arguments with others are related to this</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.550" end="00:46:14.475" style="s2"> Such as why did you do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.550" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2"> You will come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.250" end="00:46:17.100" style="s2"> Ambiguous reasons to explain your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.425" end="00:46:18.975" style="s2"> You are like wandering in the dark</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.975" end="00:46:21.225" style="s2"> You want to give yourself a reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.800" end="00:46:23.025" style="s2"> But can&#39;t do it completely</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.100" end="00:46:24.275" style="s2"> It&#39;s very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.275" end="00:46:27.700" style="s2"> Because you are a complicated animal</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.725" end="00:46:32.075" style="s2"> It’s just that I have a clear mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.375" end="00:46:34.225" style="s2"> Your existence is far beyond your control</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.625" end="00:46:40.775" style="s2"> You can put something into action</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.650" end="00:46:42.875" style="s2"> This can be regarded as an ability</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.925" end="00:46:45.450" style="s2"> Then you will imagine what you put into action</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.475" end="00:46:47.425" style="s2"> I also think about what other people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.900" end="00:46:51.000" style="s2"> There is a lot of information in your actions</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.325" end="00:46:54.700" style="s2"> Then this information is transformed into dreams</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.725" end="00:46:56.425" style="s2"> Then presented in the form of art mythology and literature</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.425" end="00:46:59.725" style="s2"> This contains a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.050" end="00:47:04.200" style="s2"> And part of it is translated into clear thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.325" end="00:47:06.450" style="s2"> Let me give a simple example</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.450" end="00:47:08.450" style="s2"> I think part of it is reflected in &quot;Exodus&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.900" end="00:47:10.650" style="s2"> When Moses wrote the law</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.025" end="00:47:13.775" style="s2"> He was wandering in the desert with the Israelis</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.775" end="00:47:17.025" style="s2"> They sway and worship idols</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.025" end="00:47:20.925" style="s2"> Began to become rebellious during this difficult time course</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.525" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2"> Moses climbed up the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.300" style="s2"> And get great revelation from God</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.675" end="00:47:29.150" style="s2"> He was inspired by the enlightenment and finally went down the mountain holding the law</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.425" end="00:47:32.100" style="s2"> Moses acted as an arbiter in the desert</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.175" end="00:47:36.200" style="s2"> I know this is a fairy tale</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.225" end="00:47:37.700" style="s2"> He keeps on</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.700" end="00:47:39.525" style="s2"> Mediation between people who have problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.525" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2"> Keep working hard to maintain peace</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.800" end="00:47:43.775" style="s2"> What are you doing when you try to keep the peace</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.875" end="00:47:45.750" style="s2"> You will try to understand what peace is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.200" end="00:47:48.125" style="s2"> You have to apply some principles</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.425" end="00:47:49.475" style="s2"> What are these principles</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:50.725" style="s2"> Ok you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.950" end="00:47:52.100" style="s2"> These principles are to make people satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.100" end="00:47:54.375" style="s2"> So as to make peace by shaking hands</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.875" end="00:47:56.600" style="s2"> Maybe you need to try 10,000 times</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.600" end="00:47:59.900" style="s2"> In order to slowly understand which principles can bring peace</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.350" end="00:48:04.200" style="s2"> One day it will flash in your mind like a revelation</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.350" end="00:48:07.025" style="s2"> So these are the rules we have been following</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.425" end="00:48:08.625" style="s2"> This is the Ten Commandments</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.725" end="00:48:10.175" style="s2"> This is the place to start</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.525" end="00:48:12.325" style="s2"> Moses stepped forward and said</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.500" end="00:48:14.875" style="s2"> This is basically what we have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.875" end="00:48:16.250" style="s2"> It’s just that it’s now compiled into a law</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.550" end="00:48:21.450" style="s2"> This is the entire historical process condensed into a single story</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.450" end="00:48:23.050" style="s2"> But obviously this is how it happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.050" end="00:48:25.025" style="s2"> Because we already have a written law</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.625" end="00:48:28.525" style="s2"> Under a good legal system</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.525" end="00:48:29.875" style="s2"> The law germinates from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.200" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2"> This is how the common law system works</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.775" end="00:48:37.175" style="s2"> A single judgment is based on existing principles</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.575" end="00:48:40.350" style="s2"> Then clarify it and include it in the legal system</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.675" end="00:48:42.750" style="s2"> The legal system is what you put into practice</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.750" end="00:48:44.950" style="s2"> This is why it became a legal system</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.375" end="00:48:46.150" style="s2"> This is why if you are a good citizen</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.150" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2"> You will act in accordance with the legal system</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.250" end="00:48:49.925" style="s2"> The legal system contains principles</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.525" end="00:48:51.825" style="s2"> So the problem is coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.275" end="00:48:56.150" style="s2"> What are the principles that guide our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:49:00.150" style="s2"> I think when you initialize</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.150" end="00:49:03.800" style="s2"> The deep meaning of God in the eyes of ancient Israel</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:06.100" style="s2"> That’s what they meant to point out</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.575" end="00:49:08.225" style="s2"> This is not a good enough explanation</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.275" end="00:49:13.025" style="s2"> But imagine when you are a chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:18.125" style="s2"> At the top of your society</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.125" end="00:49:19.650" style="s2"> Have a strong ruler</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.900" end="00:49:22.550" style="s2"> It represents power even more than this</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.850" end="00:49:24.774" style="s2"> Because keeping a chimpanzee at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.774" end="00:49:26.758" style="s2"> It takes more than physical strength</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.775" end="00:49:28.275" style="s2"> It&#39;s far more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.825" end="00:49:34.100" style="s2"> You can say that this ruler revealed a certain principle</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.300" end="00:49:39.450" style="s2"> Then you will say if you know ten authority figures</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.475" end="00:49:43.050" style="s2"> This principle can be more brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:46.650" style="s2"> Then you can extract an authority concept from it</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.675" end="00:49:48.775" style="s2"> You can extract a concept of power</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.775" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2"> Then you can separate the concept from the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.000" end="00:49:54.375" style="s2"> We have to do this sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.375" end="00:49:57.700" style="s2"> Because we can say that power in a human context</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.700" end="00:49:59.225" style="s2"> We can also imagine what this means</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.225" end="00:50:03.250" style="s2"> But it is separated from any concrete representation of power</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.400" end="00:50:06.825" style="s2"> Why on earth are we doing this is too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.175" end="00:50:11.025" style="s2"> If you are an orangutan and the powerful one is another orangutan</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.025" end="00:50:13.025" style="s2"> This is not an abstract concept</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.800" end="00:50:16.150" style="s2"> The problem is to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.150" end="00:50:17.900" style="s2"> We all live under various hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.900" end="00:50:19.325" style="s2"> Some of them lasted for hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.575" end="00:50:21.950" style="s2"> We are trying to figure out what the guiding principles are</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.175" end="00:50:25.675" style="s2"> Try to extract the core of the guiding principles</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:29.625" style="s2"> And express it in a mode of existence</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.925" end="00:50:32.425" style="s2"> Something like this this is god</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.700" end="00:50:34.975" style="s2"> This is an abstract ideal model</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.675" end="00:50:41.238" style="s2"> It manifests as a form of personification</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.238" end="00:50:44.775" style="s2"> It’s okay because in a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.875" end="00:50:45.900" style="s2"> We are all trying to figure out what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.925" end="00:50:51.475" style="s2"> Means to be functional and socially decent</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.750" end="00:50:53.725" style="s2"> And the essence of the capable individual</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.800" end="00:50:55.475" style="s2"> We are trying to figure out what it means</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.800" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2"> You need a concrete avatar</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:00.650" style="s2"> You need to abstract an ideal model</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.750" end="00:51:02.125" style="s2"> So you can put it into practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.350" end="00:51:03.875" style="s2"> Then it can make you understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.900" end="00:51:04.900" style="s2"> What does this substance mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.250" end="00:51:06.825" style="s2"> This is our intention</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.150" end="00:51:09.626" style="s2"> This is the first hypothesis to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.975" end="00:51:14.175" style="s2"> I am going to talk about some characteristics of this abstract ideal model</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.200" end="00:51:15.450" style="s2"> This ideal model has been shaped by us as God</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.450" end="00:51:17.850" style="s2"> But this is the first assumption</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.275" end="00:51:22.900" style="s2"> The ideal model of philosophy or morality first presents itself as</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.900" end="00:51:24.975" style="s2"> A real behavioral pattern</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.025" end="00:51:27.125" style="s2"> This is a typical characteristic of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.675" end="00:51:29.600" style="s2"> Then it became some individuals</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.950" end="00:51:32.275" style="s2"> And then abstract from these individuals</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.725" end="00:51:34.325" style="s2"> Finally you have this abstract concept</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.325" end="00:51:35.225" style="s2"> And this is very important</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.500" end="00:51:37.875" style="s2"> Here is an example of its political significance</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.675" end="00:51:48.475" style="s2"> We can say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.475" end="00:51:52.700" style="s2"> There was a debate between the early Christian church and the late Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.050" end="00:51:56.750" style="s2"> That is whether an emperor can become a god</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.000" end="00:52:00.850" style="s2"> Truly deify it and enshrine it in the temple</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.700" end="00:52:03.700" style="s2"> You can now realize why this happened</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.025" end="00:52:05.225" style="s2"> This is something proud of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.225" end="00:52:06.925" style="s2"> A man at the pinnacle of an extremely concentrated hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.925" end="00:52:08.900" style="s2"> He has power in the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.175" end="00:52:11.750" style="s2"> Christian answer is</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.600" end="00:52:15.650" style="s2"> Never assign a specific ruler</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.075" end="00:52:19.750" style="s2"> Confuse with the principles of rule itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:21.275" style="s2"> This is simply wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.800" end="00:52:22.975" style="s2"> You can understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.975" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2"> How difficult is this?</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.425" end="00:52:26.450" style="s2"> Even if it’s a powerful person</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.475" end="00:52:32.325" style="s2"> Have to submit to a certain divine principle</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.350" end="00:52:33.450" style="s2"> Can&#39;t think of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.975" end="00:52:37.875" style="s2"> Even the king himself must obey this principle</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.250" end="00:52:40.225" style="s2"> We still think so because we firmly believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.225" end="00:52:43.800" style="s2"> Our President and Prime Minister cannot be above the law</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.150" end="00:52:45.550" style="s2"> No matter what the legal system is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.575" end="00:52:47.075" style="s2"> There must be one</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.075" end="00:52:49.950" style="s2"> Principles that even leaders must obey</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.225" end="00:52:51.775" style="s2"> If even this is missing, you can think</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.800" end="00:52:53.300" style="s2"> You haven&#39;t even lived in a civilized society</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.300" end="00:52:55.625" style="s2"> Because your leader will suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.650" end="00:52:58.325" style="s2"> Transcendence and omnipotence</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.675" end="00:53:00.725" style="s2"> This is clearly in the Soviet Union and</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.125" end="00:53:04.050" style="s2"> What happened in Nazi Germany and other places</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.275" end="00:53:07.825" style="s2"> Those in power can be said to be lawless</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.600" end="00:53:10.525" style="s2"> You should succumb to god</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.900" end="00:53:11.875" style="s2"> What does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.025" end="00:53:14.050" style="s2"> We need to split it up and analyze it</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.050" end="00:53:15.450" style="s2"> But part of the meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.450" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2"> Even if you are a ruler you have to obey</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:20.150" style="s2"> Principle of domination itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.650" end="00:53:21.600" style="s2"> Then the problem comes again</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.600" end="00:53:23.775" style="s2"> What is the principle of governance?</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.775" end="00:53:25.475" style="s2"> I want to say on this issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.475" end="00:53:27.600" style="s2"> We have been searching for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.300" end="00:53:30.500" style="s2"> This is what we are going to talk about next</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.300" end="00:53:33.925" style="s2"> Ancient Mesopotamians and Ancient Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.950" end="00:53:35.800" style="s2"> There are some very interesting things on this issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.425" end="00:53:38.625" style="s2"> Dramatic view</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:42.875" style="s2"> Let me give you a simple example</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.875" end="00:53:45.450" style="s2"> Once upon a time there was a deity called Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.075" end="00:53:48.825" style="s2"> Marduk was once a deity in Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.825" end="00:53:51.750" style="s2"> Imagine this is what happened</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.750" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2"> An empire was established in the post-Ice Age</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:58.775" style="s2"> That&#39;s 1-15,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.125" end="00:54:00.525" style="s2"> All the tribes have gathered</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.575" end="00:54:02.475" style="s2"> These tribes have their own deities</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.500" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2"> Have their own ideal image</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:06.625" style="s2"> But they started to occupy the same territory</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.600" end="00:54:10.650" style="s2"> One tribe has deity A and the other has deity B</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.375" end="00:54:13.875" style="s2"> And one of them can destroy the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.175" end="00:54:16.075" style="s2"> Let’s suppose that God A wins</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.325" end="00:54:17.300" style="s2"> This is not so good</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.325" end="00:54:19.250" style="s2"> Because you might want to trade with these people</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.300" end="00:54:20.625" style="s2"> Or maybe you don’t want to be in war</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.625" end="00:54:23.300" style="s2"> Reasons like losing half of the population</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.425" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2"> Then you are in an argument</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.275" end="00:54:28.500" style="s2"> Whose god is</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.500" end="00:54:30.350" style="s2"> Which ideal model will take the first place</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.650" end="00:54:33.800" style="s2"> This seems to be in myth</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.800" end="00:54:36.750" style="s2"> Portrayed as the battle of the heavenly gods</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.475" end="00:54:38.875" style="s2"> From a practical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.875" end="00:54:40.475" style="s2"> This is more like a continuous conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.650" end="00:54:41.975" style="s2"> You believe this i believe this</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.975" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2"> You believe that i believe this</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.250" end="00:54:46.200" style="s2"> How can we merge</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.550" end="00:54:48.975" style="s2"> You will take away deity A you will take away deity B</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.225" end="00:54:50.250" style="s2"> Then you might get from both</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.250" end="00:54:53.150" style="s2"> Extract a deity C and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.150" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2"> Deity C has the characteristics of both deity A and deity B</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.300" end="00:54:57.700" style="s2"> Then other tribes started to join</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.125" end="00:55:00.125" style="s2"> Deity C also took over these deities</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.650" end="00:55:04.172" style="s2"> Marduk is an example. He has many names</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.450" end="00:55:06.550" style="s2"> He has 50 names and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.800" end="00:55:09.300" style="s2"> At least part of it belongs to its subordinate god</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.300" end="00:55:10.600" style="s2"> These names symbolize</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.600" end="00:55:12.725" style="s2"> The various tribes gathered to create the entire civilization</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.200" end="00:55:14.175" style="s2"> This is a model of abstract ideals</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.175" end="00:55:16.975" style="s2"> Part of the process</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.300" end="00:55:18.075" style="s2"> You will think this is important</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.075" end="00:55:23.425" style="s2"> This works because your tribe is still alive</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.975" end="00:55:25.675" style="s2"> Then we draw on the strengths of both</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.675" end="00:55:26.750" style="s2"> If we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:28.925" style="s2"> Then extract a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.925" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2"> Can include more abstract concepts of both parties if we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.750" end="00:55:35.075" style="s2"> There is something interesting about Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.375" end="00:55:37.775" style="s2"> I will introduce you some of his characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.775" end="00:55:40.525" style="s2"> He has eyes all around his head</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.050" end="00:55:43.475" style="s2"> He is the king of the gods recommended by the gods</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.600" end="00:55:44.275" style="s2"> This is the first feature</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:45.300" style="s2"> Pretty awesome</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.625" end="00:55:46.250" style="s2"> Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.250" end="00:55:48.775" style="s2"> Because they face a terrible threat</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.050" end="00:55:52.350" style="s2"> Something like a combination of a beast and a flood</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.650" end="00:55:53.900" style="s2"> Marduk probably said</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.900" end="00:55:55.400" style="s2"> If they choose him as the head of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.725" end="00:55:58.325" style="s2"> He will stop the scourge</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.550" end="00:56:00.575" style="s2"> Save them from extinction</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.575" end="00:56:01.675" style="s2"> This is a serious threat</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.800" end="00:56:04.350" style="s2"> It&#39;s the chaos itself that makes it comeback</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.750" end="00:56:06.025" style="s2"> The gods agreed</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.350" end="00:56:08.600" style="s2"> Thus Marduk became the new main god</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.600" end="00:56:10.350" style="s2"> He has eyes all around his head</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.675" end="00:56:12.050" style="s2"> Spit out the spell</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.750" end="00:56:15.425" style="s2"> He will also take the initiative when he fights</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.475" end="00:56:17.050" style="s2"> The god against him is called Diamat</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.325" end="00:56:18.825" style="s2"> We need to know this</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.825" end="00:56:20.125" style="s2"> Because of the word &quot;diamat&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.450" end="00:56:22.525" style="s2"> Related to the word &quot;Abyss&quot; in English</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.450" end="00:56:27.050" style="s2"> The abyss is the beginning of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.075" end="00:56:29.500" style="s2"> God created the chaos of order</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:32.200" style="s2"> So it is closely related to this story</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.475" end="00:56:33.925" style="s2"> Marduk took his all-seeing eye</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.925" end="00:56:36.525" style="s2"> And the ability to vomit spells strikes</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.525" end="00:56:37.650" style="s2"> And Diamatt went hand in hand</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.750" end="00:56:40.800" style="s2"> Diamat seems to be some kind of ocean dragon</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.700" end="00:56:45.175" style="s2"> This is a classic St. George story</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.250" end="00:56:48.675" style="s2"> Punish the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.050" end="00:56:50.475" style="s2"> Marduk chopped it into pieces</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.075" end="00:56:52.675" style="s2"> And created the world with her corpse</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.875" end="00:56:54.850" style="s2"> This is the world that humans inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.150" end="00:56:57.650" style="s2"> The emperor of Mesopotamia is Marduk descended to earth</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.775" end="00:57:00.675" style="s2"> As long as he is a good Marduk, he can sit on the throne</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.450" end="00:57:02.475" style="s2"> This means that around his head</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.475" end="00:57:05.000" style="s2"> Have eyes and vomit curses</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.050" end="00:57:06.525" style="s2"> He must talk appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.725" end="00:57:10.825" style="s2"> At this time we began to understand the essence of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.350" end="00:57:12.575" style="s2"> Because what is leadership</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.125" end="00:57:15.725" style="s2"> This is the ability to recognize the situation at hand</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.925" end="00:57:17.100" style="s2"> I might even have to watch six ways and listen to all directions</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.275" end="00:57:19.950" style="s2"> Maybe you need to use words decently</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.950" end="00:57:23.665" style="s2"> The ability to turn chaos into order</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.200" end="00:57:26.075" style="s2"> Only God knows Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.075" end="00:57:27.900" style="s2"> How long did it take to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.325" end="00:57:30.175" style="s2"> All they can do is to dramatize it</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.175" end="00:57:32.650" style="s2"> It&#39;s really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.125" end="00:57:35.250" style="s2"> And it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.250" end="00:57:38.575" style="s2"> Chaos is really a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.900" end="00:57:41.625" style="s2"> This is the chaos that God wants to solve at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.250" end="00:57:45.950" style="s2"> Chaos is both psychological and de facto existence</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.475" end="00:57:48.100" style="s2"> It cannot be accurately described in other ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.325" end="00:57:50.700" style="s2"> The moment you face chaos</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.750" end="00:57:52.850" style="s2"> When you are hit hard and lost</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.525" end="00:57:54.875" style="s2"> When your world falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.300" end="00:57:57.775" style="s2"> When you encounter something that pierces your heart</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.800" end="00:57:59.950" style="s2"> When your dreams are shattered and betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.175" end="00:58:03.625" style="s2"> Chaos emerged from it trying to swallow everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.650" end="00:58:06.525" style="s2"> No doubt this is too heavy for you</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.775" end="00:58:10.250" style="s2"> It drags you into the habitat of evil dragons in the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.275" end="00:58:11.950" style="s2"> In that situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.950" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2"> What you have is the ability to look around with round eyes</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.300" end="00:58:17.475" style="s2"> And you need to do your best to speak carefully and speak clearly</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.525" end="00:58:18.225" style="s2"> And if you are lucky enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.300" end="00:58:20.650" style="s2"> You can survive the storm</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:24.100" style="s2"> It took a long time for people to figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:27.700" style="s2"> In my opinion this view is from</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.775" end="00:58:30.225" style="s2"> Established in the survival criteria of our ancient ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.225" end="00:58:32.225" style="s2"> Maybe this happened tens of millions of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.300" end="00:58:34.075" style="s2"> Because when we are still using the same cognitive system</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.325" end="00:58:36.950" style="s2"> This reflects the deep anxiety in our hearts</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.125" end="00:58:38.425" style="s2"> At that time this system was used</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.425" end="00:58:44.500" style="s2"> Representing snakes and other predators</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.025" end="00:58:47.600" style="s2"> We are all flesh and blood</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.375" end="00:58:51.125" style="s2"> We develop the ability to abstract things</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.150" end="00:58:52.275" style="s2"> Abstract language</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.350" end="00:58:53.700" style="s2"> Singular abilities</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.800" end="00:58:55.875" style="s2"> But we still retain the deep cognitive system</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.250" end="00:58:59.125" style="s2"> That existed when we were animals</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.575" end="00:59:01.450" style="s2"> We have to use these existing systems</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.500" end="00:59:03.400" style="s2"> Emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.500" end="00:59:05.700" style="s2"> Part of the reason for the formation of the incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.975" end="00:59:07.325" style="s2"> We can demonize</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.325" end="00:59:09.825" style="s2"> Part of the reason for the enemies who disrupt our code of conduct</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.850" end="00:59:13.375" style="s2"> Because we recognize them as predators</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.625" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2"> We follow the same cognitive system</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.825" end="00:59:18.575" style="s2"> This is the chaos itself threatening us all the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.125" end="00:59:20.975" style="s2"> This is 60 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.975" end="00:59:23.700" style="s2"> Those snakes climbing on the tree where we live</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.900" end="00:59:25.075" style="s2"> This is basically the same system</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.250" end="00:59:29.100" style="s2"> Part of Marduk&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.100" end="00:59:30.875" style="s2"> Is about using insight and words</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.250" end="00:59:35.600" style="s2"> The story of dealing with the most imminent threat</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.025" end="00:59:39.400" style="s2"> Some of them are real world threats</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.925" end="00:59:41.775" style="s2"> And some are psychological threats</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.775" end="00:59:43.225" style="s2"> The threat levels of the two are comparable</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.275" end="00:59:44.650" style="s2"> But the psychological threat is far from abstract</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.850" end="00:59:47.250" style="s2"> But we are still using the same system to represent them</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.500" end="00:59:49.250" style="s2"> This is why you freeze when you are frightened</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.050" end="00:59:51.275" style="s2"> You are a prey</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.275" end="00:59:52.100" style="s2"> You are like a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.700" end="00:59:55.025" style="s2"> I saw something coming to eat you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.025" end="00:59:57.700" style="s2"> You are frightened and paralyzed</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.700" end="01:00:00.025" style="s2"> You become a stone statue</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.025" end="01:00:01.125" style="s2"> This is what happens when you see a snakehead</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.125" end="01:00:02.925" style="s2"> What happens when Medusa</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.375" end="01:00:04.300" style="s2"> You will become a stone statue</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.300" end="01:00:06.575" style="s2"> The reason you are paralyzed is</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.600" end="01:00:10.825" style="s2"> You are still using the predator detection system to protect yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.825" end="01:00:14.125" style="s2"> Your heart rate rises and ready to move</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.150" end="01:00:18.825" style="s2"> We are all upset by this system</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.825" end="01:00:21.375" style="s2"> Take the story of Marduk as an example</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.375" end="01:00:24.200" style="s2"> Its purpose is if something upsets you</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.225" end="01:00:27.275" style="s2"> Like the horror of the chaos that threatens you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.275" end="01:00:29.025" style="s2"> Serpentine beast of the underworld</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.650" end="01:00:30.375" style="s2"> Your best strategy is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.375" end="01:00:33.325" style="s2"> Organize language with eyes wide open</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.350" end="01:00:36.125" style="s2"> Then go out and face the strange shape to create a new world</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.325" end="01:00:37.925" style="s2"> This is really shocking</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.000" end="01:00:40.375" style="s2"> When I read this story and started to understand it</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.625" end="01:00:41.725" style="s2"> Really initiating</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.325" end="01:00:43.675" style="s2"> This is really a profound insight</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.675" end="01:00:44.575" style="s2"> And we also know that</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.575" end="01:00:46.150" style="s2"> Because in psychotherapy we know</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.150" end="01:00:48.550" style="s2"> It&#39;s better to face fear bravely than</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.550" end="01:00:53.325" style="s2"> Let fear come to your door to improve your body and mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.425" end="01:00:56.275" style="s2"> If you are a psychologist, part of your work</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.275" end="01:00:59.325" style="s2"> Is to smash those fears into small pieces</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.450" end="01:01:00.875" style="s2"> The things that upset them</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.875" end="01:01:03.750" style="s2"> Then face them one by one to conquer them</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.325" end="01:01:06.725" style="s2"> You are conquering in your heart</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.875" end="01:01:08.875" style="s2"> This process in the strange and chaotic world</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.550" end="01:01:12.250" style="s2"> The above are all building background</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.475" end="01:01:15.050" style="s2"> We haven’t even started talking about the first sentence in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.625" end="01:01:24.450" style="s2"> But the above are all building background</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.625" end="01:01:29.450" style="s2"> We extract from the entire historical process</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.450" end="01:01:34.525" style="s2"> This series is full of false repetitions and weird stories</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.900" end="01:01:38.500" style="s2"> And we have accumulated ideas from history</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.500" end="01:01:41.475" style="s2"> This is the best thing we can do</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.625" end="01:01:44.175" style="s2"> I know there are other religious traditions</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.025" end="01:01:46.625" style="s2"> But at the moment i don&#39;t care about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.675" end="01:01:49.125" style="s2"> Because we can use it as an example</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.625" end="01:01:51.350" style="s2"> This is the best result we can achieve</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.550" end="01:01:53.000" style="s2"> I hope everyone can</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.300" end="01:01:56.050" style="s2"> Review these stories with an open mind</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.075" end="01:01:58.675" style="s2"> Then observe if there is something we really need</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.050" end="01:02:02.125" style="s2"> I hope to be able to do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.575" end="01:02:03.375" style="s2"> Like I said before</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.425" end="01:02:05.675" style="s2"> I will deal with it as rationally as possible</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.150" end="01:02:07.750" style="s2"> Let’s start with the following point of view</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.475" end="01:02:10.100" style="s2"> We know that there is something similar to the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.100" end="01:02:12.450" style="s2"> We act in it like animals</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.875" end="01:02:14.800" style="s2"> They just act without thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.000" end="01:02:18.350" style="s2"> They don’t imagine that we start here just by acting</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.375" end="01:02:19.800" style="s2"> We start with action</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.325" end="01:02:22.775" style="s2"> And then began to be able to express our behavior</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.550" end="01:02:26.675" style="s2"> Then tell in words how we behave</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.925" end="01:02:28.750" style="s2"> This gives us the ability to tell stories</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.775" end="01:02:30.600" style="s2"> Because this is the meaning of the story</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.025" end="01:02:34.525" style="s2"> Tell how we behave</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.175" end="01:02:38.025" style="s2"> You know this because what happens when you read</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.450" end="01:02:40.725" style="s2"> The image will come to mind when you read</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.000" end="01:02:43.500" style="s2"> The characters in the book are moving in the form of images</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.975" end="01:02:46.100" style="s2"> This is one step away from putting it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.500" end="01:02:48.450" style="s2"> You don’t do it because you can abstract it</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.475" end="01:02:51.450" style="s2"> You can behave without taking action</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.950" end="01:02:52.800" style="s2"> This is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.800" end="01:02:54.975" style="s2"> Partly due to the development of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.275" end="01:02:57.525" style="s2"> This is the part of human abstract thinking ability</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.375" end="01:03:02.725" style="s2"> You can extract the performance of the behavior from the behavior</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.000" end="01:03:06.325" style="s2"> And control it before putting it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.500" end="01:03:08.750" style="s2"> That&#39;s why you can think</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.750" end="01:03:11.275" style="s2"> Then can summarize the behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.350" end="01:03:14.625" style="s2"> You can experiment in a fictional world before you practice</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.675" end="01:03:16.050" style="s2"> Not to die out of stupidity</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.275" end="01:03:20.399" style="s2"> You can let this abstraction express death instead of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.700" end="01:03:21.700" style="s2"> This is why you think</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.100" end="01:03:24.750" style="s2"> It is also part of the purpose we want to achieve through the story</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:29.175" style="s2"> What do i want to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:33.600" style="s2"> I want to end this 12-session lecture series</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.600" end="01:03:35.575" style="s2"> I know more than when I started</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.300" end="01:03:38.100" style="s2"> This is my goal because I have already said</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.750" end="01:03:40.325" style="s2"> I&#39;m not instilling you what I know</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.700" end="01:03:42.275" style="s2"> I just want to try to figure out some things</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.775" end="01:03:48.225" style="s2"> What I am doing is completing part of the process</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.225" end="01:03:49.900" style="s2"> So I started from my perspective</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.900" end="01:03:51.150" style="s2"> Do my best to do this</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.875" end="01:03:54.200" style="s2"> I came prepared but I want to work hard to stay in</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.200" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2"> The edge of my ability is here I just can sum up knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.700" end="01:04:01.275" style="s2"> Keep making it clear and investigating</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.600" end="01:04:03.200" style="s2"> I hope this is what I am</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.650" end="01:04:04.925" style="s2"> This is what I want to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.250" end="01:04:07.125" style="s2"> It seems that there are still people interested in it</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.125" end="01:04:09.975" style="s2"> Let&#39;s achieve this goal together</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.025" end="01:04:12.150" style="s2"> I planned so</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.650" end="01:04:13.625" style="s2"> The intention is</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.625" end="01:04:17.425" style="s2"> Discover something in the foundation of this strange civilization</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.425" end="01:04:18.900" style="s2"> This civilization was successfully built by our efforts</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.400" end="01:04:25.023" style="s2"> But in my opinion it’s already at stake for more than one reason</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.400" end="01:04:29.325" style="s2"> Maybe we don’t know it so easily</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.325" end="01:04:33.025" style="s2"> Throw it all away, I think this is a huge mistake</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.725" end="01:04:36.350" style="s2"> And it was abandoned because of resentment, hatred, resentment</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.350" end="01:04:39.050" style="s2"> Ignorance of history and jealousy of others</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.250" end="01:04:42.275" style="s2"> The desire for destruction and so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.125" end="01:04:44.200" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to fall into that situation</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.150" end="01:04:46.650" style="s2"> That&#39;s really not a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.050" end="01:04:48.475" style="s2"> We need to be more down to earth</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.625" end="01:04:53.300" style="s2"> I wish, let&#39;s take one step at a time</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.350" end="01:04:56.075" style="s2"> Ok so how do i proceed to do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.825" end="01:05:00.000" style="s2"> First I will look at this issue from the perspective of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.600" end="01:05:04.750" style="s2"> As far as I know, the universe has been 15 billion years since its birth</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.750" end="01:05:07.100" style="s2"> The earth is 4.5 billion years old</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.450" end="01:05:09.825" style="s2"> Life was born 3.5 billion years ago</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.100" end="01:05:13.675" style="s2"> A creature with a well-developed nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.125" end="01:05:16.450" style="s2"> Have existed for 300 to 600 million years</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.775" end="01:05:19.600" style="s2"> 60 million years ago</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.600" end="01:05:21.250" style="s2"> We are still small mammals living in trees</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.850" end="01:05:23.375" style="s2"> 60 million to 7 million years ago</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.375" end="01:05:25.850" style="s2"> We came up and down the tree to live on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.850" end="01:05:28.050" style="s2"> At this moment we separated from the chimps</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.050" end="01:05:31.825" style="s2"> The emergence of modern humans was about 150,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.175" end="01:05:35.275" style="s2"> Civilization was also born after the last ice age</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.375" end="01:05:37.450" style="s2"> It was about 15,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.450" end="01:05:39.175" style="s2"> Not particularly long</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.025" end="01:05:47.025" style="s2"> This time period is the part I want to study</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.025" end="01:05:50.300" style="s2"> I want to know why we are what we are now</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.300" end="01:05:53.225" style="s2"> Need from the origin of life itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.225" end="01:05:55.150" style="s2"> Start to observe the continuing complexity of life</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.800" end="01:05:57.025" style="s2"> Which must have real utility</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.050" end="01:05:59.250" style="s2"> Because we share some characteristics with other animals</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.300" end="01:06:04.125" style="s2"> Even simple animals like crustaceans</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.450" end="01:06:05.925" style="s2"> Crustacean nervous system and</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.925" end="01:06:07.150" style="s2"> Our nervous system has many similarities</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:09.550" style="s2"> This is worth understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.125" end="01:06:12.025" style="s2"> I think from the perspective of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.025" end="01:06:13.400" style="s2"> I think this is a matter of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.400" end="01:06:15.150" style="s2"> Very grand and extraordinary angle</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.200" end="01:06:17.725" style="s2"> Because the time span is incredible</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.425" end="01:06:19.500" style="s2"> This is really amazing</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.500" end="01:06:22.775" style="s2"> Think about living at the end of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.275" end="01:06:24.975" style="s2"> And the people in the mid-19th century</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.825" end="01:06:28.975" style="s2"> I really think this world is only about 6,000 years old</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.650" end="01:06:31.800" style="s2"> 15 billion years of history is much longer than this</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.825" end="01:06:33.875" style="s2"> This is more magnificent</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:36.825" style="s2"> But in a way it’s more terrifying and alienated</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.950" end="01:06:40.275" style="s2"> Because the universe has become so vast</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.275" end="01:06:44.175" style="s2"> It’s easy for humans to see themselves as trivial beings</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.175" end="01:06:50.700" style="s2"> Sojourn in a dark corner of the Milky Way</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.700" end="01:06:52.475" style="s2"> Among hundreds of millions of galaxies</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.500" end="01:06:55.000" style="s2"> In this time span</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.000" end="01:06:56.675" style="s2"> You can easily think of yourself as trivial</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.850" end="01:06:58.250" style="s2"> This is a real challenge for people</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.375" end="01:07:01.725" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.875" end="01:07:04.175" style="s2"> Because I feel conscious</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.175" end="01:07:05.650" style="s2"> Far more limited than what we thought</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.075" end="01:07:07.675" style="s2"> This is still something we have to solve</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.675" end="01:07:11.250" style="s2"> My way of thinking is psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:14.600" style="s2"> It means i believe</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.600" end="01:07:16.750" style="s2"> People are a collection of sub-personality</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.750" end="01:07:20.675" style="s2"> And these sub-personality are alive and not a machine</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.050" end="01:07:25.550" style="s2"> They have their own opinions, desires and perceptions</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.550" end="01:07:28.150" style="s2"> They also have their own arguments and emotions</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.475" end="01:07:31.575" style="s2"> They are like your low-resolution representations</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.575" end="01:07:32.625" style="s2"> When you are angry</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.625" end="01:07:35.600" style="s2"> It will look a lot like your very low resolution form of expression</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.725" end="01:07:38.450" style="s2"> It just wants to eat angry</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.450" end="01:07:41.350" style="s2"> Drinking or having sex</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.350" end="01:07:43.025" style="s2"> It&#39;s yourself</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.025" end="01:07:45.825" style="s2"> But it was reduced and concentrated in a specific direction</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.475" end="01:07:49.325" style="s2"> All these incentive systems</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.375" end="01:07:53.225" style="s2"> Are very old and powerful</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.500" end="01:07:57.575" style="s2"> They play a decisive role when we express ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.950" end="01:07:59.950" style="s2"> As Freud pointed out with the concept of &quot;self&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.950" end="01:08:00.825" style="s2"> We must figure out</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.825" end="01:08:03.325" style="s2"> How do we get these potential</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.325" end="01:08:04.900" style="s2"> Animalistic motives and emotions</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.900" end="01:08:07.800" style="s2"> And how to civilize it</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.825" end="01:08:11.150" style="s2"> In order to coexist on the same territory</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.150" end="01:08:13.375" style="s2"> Instead of tearing each other to pieces</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.375" end="01:08:15.675" style="s2"> And the latter is probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.675" end="01:08:17.800" style="s2"> Default settings for chimpanzees and humans</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.825" end="01:08:21.950" style="s2"> So I really value this point of view</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.950" end="01:08:23.850" style="s2"> That is the loose collection of we are all spirits</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.400" end="01:08:27.775" style="s2"> There is a place in the Old Testament that says</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.775" end="01:08:30.475" style="s2"> The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.750" end="01:08:32.100" style="s2"> I think the meaning of this sentence is similar to the above point of view</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.100" end="01:08:33.200" style="s2"> That is do you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.200" end="01:08:35.575" style="s2"> You can&#39;t completely control yourself</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.900" end="01:08:38.275" style="s2"> There are other factors behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.550" end="01:08:39.900" style="s2"> As the ancient Greeks thought</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.900" end="01:08:43.075" style="s2"> They think humans are the playthings of the gods</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.425" end="01:08:45.200" style="s2"> This is how they conceive the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.450" end="01:08:46.850" style="s2"> What they say is almost the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.850" end="01:08:48.975" style="s2"> They think that existence is not endogenous to us</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.975" end="01:08:52.325" style="s2"> Power is driving us</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.525" end="01:08:55.350" style="s2"> In a way this is the force we are obeying</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.500" end="01:08:56.300" style="s2"> But not completely obey</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.300" end="01:08:57.900" style="s2"> But you can obey them</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.925" end="01:08:59.050" style="s2"> And they are controlling our destiny</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.500" end="01:09:00.700" style="s2"> This is the view of the ancient Greeks</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.075" end="01:09:05.375" style="s2"> It will make you humble so that you can understand it</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.375" end="01:09:08.812" style="s2"> Because so much is happening behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.850" end="01:09:11.425" style="s2"> You are driving a very complicated car</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.450" end="01:09:13.575" style="s2"> But you don’t know much about this car</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.850" end="01:09:16.650" style="s2"> It has its own motivation and methodology</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.875" end="01:09:18.750" style="s2"> Sometimes you think it’s something</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.825" end="01:09:21.100" style="s2"> But in fact it is quite different</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:23.225" style="s2"> This phenomenon is very common in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.225" end="01:09:26.775" style="s2"> Because the psychiatrist is helping others to solve</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.775" end="01:09:28.225" style="s2"> Of the behavior pattern it has always shown</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.875" end="01:09:30.900" style="s2"> First they will describe the symptoms and realize the symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.100" end="01:09:33.125" style="s2"> Then they may start to explore the cause</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.125" end="01:09:35.275" style="s2"> They don’t know why they did that</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.450" end="01:09:37.200" style="s2"> At first they must have</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.450" end="01:09:40.725" style="s2"> Memory that leads to this behavior pattern</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.725" end="01:09:43.025" style="s2"> This pattern must be recalled</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.025" end="01:09:45.050" style="s2"> Perform analysis and evaluation</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.075" end="01:09:47.350" style="s2"> Then patients must consider another way of behavior</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.825" end="01:09:49.175" style="s2"> It&#39;s really complicated</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.025" end="01:09:53.850" style="s2"> Let&#39;s talk about the literary perspective after the psychoanalytic perspective</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.575" end="01:10:03.575" style="s2"> There is still a postmodernist concept of literature today</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.125" end="01:10:05.825" style="s2"> Of course there is this view of the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.125" end="01:10:09.525" style="s2"> If you interpret a complex literary work</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.525" end="01:10:11.250" style="s2"> Such as the works of Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.775" end="01:10:14.750" style="s2"> You can interpret it in countless ways</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.525" end="01:10:20.500" style="s2"> You can read it word by word and sentence by paragraph</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.500" end="01:10:22.225" style="s2"> You can also interpret the whole work</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.325" end="01:10:25.400" style="s2"> The way you interpret it depends on how many books you have read before</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.700" end="01:10:28.300" style="s2"> Also depends on your worldview</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.050" end="01:10:31.525" style="s2"> It depends on many many things</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.650" end="01:10:34.900" style="s2"> How educated you are or how uneducated you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.150" end="01:10:36.050" style="s2"> Countless things like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.350" end="01:10:40.750" style="s2"> This creates infinite possibilities for potential interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.025" end="01:10:43.300" style="s2"> The postmodernists are a little bit arrogant here</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.450" end="01:10:49.250" style="s2"> If there are countless ways to interpret a literary work</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.425" end="01:10:51.350" style="s2"> How can you be sure of any of these interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.375" end="01:10:53.400" style="s2"> Would be more reasonable than other interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.900" end="01:10:54.700" style="s2"> If you are not sure about this</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.700" end="01:10:56.750" style="s2"> How can you know which works are great</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.175" end="01:11:00.675" style="s2"> How would you know that these works are not in power</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.675" end="01:11:05.350" style="s2"> Tools to sustain its rule</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.475" end="01:11:10.150" style="s2"> This is a very typical postmodernist view and very cynical</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.425" end="01:11:11.400" style="s2"> It has its truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.450" end="01:11:13.425" style="s2"> But the point is to be based on some real things</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.250" end="01:11:15.925" style="s2"> Yes you can read things endlessly</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.250" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2"> I want to show you something briefly</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.300" end="01:11:20.200" style="s2"> We will talk back later</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.400" end="01:11:20.950" style="s2"> have a look</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.175" end="01:11:23.525" style="s2"> This is the best thing I have ever seen</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.000" end="01:11:28.850" style="s2"> Each line at the bottom represents a verse</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.050" end="01:11:35.175" style="s2"> The length of the line and this verse</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.175" end="01:11:38.475" style="s2"> The number of times it is quoted in other scriptures is proportional</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.700" end="01:11:44.350" style="s2"> So this is the first hyperlinked book</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.825" end="01:11:47.475" style="s2"> I&#39;m really serious about this</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.725" end="01:11:50.075" style="s2"> Obviously you cannot activate the hyperlink with a mouse click</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.100" end="01:11:51.900" style="s2"> But this is a book of hyperlinks through and through</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.975" end="01:11:54.425" style="s2"> This is because the people who created these stories</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.425" end="01:11:56.100" style="s2"> Assuming these stories are the end</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.500" end="01:11:59.050" style="s2"> In fact, it means the end cannot affect the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.050" end="01:12:00.825" style="s2"> This is the rule of time</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.175" end="01:12:04.175" style="s2"> What happens now will not affect what happened ten years ago</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.625" end="01:12:06.950" style="s2"> Although it is actually possible, no matter what</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.875" end="01:12:10.350" style="s2"> You can reinterpret the past and they will change</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.600" end="01:12:12.050" style="s2"> Anyway, let&#39;s not talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.500" end="01:12:15.950" style="s2"> Technically speaking, the present cannot affect the past</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.000" end="01:12:19.325" style="s2"> But this is not the case for a literary work</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.325" end="01:12:22.075" style="s2"> Because when you write to the end, you know what the beginning is like</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.075" end="01:12:24.075" style="s2"> When you write the beginning or modify the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.075" end="01:12:25.325" style="s2"> You also know what the ending is like</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.575" end="01:12:27.675" style="s2"> Then you can weave the whole story</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.125" end="01:12:30.425" style="s2"> It can be seen from this picture</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.475" end="01:12:32.100" style="s2"> A total of 65,000 cross references</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.750" end="01:12:35.300" style="s2"> For this book, this is a really amazing visual presentation</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.375" end="01:12:37.350" style="s2"> Why it is so profound</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.350" end="01:12:38.450" style="s2"> Why is this book so profound</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.750" end="01:12:39.450" style="s2"> Let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.450" end="01:12:41.450" style="s2"> How many ways can you take in these hyperlinks</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.425" end="01:12:45.375" style="s2"> This can be said to be a journey that never ends</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.400" end="01:12:46.800" style="s2"> You will never reach the end</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.550" end="01:12:49.100" style="s2"> Among them are permutation and combination</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.175" end="01:12:51.825" style="s2"> Every word depends on other words</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.900" end="01:12:53.750" style="s2"> Every sentence depends on other sentences</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.800" end="01:12:54.525" style="s2"> Of course not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.525" end="01:12:57.425" style="s2"> But 65,000 is not a small number anymore</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.100" end="01:13:05.863" style="s2"> This seems to make</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.925" end="01:13:08.375" style="s2"> Postmodernist comments are more correct</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.375" end="01:13:09.825" style="s2"> What do you know from such works</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.900" end="01:13:12.625" style="s2"> How can we sum up an authoritative explanation?</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.075" end="01:13:14.300" style="s2"> Seems impossible</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.575" end="01:13:17.250" style="s2"> But there is a problem in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.175" end="01:13:20.550" style="s2"> That is what postmodernists have</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.550" end="01:13:21.650" style="s2"> Apply this view to the whole world</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.675" end="01:13:23.825" style="s2"> They will say look at this text is too complicated</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.825" end="01:13:26.300" style="s2"> You can&#39;t come up with an authoritative explanation</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.600" end="01:13:27.775" style="s2"> What about the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.300" end="01:13:30.275" style="s2"> The world is much more complicated than a text</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.300" end="01:13:32.200" style="s2"> You can infinite ways</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.250" end="01:13:33.775" style="s2"> Observe the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.800" end="01:13:35.550" style="s2"> Then how do we know a way</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.550" end="01:13:36.875" style="s2"> Would be better than the other</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.325" end="01:13:38.550" style="s2"> This is a good question</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.700" end="01:13:42.650" style="s2"> The postmodernist answer is that we have no way of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.450" end="01:13:44.725" style="s2"> This answer is not very good</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.750" end="01:13:47.575" style="s2"> Because you will fall into chaos in this situation</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.000" end="01:13:49.375" style="s2"> You can&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.600" end="01:13:50.825" style="s2"> This is not a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.650" end="01:13:55.975" style="s2"> Because knowing nothing about things is not a neutral and harmless event</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.025" end="01:14:00.375" style="s2"> It can cause anxiety and depression</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.375" end="01:14:03.375" style="s2"> If things are so chaotic that you can&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.625" end="01:14:06.625" style="s2"> Your body will return to the default critical alert mode</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.850" end="01:14:09.800" style="s2"> Increased heart rate and immune system stops functioning</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.800" end="01:14:11.350" style="s2"> You will run out of oil</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.375" end="01:14:12.500" style="s2"> You will age very fast</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.675" end="01:14:15.800" style="s2"> Because everything around is beyond your control</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.050" end="01:14:18.025" style="s2"> This is the existential crisis</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.175" end="01:14:21.725" style="s2"> It makes people feel anxious and depressed</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.975" end="01:14:24.250" style="s2"> Not only that we found</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.250" end="01:14:26.900" style="s2"> Our nerve structure is like this</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.900" end="01:14:29.325" style="s2"> If we don’t set a goal and move towards it</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.750" end="01:14:35.000" style="s2"> We will not experience any positive emotions</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.575" end="01:14:39.575" style="s2"> It’s not that reaching the goal makes us happy</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.500" end="01:14:42.350" style="s2"> If you have achieved something, you will know</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.050" end="01:14:43.900" style="s2"> When you reach your goal</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.200" end="01:14:45.700" style="s2"> This little game is over</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.075" end="01:14:47.525" style="s2"> You need to invest in another game</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.900" end="01:14:50.750" style="s2"> So this is what Sisyphus’s god punished</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.750" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2"> But it does show</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:54.775" style="s2"> Reaching the goal does not become the motivation to drive you</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.775" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2"> Because it will crash the whole game</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.775" end="01:14:58.625" style="s2"> That&#39;s it when you graduated from university</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.625" end="01:15:01.425" style="s2"> It&#39;s like you were the king of the mountain the first day</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.575" end="01:15:05.975" style="s2"> Then you will be working at Starbucks for five years</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.700" end="01:15:11.875" style="s2"> Humans are really strange creatures</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.900" end="01:15:15.650" style="s2"> We have goals</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.650" end="01:15:17.900" style="s2"> And will be more energetic when advancing towards it than when reaching the goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.900" end="01:15:20.100" style="s2"> The meaning is that you must have a goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.425" end="01:15:22.550" style="s2"> Is that you must have an explanation</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.550" end="01:15:25.125" style="s2"> It also means that the more lofty your goal</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.125" end="01:15:27.900" style="s2"> This is a way to think about it, the better your life will be</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.525" end="01:15:31.700" style="s2"> The funny thing is that you&#39;ve heard this</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.725" end="01:15:32.575" style="s2"> Even when you were very young</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.575" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2"> Others tell you to be a good person</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.500" end="01:15:36.875" style="s2"> For example, don&#39;t lie and then you will think</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.200" end="01:15:40.851" style="s2"> Why should i be a good person why not lie</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.100" end="01:15:43.550" style="s2"> Even a three-year-old will ask that</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.575" end="01:15:46.250" style="s2"> By the way, smart kids will learn to lie earlier</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.700" end="01:15:50.925" style="s2"> They wonder why they don’t distort the structure of the facts</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.275" end="01:15:54.250" style="s2"> In order to meet my specific short-term needs</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.275" end="01:15:56.425" style="s2"> This is a great question why not</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.650" end="01:15:57.675" style="s2"> Since you can escape punishment</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.700" end="01:15:59.125" style="s2"> Why do you have to follow ethics?</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.450" end="01:16:01.700" style="s2"> Besides, this can be one step closer to what you want</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.725" end="01:16:03.375" style="s2"> Why not do this</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.650" end="01:16:04.825" style="s2"> Really a good question</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.825" end="01:16:06.275" style="s2"> But it is not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.250" end="01:16:09.750" style="s2"> This seems to be closely related to what I said before</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.400" end="01:16:11.750" style="s2"> If you make yourself unstable</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.750" end="01:16:14.000" style="s2"> Things will become messy, which is very problematic</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.175" end="01:16:16.050" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t have a lofty goal</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.200" end="01:16:21.300" style="s2"> What you have is just a trivial pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.800" end="01:16:23.700" style="s2"> And these pleasures can’t keep you</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.050" end="01:16:26.775" style="s2"> This is not good because life is really hard</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.975" end="01:16:29.700" style="s2"> Filled with too much suffering and complexity</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.025" end="01:16:32.725" style="s2"> When it&#39;s over, everyone dies. It&#39;s painful</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.075" end="01:16:34.625" style="s2"> Without a lofty goal</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.625" end="01:16:36.300" style="s2"> What do you use to resist these</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.875" end="01:16:38.400" style="s2"> You can&#39;t help you despair</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.400" end="01:16:42.950" style="s2"> When you despair</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.075" end="01:16:44.400" style="s2"> Things will deteriorate quite quickly</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.450" end="01:16:46.575" style="s2"> So there is the concept of lofty goals</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.150" end="01:16:49.850" style="s2"> It is necessary</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.350" end="01:16:52.525" style="s2"> This is the food necessary for people to survive</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.525" end="01:16:54.150" style="s2"> This is not some mysterious food</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.250" end="01:16:55.350" style="s2"> It is the lofty goal</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.675" end="01:16:56.650" style="s2"> And what is the lofty goal?</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.275" end="01:16:59.625" style="s2"> Part of it has been concentrated in</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.650" end="01:17:00.700" style="s2"> Marduk&#39;s story is in</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.850" end="01:17:05.675" style="s2"> That is to always focus on speaking appropriately and face the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.075" end="01:17:07.325" style="s2"> Build a better world</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.475" end="01:17:08.475" style="s2"> It&#39;s something like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.025" end="01:17:10.450" style="s2"> This is the lofty goal</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.450" end="01:17:11.700" style="s2"> It will make you stand upright</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.100" end="01:17:16.025" style="s2"> Instead of shrinking into a ball and thinking about your own existence</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.025" end="01:17:18.100" style="s2"> So you can do something worth the time</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.100" end="01:17:20.400" style="s2"> Just to give you on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.400" end="01:17:21.650" style="s2"> A miserable situation</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.575" end="01:17:24.500" style="s2"> From the perspective of literature</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.500" end="01:17:30.650" style="s2"> You can explain a text from many angles</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.675" end="01:17:31.825" style="s2"> But this is not right</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.825" end="01:17:34.200" style="s2"> This is where the postmodernists go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.375" end="01:17:37.200" style="s2"> What you are looking for in a text</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.200" end="01:17:38.375" style="s2"> The same principle is to be pursued in the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.475" end="01:17:41.100" style="s2"> Is enough order and direction</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.025" end="01:17:42.750" style="s2"> We have to consider</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.825" end="01:17:45.375" style="s2"> What does adequate order and direction mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.625" end="01:17:47.525" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want to suffer too much</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.525" end="01:17:49.025" style="s2"> So that your life becomes unbearable</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.775" end="01:17:51.125" style="s2"> This seems pretty self-explanatory</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.550" end="01:17:54.025" style="s2"> Pain is to justify yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.825" end="01:17:56.900" style="s2"> I think pain is the fundamental reality</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.925" end="01:17:58.400" style="s2"> Because no one will argue about it</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.400" end="01:18:02.075" style="s2"> Even if you say you don’t believe in pain</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.075" end="01:18:04.325" style="s2"> Won&#39;t make you feel better when you suffer</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.325" end="01:18:05.725" style="s2"> You still believe</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.150" end="01:18:10.775" style="s2"> You cannot eradicate it with logic and reason</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.175" end="01:18:14.225" style="s2"> It exists fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.300" end="01:18:16.300" style="s2"> And it’s actually very useful to recognize this</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.550" end="01:18:18.025" style="s2"> That is you don’t want to suffer more</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.025" end="01:18:19.500" style="s2"> Unless it is absolutely necessary</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.875" end="01:18:21.550" style="s2"> I think it goes without saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.600" end="01:18:23.050" style="s2"> But you might say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.050" end="01:18:24.075" style="s2"> The problem is not so simple</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.975" end="01:18:27.325" style="s2"> Not only do you not want to suffer more than necessary today</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.750" end="01:18:29.650" style="s2"> And tomorrow next week</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.650" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2"> Next month and next year</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:33.450" style="s2"> So no matter what you do now</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2"> It&#39;s best not to endanger yourself in a year</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.150" end="01:18:38.700" style="s2"> Because it will backfire</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.875" end="01:18:40.925" style="s2"> This is the problem of short-term pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.650" end="01:18:44.375" style="s2"> I regret a lot of hastily</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.400" end="01:18:46.275" style="s2"> Everyone understands this truth</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.825" end="01:18:48.525" style="s2"> What you do will work right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.525" end="01:18:51.275" style="s2"> To be sustainable tomorrow, next week, next month and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.675" end="01:18:54.025" style="s2"> So you have to think about the future</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.500" end="01:18:56.000" style="s2"> Humans can do this</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.250" end="01:18:58.075" style="s2"> Consider your future</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.075" end="01:19:00.950" style="s2"> This is not much different from taking care of others</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.500" end="01:19:04.925" style="s2"> I remember there was an episode in The Simpsons</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.550" end="01:19:09.900" style="s2"> Homer drank a quart of mayonnaise and vodka</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.000" end="01:19:18.275" style="s2"> Marge said that you shouldn&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.275" end="01:19:20.525" style="s2"> Then Homer answered that it was the future Homer’s question.</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.775" end="01:19:23.350" style="s2"> Fortunately I am not that person</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.250" end="01:19:30.025" style="s2"> It&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.500" end="01:19:33.900" style="s2"> But we need to work hard to overcome this</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.900" end="01:19:35.750" style="s2"> Future you</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.825" end="01:19:37.400" style="s2"> Is a bit like another person</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.775" end="01:19:40.600" style="s2"> And handle you properly</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.625" end="01:19:42.050" style="s2"> Relationship with the future self</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.100" end="01:19:45.250" style="s2"> And figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.275" end="01:19:46.750" style="s2"> No different from other people</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.075" end="01:19:48.875" style="s2"> So we can relieve the constraints</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.600" end="01:19:51.650" style="s2"> The explanation you extracted</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.675" end="01:19:53.775" style="s2"> Not only protect you</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.800" end="01:19:55.425" style="s2"> Free from pain and give you a goal</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.675" end="01:19:57.600" style="s2"> And it must be done in an iterable way</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.500" end="01:19:59.850" style="s2"> So it can continue over time</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.175" end="01:20:02.625" style="s2"> And this process also requires the participation of others</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.950" end="01:20:04.500" style="s2"> So you can work with them</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.500" end="01:20:05.975" style="s2"> In a way that reduces your own pain</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.975" end="01:20:07.550" style="s2"> Do something with them</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.175" end="01:20:10.900" style="s2"> People are not so forgiving</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.325" end="01:20:13.225" style="s2"> They have a choice</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.250" end="01:20:14.675" style="s2"> They don’t have to deal with you</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.675" end="01:20:16.300" style="s2"> They can also deal with other primates</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.075" end="01:20:18.550" style="s2"> If you behave inappropriately</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.550" end="01:20:22.950" style="s2"> At least if you cross certain boundaries then you will be left out</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.350" end="01:20:26.475" style="s2"> People are spreading information to you all the time</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.475" end="01:20:28.375" style="s2"> About how you need to interpret the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.675" end="01:20:30.475" style="s2"> So they can tolerate you when they are by your side</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.750" end="01:20:33.100" style="s2"> And you also need this because if you are isolated from the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.100" end="01:20:34.550" style="s2"> You will be insane until death</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.900" end="01:20:37.875" style="s2"> No one can stand long loneliness</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.300" end="01:20:40.375" style="s2"> Without constant feedback from others</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.425" end="01:20:43.125" style="s2"> We can&#39;t stay sane</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.125" end="01:20:44.125" style="s2"> This is simply too complicated</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.025" end="01:20:47.025" style="s2"> You are bound by your existence</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.025" end="01:20:49.525" style="s2"> You will also be bound by the existence of others</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.975" end="01:20:51.850" style="s2"> At the same time the world is restricting you</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.000" end="01:20:56.175" style="s2"> I read this point from &quot;Hamlet&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.175" end="01:20:57.750" style="s2"> That&#39;s i should jump off the bridge</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.750" end="01:21:02.825" style="s2"> So that my explanation can end soon</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.825" end="01:21:06.450" style="s2"> This doesn&#39;t seem to work very well</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.925" end="01:21:11.450" style="s2"> An explanation is constrained by the reality of the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.450" end="01:21:13.450" style="s2"> It is also bound by the reality of others</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.725" end="01:21:16.375" style="s2"> Your reality restricts it over time</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.775" end="01:21:19.175" style="s2"> In a tightly defined space</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.450" end="01:21:22.500" style="s2"> Only a few explanations make sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.075" end="01:21:26.475" style="s2"> This is part of the reason why postmodernists went wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.000" end="01:21:29.850" style="s2"> This is also how people work hard to create artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.850" end="01:21:31.075" style="s2"> When making smart machines</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.075" end="01:21:32.700" style="s2"> Part of the reason why it must be limited to one entity</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.450" end="01:21:35.825" style="s2"> From this we can see that if we don’t materialize it</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.825" end="01:21:37.725" style="s2"> You can&#39;t make any smart machines</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.875" end="01:21:40.250" style="s2"> This is part of the reason I just described</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.600" end="01:21:42.950" style="s2"> You need to constrain the system</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.600" end="01:21:48.175" style="s2"> Otherwise the entire system will be submerged</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.175" end="01:21:50.225" style="s2"> In the ocean of infinite interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.625" end="01:21:51.575" style="s2"> Almost like this</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.125" end="01:21:54.100" style="s2"> This is its literary aspect</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.100" end="01:21:55.150" style="s2"> Moral aspect</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.475" end="01:21:58.292" style="s2"> Ethics is only related to behavior to me</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.350" end="01:22:00.575" style="s2"> To some extent I am an existentialist</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.575" end="01:22:03.000" style="s2"> That means I firmly believe</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.000" end="01:22:04.725" style="s2"> What people believe in truth</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.725" end="01:22:06.975" style="s2"> It&#39;s the behavior, not the words</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.950" end="01:22:09.750" style="s2"> There are many definitions of truth</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.150" end="01:22:11.775" style="s2"> Truth is a very broad word</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.825" end="01:22:13.225" style="s2"> You can think of objective truth</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.700" end="01:22:17.200" style="s2"> But behavioral truth and objective truth are consistent</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.450" end="01:22:21.750" style="s2"> As far as I know, what you should do is not the same as the facts</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.750" end="01:22:22.650" style="s2"> People are divided on this</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.650" end="01:22:26.250" style="s2"> But I think the reason should be the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.825" end="01:22:29.800" style="s2"> Think of it this way, you stand in front of a wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.625" end="01:22:31.950" style="s2"> You can see the wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.625" end="01:22:34.700" style="s2"> But the wilderness won’t tell you how to pass it</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.150" end="01:22:37.825" style="s2"> You can walk through it in countless ways</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.350" end="01:22:40.225" style="s2"> So you can&#39;t extract</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.750" end="01:22:42.706" style="s2"> An inviolable guide to guide you</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.725" end="01:22:45.500" style="s2"> How to act in front of all kinds of facts</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.850" end="01:22:49.450" style="s2"> There are so many facts that you will lose direction</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.700" end="01:22:53.175" style="s2"> But you need to know how to avoid pain</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.200" end="01:22:55.425" style="s2"> Need to know what your goal is</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.800" end="01:22:56.950" style="s2"> So you need to use some explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.950" end="01:23:00.275" style="s2"> To superimpose on objective reality</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.850" end="01:23:02.525" style="s2"> This is what we want to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.525" end="01:23:04.325" style="s2"> The essence of explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.700" end="01:23:06.375" style="s2"> I have given a hint before</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.725" end="01:23:09.350" style="s2"> We have taken it from the observation of our own behavior</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.350" end="01:23:10.725" style="s2"> Extracted from observations of others</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.300" end="01:23:12.600" style="s2"> The part we extract is</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.650" end="01:23:14.450" style="s2"> With our concretized nature</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.475" end="01:23:17.350" style="s2"> This is formed in the past billions of years</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.950" end="01:23:20.425" style="s2"> We see the infinite plane of fact</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.425" end="01:23:23.525" style="s2"> Then we imposed a moral explanation on it</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.525" end="01:23:27.325" style="s2"> Moral explanation is how to act on objective existence</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.050" end="01:23:30.550" style="s2"> This is related to the sense of security</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.025" end="01:23:32.950" style="s2"> Because you just don&#39;t want to make things too complicated</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.050" end="01:23:34.075" style="s2"> And this is also related to the goal</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.450" end="01:23:35.700" style="s2"> We are moving creatures</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.725" end="01:23:38.050" style="s2"> We need to know where to go</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.850" end="01:23:41.475" style="s2"> In general everything we care about</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.550" end="01:23:42.625" style="s2"> Where is the future</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.150" end="01:23:44.325" style="s2"> This is what we need to know</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.475" end="01:23:46.525" style="s2"> Where are we going and what are we doing and why</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.975" end="01:23:48.625" style="s2"> This is the same as &quot;Objectively what makes the world?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.650" end="01:23:51.150" style="s2"> Are two different things</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.475" end="01:23:52.675" style="s2"> This is a completely different question</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.750" end="01:23:53.775" style="s2"> It requires a completely different answer</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.725" end="01:23:57.150" style="s2"> As far as I know this is the realm of morality</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.325" end="01:23:59.150" style="s2"> That&#39;s what your goal is</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.150" end="01:24:02.975" style="s2"> In a sense, this question is about the ultimate ideal paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.975" end="01:24:06.125" style="s2"> Although you have some trivial ideals</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.475" end="01:24:09.525" style="s2"> Something will emerge from it</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.025" end="01:24:12.475" style="s2"> More coherent and integrated</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.975" end="01:24:15.475" style="s2"> Applicable and practical things</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.925" end="01:24:17.075" style="s2"> This brings up another point</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.425" end="01:24:21.210" style="s2"> When you think of literature and art</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.210" end="01:24:23.825" style="s2"> You will think they are not very grounded</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.000" end="01:24:26.925" style="s2"> They are illusory and divine</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.250" end="01:24:28.600" style="s2"> Seems impractical</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.350" end="01:24:30.700" style="s2"> And i&#39;m a real person</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.600" end="01:24:35.550" style="s2"> I think from the perspective of literary aesthetics and evolution</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.550" end="01:24:38.200" style="s2"> Part of the reason to review these books is</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.225" end="01:24:43.500" style="s2"> I want to extract something of practical value from it</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.850" end="01:24:47.450" style="s2"> Because I have a rule when I lecture</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.975" end="01:24:51.450" style="s2"> That’s what I won’t tell others that is useless to them</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.950" end="01:24:53.750" style="s2"> I think knowledge is a tool</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.000" end="01:24:56.300" style="s2"> It is something to be implemented in this world</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.300" end="01:24:57.825" style="s2"> We are creatures that use tools</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.875" end="01:24:59.325" style="s2"> Our knowledge is the tool</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.800" end="01:25:01.450" style="s2"> We need to use tools to work in this world</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.525" end="01:25:03.275" style="s2"> We need tools to regulate our emotions</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.275" end="01:25:04.500" style="s2"> To improve things</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.875" end="01:25:07.375" style="s2"> To end the pain as much as possible</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.675" end="01:25:11.200" style="s2"> Come calmly and stand on its own feet</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.650" end="01:25:13.200" style="s2"> You need tools to do this</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.900" end="01:25:17.225" style="s2"> So in this series of lectures</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.225" end="01:25:18.225" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to do anything unrealistic</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.250" end="01:25:20.500" style="s2"> I want you to leave</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.225" end="01:25:22.400" style="s2"> Can have some systemic things</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.400" end="01:25:24.450" style="s2"> And it&#39;s something that can be used immediately</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.500" end="01:25:28.600" style="s2"> I am not interested in abstracting for the sake of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.350" end="01:25:32.625" style="s2"> It needs to be reasonable it has to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.175" end="01:25:38.950" style="s2"> Because the more restrictions on the theory, the better</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.450" end="01:25:44.725" style="s2"> I want everything to have a context</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.750" end="01:25:49.925" style="s2"> B followed by AA and B before C</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.925" end="01:25:52.075" style="s2"> This way is understandable</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.100" end="01:25:56.300" style="s2"> No unnecessary leap of faith</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.800" end="01:25:59.075" style="s2"> Dealing with us and people like the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.075" end="01:26:02.275" style="s2"> The relationship between a set of books</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.275" end="01:26:04.175" style="s2"> Another problem is that you are being asked</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.175" end="01:26:07.200" style="s2"> To believe in something other people can’t believe</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.700" end="01:26:08.600" style="s2"> That&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.600" end="01:26:10.850" style="s2"> Because it seems to me it is a form of lies</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.075" end="01:26:12.625" style="s2"> Then you have to void the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.625" end="01:26:14.825" style="s2"> Because in principle this whole thing is about truth</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.825" end="01:26:16.850" style="s2"> If you want to swallow a lot of lies</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.850" end="01:26:18.375" style="s2"> To start your pursuit of truth</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.800" end="01:26:20.775" style="s2"> How can you achieve any achievement</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.650" end="01:26:25.500" style="s2"> I don’t want to leave any uncertainty fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.550" end="01:26:26.750" style="s2"> Or I don’t want to leave any</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.750" end="01:26:29.550" style="s2"> I don&#39;t need to be left uncertain</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.775" end="01:26:31.475" style="s2"> Because then I can&#39;t go deeper</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.175" end="01:26:34.900" style="s2"> It must have a reasonable meaning</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.150" end="01:26:38.500" style="s2"> I also don&#39;t want it to work with</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.725" end="01:26:41.350" style="s2"> Known scientific facts contradict</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.350" end="01:26:42.750" style="s2"> Although science is constantly changing</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.825" end="01:26:45.775" style="s2"> That is a dangerous parameter</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.900" end="01:26:50.075" style="s2"> For example, if a solution doesn’t make sense in the theory of evolution,</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.100" end="01:26:52.350" style="s2"> Then this is not a good solution</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.325" end="01:26:57.350" style="s2"> Then there is the last point of phenomenological perspective</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.925" end="01:27:04.650" style="s2"> Modern people think reality is objective</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.875" end="01:27:07.225" style="s2"> We are very strong</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.750" end="01:27:10.125" style="s2"> But we don’t experience reality like this</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.275" end="01:27:13.250" style="s2"> We all have our experience field</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.400" end="01:27:17.700" style="s2"> But this is a very difficult thing to understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.700" end="01:27:19.400" style="s2"> Although it should be the most obvious</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.000" end="01:27:23.075" style="s2"> For phenomenologists, everything you experience is true</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.325" end="01:27:27.825" style="s2"> They are very interested in your subjective experience structure</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.475" end="01:27:31.675" style="s2"> You have your subjective experience, you also have everyone</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.850" end="01:27:34.350" style="s2"> But these experiences have something in common</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.475" end="01:27:38.825" style="s2"> For example, you will all experience the same set of emotions</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.275" end="01:27:41.675" style="s2"> We can recognize typical emotions</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.150" end="01:27:45.437" style="s2"> We can’t even communicate without the typical motivation</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.450" end="01:27:48.000" style="s2"> Because you don&#39;t know what the other person is like</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.075" end="01:27:49.875" style="s2"> In this case you have to explain endlessly</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.900" end="01:27:51.675" style="s2"> Nothing you can take for granted</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.725" end="01:27:52.375" style="s2"> But you can do</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.275" end="01:27:54.675" style="s2"> Phenomenology is</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.900" end="01:27:56.400" style="s2"> In the center of my sight and hands</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.400" end="01:27:58.250" style="s2"> Those are clear but to the edge of this range</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.250" end="01:27:59.825" style="s2"> They disappear</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.575" end="01:28:03.450" style="s2"> Phenomenology is about how things smell and taste</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.450" end="01:28:04.825" style="s2"> And their importance</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.325" end="01:28:06.800" style="s2"> Then in a sense you can also say the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.425" end="01:28:09.575" style="s2"> Phenomenology studies</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.400" end="01:28:13.250" style="s2"> The importance of matter rather than matter itself</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.250" end="01:28:16.400" style="s2"> From a phenomenological perspective</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.400" end="01:28:18.175" style="s2"> A basic fact is that everything has meaning</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.925" end="01:28:24.275" style="s2"> Even if you are a rationalist, cynicist, nihilist</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.275" end="01:28:26.100" style="s2"> Saying that everything is meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.200" end="01:28:28.650" style="s2"> You still face the problem of &quot;pain&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.325" end="01:28:32.225" style="s2"> Pain is meaningful, it weakens your argument</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.650" end="01:28:35.150" style="s2"> Meaning cannot be escaped</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.150" end="01:28:38.125" style="s2"> You can largely destroy the positive part of it</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.550" end="01:28:39.500" style="s2"> But you try hard</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.500" end="01:28:41.150" style="s2"> Can you figure it out from the negative side?</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.150" end="01:28:43.225" style="s2"> Good luck because it doesn&#39;t work at all</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.650" end="01:28:48.475" style="s2"> &quot;Bible&quot; story is about phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.475" end="01:28:52.175" style="s2"> I think all fictional works are like this</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.975" end="01:29:00.125" style="s2"> It is dedicated to clarifying the nature of human experience</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.125" end="01:29:02.350" style="s2"> This is different from the objective world</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.525" end="01:29:04.075" style="s2"> It is also a form of truth</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.400" end="01:29:07.350" style="s2"> Because your field of experience is real</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.350" end="01:29:08.650" style="s2"> Also quality</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.700" end="01:29:10.550" style="s2"> So the question is what is quality</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.475" end="01:29:14.350" style="s2"> The representation of reality in ancient times is</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.375" end="01:29:17.300" style="s2"> A strange mixture of observable phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.300" end="01:29:19.575" style="s2"> This is what we call objective facts</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.875" end="01:29:23.300" style="s2"> At that time, there was also a projection of subjective facts in the representation of reality</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.300" end="01:29:24.250" style="s2"> I will show you</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.200" end="01:29:29.575" style="s2"> How do Mesopotamians see the world</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.575" end="01:29:33.300" style="s2"> Their world model is a disc</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.675" end="01:29:35.775" style="s2"> If you walk into a clearing in the dark</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.425" end="01:29:37.300" style="s2"> What can the world look like to you</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.750" end="01:29:38.950" style="s2"> Isn&#39;t it just a disc?</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.225" end="01:29:40.825" style="s2"> There is also a dome on this disc</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.200" end="01:29:44.150" style="s2"> This is basically the worldview of the Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.150" end="01:29:45.175" style="s2"> The person who wrote the opening stories of the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.175" end="01:29:47.225" style="s2"> View the world in this way</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.525" end="01:29:50.400" style="s2"> The water on the dome is obvious</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.575" end="01:29:52.500" style="s2"> Because it always rains, right</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.525" end="01:29:53.675" style="s2"> Where does the water come from?</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.900" end="01:29:55.650" style="s2"> There is also water around the dome</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.250" end="01:29:58.125" style="s2"> The whole disc is made of land</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.175" end="01:29:59.825" style="s2"> There is water flowing under the ground</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.075" end="01:30:00.925" style="s2"> How do you know this</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.300" end="01:30:03.350" style="s2"> You can drill down to get water</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.550" end="01:30:04.725" style="s2"> This water comes down from the ground</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.000" end="01:30:06.525" style="s2"> How else can you get water</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.925" end="01:30:08.725" style="s2"> What&#39;s under this fresh water</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.800" end="01:30:10.000" style="s2"> Further down</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.125" end="01:30:11.425" style="s2"> If you go to the edge of the disc</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.425" end="01:30:13.575" style="s2"> You will see the sea and that is salt water</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.050" end="01:30:17.800" style="s2"> So this is a dome surrounded by water</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.450" end="01:30:20.900" style="s2"> The dome covers a disc</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.100" end="01:30:22.925" style="s2"> Fresh water flows under the disc</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.975" end="01:30:24.550" style="s2"> There is salt water further down</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.950" end="01:30:26.950" style="s2"> This is roughly the world in the eyes of the Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.125" end="01:30:31.850" style="s2"> It is a mixture of observation and imagination</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.375" end="01:30:34.100" style="s2"> Because this is not the real world</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.150" end="01:30:36.425" style="s2"> Just what the world shows</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.050" end="01:30:39.900" style="s2"> This is a completely credible cosmology</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.600" end="01:30:44.325" style="s2"> The sun rises and sets over the dome</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.325" end="01:30:46.200" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t look like something is going around</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.200" end="01:30:47.425" style="s2"> How could anyone think of this</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.750" end="01:30:50.125" style="s2"> Obviously the sun rises and sets</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.125" end="01:30:53.525" style="s2"> Then it moves below the world and then rises again</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.700" end="01:30:55.700" style="s2"> Nothing more obvious than this</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.300" end="01:31:00.600" style="s2"> This is on the cognitive level</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.450" end="01:31:04.875" style="s2"> The weird interweaving of subjective fantasy and visible phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.200" end="01:31:08.100" style="s2"> All related to the story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.100" end="01:31:09.825" style="s2"> The universe theory is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.900" end="01:31:14.825" style="s2"> It is semi-psychological and semi-realistic</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.225" end="01:31:17.300" style="s2"> And the psychological part is actually real</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.125" end="01:31:23.050" style="s2"> I understand that in the Bible story</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.050" end="01:31:25.975" style="s2"> Phenomenological truth is indeed worth it</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.100" end="01:31:29.350" style="s2"> Poor fundamentalists</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.350" end="01:31:32.475" style="s2"> Trying to stick to their moral structure</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.775" end="01:31:34.075" style="s2"> I can understand why</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.850" end="01:31:37.950" style="s2"> Because it really organized their society and soul</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.950" end="01:31:39.325" style="s2"> So they have to rely on</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.325" end="01:31:43.025" style="s2"> But for the complexity that constitutes truth</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.100" end="01:31:46.025" style="s2"> They don’t have a very precise concept</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.025" end="01:31:48.700" style="s2"> They tried to put the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.700" end="01:31:51.450" style="s2"> Fetched in the field of scientific theory</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.300" end="01:31:56.350" style="s2"> For example, to promote creationism</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.375" end="01:31:58.175" style="s2"> Treat it as another scientific theory</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.175" end="01:32:00.275" style="s2"> Isn&#39;t this futile</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.925" end="01:32:03.475" style="s2"> The person who wrote these stories</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.475" end="01:32:05.139" style="s2"> Not a scientist at all</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.175" end="01:32:06.950" style="s2"> There were no scientists at all</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.275" end="01:32:09.450" style="s2"> Of course not much now</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.800" end="01:32:12.550" style="s2"> It’s really hard for us to see things from a scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.575" end="01:32:14.675" style="s2"> This requires a lot of training</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.800" end="01:32:16.575" style="s2"> Outside the lab</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.575" end="01:32:18.400" style="s2"> Scientists don’t use scientific thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.800" end="01:32:20.350" style="s2"> Of course they don’t use scientific thinking very much in the laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.650" end="01:32:22.975" style="s2"> Because you have to be peer reviewed and criticized</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.200" end="01:32:24.900" style="s2"> Scientific thinking is really hard</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.675" end="01:32:27.250" style="s2"> No matter how the people who wrote these stories</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.250" end="01:32:29.625" style="s2"> The way of thinking is very similar to that of playwrights</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.625" end="01:32:30.925" style="s2"> It&#39;s like Shakespeare&#39;s way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.925" end="01:32:33.575" style="s2"> But this does not mean that there is no truth in it</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.575" end="01:32:36.125" style="s2"> It just means that in the concept of truth</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.125" end="01:32:38.650" style="s2"> You need to be more precise, this is okay</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.650" end="01:32:43.017" style="s2"> There will always be some practical truths, right?</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.025" end="01:32:44.775" style="s2"> We want to figure out what these truths are</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.850" end="01:32:45.775" style="s2"> Because we need to live</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.775" end="01:32:47.175" style="s2"> Maybe need not suffer too much</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.375" end="01:32:51.675" style="s2"> So if you know the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.675" end="01:32:53.975" style="s2"> And what other stories try to show is</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.250" end="01:32:57.600" style="s2"> Past experience of conscious individuals</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.025" end="01:33:01.425" style="s2"> The structure that the conscious individual has experienced</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.425" end="01:33:06.075" style="s2"> You may enter a completely different field of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.200" end="01:33:09.825" style="s2"> It eliminates the gap between the objective world and the religious story</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.825" end="01:33:14.125" style="s2"> Painful contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.125" end="01:33:20.175" style="s2"> Let’s take a look at the structure of this book</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.825" end="01:33:22.175" style="s2"> The first thing to mention about the Bible is</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.175" end="01:33:23.275" style="s2"> It&#39;s a comedy</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.275" end="01:33:26.025" style="s2"> Comedy has a happy ending</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.425" end="01:33:27.950" style="s2"> This is weird</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.950" end="01:33:31.225" style="s2"> Because Greek mythology is almost always tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.425" end="01:33:33.450" style="s2"> And the Bible is a comedy</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.025" end="01:33:34.950" style="s2"> Have a happy ending</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.950" end="01:33:36.750" style="s2"> Everyone is alive and there is a heaven</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.675" end="01:33:40.925" style="s2"> How do you think about it is another matter entirely</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.925" end="01:33:43.150" style="s2"> I&#39;m just telling you the structure of this story</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.150" end="01:33:45.775" style="s2"> It can be said that there is a heaven at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.725" end="01:33:49.875" style="s2"> Then there were some disasters and people fell into history since then</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.875" end="01:33:54.100" style="s2"> History is to limit death pain and self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.375" end="01:33:55.775" style="s2"> But there is a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.775" end="01:33:58.150" style="s2"> Or imply a model of nation-building</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.225" end="01:33:59.900" style="s2"> It can surpass those</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.375" end="01:34:02.150" style="s2"> This is also what time points to</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.500" end="01:34:04.950" style="s2"> This is the concept of the story</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.400" end="01:34:08.650" style="s2"> What’s interesting is that the Bible also has a story</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.650" end="01:34:10.600" style="s2"> Because it was not a book when it was written</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.600" end="01:34:13.450" style="s2"> It&#39;s a combination of many different books</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.825" end="01:34:17.450" style="s2"> These books can be combined to form a story</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.450" end="01:34:18.925" style="s2"> This is really extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.050" end="01:34:24.150" style="s2"> The question is what this story tells</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.950" end="01:34:26.575" style="s2"> How it became a story</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.575" end="01:34:28.800" style="s2"> Is there any reason</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.175" end="01:34:33.300" style="s2"> It constitutes a dramatic record of self-realization or abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.300" end="01:34:34.450" style="s2"> I mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.725" end="01:34:41.250" style="s2"> The idea of ​​formulating the image of God is an abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.275" end="01:34:42.925" style="s2"> This is how we will proceed to interpret it later</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.500" end="01:34:44.700" style="s2"> Because I said before</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.950" end="01:34:49.350" style="s2"> I will not simplify unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.900" end="01:34:54.600" style="s2"> I want to say that I know the evidence of true religious experience</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.775" end="01:34:56.050" style="s2"> Is beyond doubt</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.550" end="01:34:58.100" style="s2"> But it is also unexplainable</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.500" end="01:35:00.350" style="s2"> So i won&#39;t explain it</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.350" end="01:35:02.050" style="s2"> I want to treat it as a fact</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.475" end="01:35:03.850" style="s2"> Then I will pull out of it</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.850" end="01:35:06.725" style="s2"> For example, we first treat it as a fact and a mystery</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.225" end="01:35:11.175" style="s2"> Then we have to look at it from a rational perspective</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.175" end="01:35:13.800" style="s2"> Another example is the initial formulation of the concept of God</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.800" end="01:35:16.325" style="s2"> Is an attempt to abstract the ideal model</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.725" end="01:35:21.500" style="s2"> Then we consider it as an abstract consideration outside of realisation</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.525" end="01:35:23.275" style="s2"> That&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.350" end="01:35:25.625" style="s2"> It would be amazing if this is true</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.900" end="01:35:30.025" style="s2"> But I don’t want to kill a boat with a stick</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.850" end="01:35:34.125" style="s2"> This is a set of books launched by many editors and editors</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.200" end="01:35:35.100" style="s2"> What does this mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.350" end="01:35:36.475" style="s2"> Means that many people are involved in writing</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.175" end="01:35:38.575" style="s2"> Formed many different books</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.075" end="01:35:40.350" style="s2"> All mixed together</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.350" end="01:35:43.250" style="s2"> Especially the first five books were compiled by a specific group of people</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.275" end="01:35:50.800" style="s2"> I suspect they are under a single political organization</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.800" end="01:35:53.825" style="s2"> Integrate tribal traditions</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.900" end="01:35:56.350" style="s2"> And try to connect what they describe</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.250" end="01:36:01.200" style="s2"> They learn from each tribe’s traditions</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.300" end="01:36:03.550" style="s2"> And don’t miss any case easily</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.550" end="01:36:05.050" style="s2"> Because they seem to be precious</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.050" end="01:36:06.625" style="s2"> Looking at the people who compiled these stories</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.625" end="01:36:07.650" style="s2"> It must be precious</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.650" end="01:36:11.175" style="s2"> Because they can&#39;t tolerate excessive deletions</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.750" end="01:36:14.325" style="s2"> But they want to think it makes sense to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.325" end="01:36:19.900" style="s2"> So that the book will not be completely illogical and absurd</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.500" end="01:36:22.675" style="s2"> Many people participated in writing</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.300" end="01:36:24.550" style="s2"> Many people also participated in the editing</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.550" end="01:36:25.950" style="s2"> There are many people in a long time course</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.975" end="01:36:28.125" style="s2"> Combine it</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.925" end="01:36:30.725" style="s2"> Documents like this are very rare</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.800" end="01:36:33.225" style="s2"> And just because we have a document like this</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.700" end="01:36:36.625" style="s2"> There are enough reasons to regard it as</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.625" end="01:36:38.550" style="s2"> An extraordinary phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.550" end="01:36:39.575" style="s2"> And there are enough reasons to work hard to understand</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.750" end="01:36:42.050" style="s2"> The message it tries to convey</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.025" end="01:36:45.600" style="s2"> I said this is the world’s first hyperlinked book</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.700" end="01:36:50.150" style="s2"> This is indeed very intriguing for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.575" end="01:36:56.375" style="s2"> The Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.400" end="01:36:57.350" style="s2"> Or the Hebrew Bible has four bases</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.850" end="01:36:59.725" style="s2"> Four stories we know come together</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.950" end="01:37:02.797" style="s2"> The first is the priest document</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.225" end="01:37:06.350" style="s2"> The name of God in it is called &quot;Ilohim&quot; or &quot;Ilshade&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.775" end="01:37:10.300" style="s2"> I think &quot;Yil&quot; is also the origin of the word &quot;Allah&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.225" end="01:37:14.975" style="s2"> It is often translated as &quot;God/God&quot; or &quot;Gods&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.975" end="01:37:17.750" style="s2"> Because the word &quot;Elohim&quot; is in the first few books of the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.750" end="01:37:20.950" style="s2"> Is in the plural</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.375" end="01:37:23.975" style="s2"> This background is newer than Jehovah’s documents</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.125" end="01:37:25.775" style="s2"> The reason I say this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.775" end="01:37:28.650" style="s2"> The first chapter of Genesis is the first story</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.650" end="01:37:30.525" style="s2"> It was not created in the same period as the second chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.525" end="01:37:33.700" style="s2"> Chapter 2 contains the content of Jehovah&#39;s version</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.700" end="01:37:35.900" style="s2"> It contains the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.475" end="01:37:38.650" style="s2"> It is older than the first book in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.150" end="01:37:41.675" style="s2"> But they decided to put the new version first</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.675" end="01:37:46.400" style="s2"> I think this is because it deals with more fundamental abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.525" end="01:37:47.750" style="s2"> Reasons like this</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.750" end="01:37:50.100" style="s2"> It deals with the most basic abstract concepts</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.400" end="01:37:51.925" style="s2"> About how the universe was formed</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.200" end="01:37:55.900" style="s2"> Then it was connected to the appearance of the human environment</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.575" end="01:37:58.500" style="s2"> It seems that the logic behind it is like this</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.300" end="01:38:04.500" style="s2"> The four-character God’s name is used in the Jehovah literature</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.500" end="01:38:06.350" style="s2"> Obviously people don’t think so</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.350" end="01:38:08.325" style="s2"> But we know that its pronunciation is similar to &quot;Jehovah&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.050" end="01:38:13.225" style="s2"> This version contains an extremely anthropomorphic God</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.225" end="01:38:14.725" style="s2"> Have a human appearance</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.150" end="01:38:16.950" style="s2"> This point starts in the fourth chapter of the second chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.075" end="01:38:19.100" style="s2"> This is the description of heaven and earth</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.100" end="01:38:21.400" style="s2"> It also contains the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.400" end="01:38:22.850" style="s2"> The story of Cain and Abel The story of Noah&#39;s Ark</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.875" end="01:38:24.600" style="s2"> And the story of the Tower of Babel &quot;Exodus&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.025" end="01:38:27.075" style="s2"> And &quot;Numbers&quot; also contains priest documents</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.300" end="01:38:30.025" style="s2"> It also contains the law</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.025" end="01:38:31.800" style="s2"> To show in the form of the Ten Commandments is only in form</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.950" end="01:38:35.225" style="s2"> Because the Ten Commandments are like an abridged form of the law</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.775" end="01:38:40.600" style="s2"> Then there is the original copy of the Elohim literature</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.600" end="01:38:42.800" style="s2"> It contains the story of Abraham and Isaac</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.825" end="01:38:46.650" style="s2"> Which involves a heavenly hierarchy that includes angels</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.650" end="01:38:50.925" style="s2"> It also talked about the journey of leaving Egypt and gave the covenant</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.275" end="01:38:54.050" style="s2"> This is the concept of society</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.250" end="01:38:55.500" style="s2"> This refers to Israeli society</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.575" end="01:38:57.425" style="s2"> This idea is based on a contract with God</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.425" end="01:38:59.625" style="s2"> A list of regulations</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.725" end="01:39:01.200" style="s2"> Part of it is the ten commandments</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.250" end="01:39:04.050" style="s2"> And there are more extensive regulations than this</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.500" end="01:39:07.425" style="s2"> The last one is the original text of Deuteronomy</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.600" end="01:39:09.500" style="s2"> It contains most of the law</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.650" end="01:39:12.125" style="s2"> It also contains what is called the history of Deuteronomy</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.450" end="01:39:14.300" style="s2"> It is related to &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;Exodus&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.375" end="01:39:16.050" style="s2"> &quot;Leviticus&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot; independent</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.475" end="01:39:18.650" style="s2"> At least we understand this</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.825" end="01:39:21.125" style="s2"> The controversy about these scripts is really all-encompassing</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.125" end="01:39:24.600" style="s2"> I just touched on the knowledge of this academic field in general</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.975" end="01:39:26.575" style="s2"> But usually people think</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.575" end="01:39:30.475" style="s2"> The Bible has different authors in many different periods</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.475" end="01:39:33.875" style="s2"> My conclusion is drawn through research text analysis</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.650" end="01:39:37.700" style="s2"> I.e. try to find the same style</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.700" end="01:39:40.525" style="s2"> A long story with the same citation</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.525" end="01:39:43.025" style="s2"> People are arguing about it because</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.500" end="01:39:45.975" style="s2"> It is obviously difficult to reproduce ancient things</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.325" end="01:39:48.925" style="s2"> That&#39;s roughly it</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.175" end="01:39:53.975" style="s2"> This is the collection of opinions about these initial questions</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.150" end="01:39:55.425" style="s2"> It&#39;s important to know this</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.675" end="01:39:58.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s like a collection of stories</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.950" end="01:40:10.475" style="s2"> It’s strange to understand the first part of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.425" end="01:40:16.075" style="s2"> I want to turn to some content in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.075" end="01:40:19.000" style="s2"> This is the central element of Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.375" end="01:40:22.050" style="s2"> This is indeed a very strange idea</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.175" end="01:40:24.375" style="s2"> And it will take a long time to analyze</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.425" end="01:40:27.575" style="s2"> The following is what John the Baptist said about Christ</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.600" end="01:40:30.075" style="s2"> He said &quot;there was a way in the beginning&quot; (about 1:1)</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.075" end="01:40:31.850" style="s2"> This sentence is somewhat related to the first chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.900" end="01:40:33.450" style="s2"> &quot;In the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.600" end="01:40:36.850" style="s2"> &quot;The Tao is with God and the Tao is God&quot; (John 1:1)</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.650" end="01:40:41.425" style="s2"> These three sentences have a lot to analyze</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.600" end="01:40:44.975" style="s2"> Because they all seem to have no meaning</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.575" end="01:40:46.975" style="s2"> &quot;In the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.500" end="01:40:50.275" style="s2"> &quot;The Tao is with God and the Tao is God&quot; (John 1:1)</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.050" end="01:40:53.875" style="s2"> So the first question is what does this mean</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.200" end="01:40:55.550" style="s2"> &quot;There was Tao in the Beginning&quot; (about 1:1)</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.800" end="01:40:57.522" style="s2"> This is actually &quot;Logos&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.050" end="01:41:00.575" style="s2"> And the image of Jesus is the visualization of Logos</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.625" end="01:41:04.375" style="s2"> The view in the Gospel of John is that Christ is the Son</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.600" end="01:41:06.900" style="s2"> No matter what</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.175" end="01:41:09.700" style="s2"> He is not in a certain time and space</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.700" end="01:41:11.675" style="s2"> As a carpenter in a barren land</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.900" end="01:41:13.325" style="s2"> But outside of time and space</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.675" end="01:41:16.300" style="s2"> Still exists in an eternal form</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.300" end="01:41:17.675" style="s2"> This is what existed in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.225" end="01:41:21.825" style="s2"> For me, logos represents</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.825" end="01:41:27.000" style="s2"> What modern people mean when they talk about consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.625" end="01:41:29.450" style="s2"> Similar to this but more than this</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.450" end="01:41:30.675" style="s2"> It&#39;s like consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.675" end="01:41:34.850" style="s2"> Its ability is to comprehend and communicate</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.450" end="01:41:39.100" style="s2"> The implication lies in the existence of creatures</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.325" end="01:41:40.950" style="s2"> Especially from a phenomenological point of view</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.275" end="01:41:43.025" style="s2"> Life is experience</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.300" end="01:41:45.050" style="s2"> The existence of creatures is inseparable from consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.625" end="01:41:48.225" style="s2"> It&#39;s like saying that consciousness shoots a light on the dead object</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.350" end="01:41:49.850" style="s2"> Transform it into a creature</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.125" end="01:41:53.450" style="s2"> What else exists without consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.875" end="01:41:55.550" style="s2"> No one can experience anything</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.150" end="01:41:57.650" style="s2"> If no one can experience anything</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.675" end="01:41:59.475" style="s2"> Is there anything else?</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.575" end="01:42:00.425" style="s2"> This is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.650" end="01:42:03.950" style="s2"> The answer given in this book is no</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.950" end="01:42:05.775" style="s2"> You have to think of consciousness as</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.075" end="01:42:08.150" style="s2"> An indivisible element of reality</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.150" end="01:42:12.500" style="s2"> This is the necessary condition for reality to exist</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.100" end="01:42:15.475" style="s2"> Of course this will raise questions about the definition of reality</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.275" end="01:42:18.500" style="s2"> But the reality mentioned here refers to</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.500" end="01:42:19.825" style="s2"> As i mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.900" end="01:42:23.100" style="s2"> Refers to the weird mixture of subjective experience and the world</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.200" end="01:42:24.925" style="s2"> But the depth of this question is more than that</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.925" end="01:42:27.225" style="s2"> If no one has experienced it</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.225" end="01:42:30.650" style="s2"> There can be no obvious way to determine what exists</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.000" end="01:42:33.650" style="s2"> The whole concept of time will fall apart</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.650" end="01:42:36.625" style="s2"> At least in terms of perceiving the flow of time</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.950" end="01:42:40.200" style="s2"> The concept of size has essentially disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.200" end="01:42:42.275" style="s2"> Because there is nothing to measure it</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.975" end="01:42:44.975" style="s2"> Causality also seems to cease to exist</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.025" end="01:42:49.850" style="s2"> We can&#39;t understand the consciousness is really ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.575" end="01:42:52.100" style="s2"> We can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.250" end="01:42:55.500" style="s2"> What gives us the light of life in our body</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.900" end="01:42:57.600" style="s2"> What happened in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.600" end="01:42:58.600" style="s2"> At least in part</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.600" end="01:43:01.850" style="s2"> Is to connect this consciousness with divinity</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.325" end="01:43:06.350" style="s2"> Now think about it, is this a reasonable proposition?</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.025" end="01:43:08.750" style="s2"> This question is complicated</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.750" end="01:43:12.375" style="s2"> But at least we will find that this description is a bit problematic</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.075" end="01:43:16.025" style="s2"> Because there is a miraculous experience</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.025" end="01:43:18.025" style="s2"> And existence depends on consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.450" end="01:43:20.475" style="s2"> People always prevaricate after just explaining it</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.475" end="01:43:22.325" style="s2"> But there seems to be no good result</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.575" end="01:43:24.175" style="s2"> And this is something to consider</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.775" end="01:43:26.500" style="s2"> I think it is worth considering</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.750" end="01:43:29.975" style="s2"> People don’t like to be seen as unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.975" end="01:43:33.225" style="s2"> Their reaction will be intense</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.775" end="01:43:36.075" style="s2"> If someone thinks you are unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.075" end="01:43:37.125" style="s2"> You will be upset</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.150" end="01:43:38.533" style="s2"> If someone thinks you have no free will</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.533" end="01:43:40.125" style="s2"> You will be upset</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.475" end="01:43:42.375" style="s2"> Because that means you are only fully confined to</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.400" end="01:43:44.375" style="s2"> In your behavior</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.425" end="01:43:46.250" style="s2"> There is no remedy</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.250" end="01:43:49.525" style="s2"> At the same time you are not responsible for your actions</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.300" end="01:43:52.600" style="s2"> Our culture the law of our culture</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.650" end="01:43:54.025" style="s2"> Are built on</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.975" end="01:43:56.050" style="s2"> People are consciously based</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.225" end="01:43:58.800" style="s2"> People have experience</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.800" end="01:44:00.875" style="s2"> Make decisions and be responsible</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.150" end="01:44:02.650" style="s2"> This embodies the element of free will</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.050" end="01:44:06.200" style="s2"> You can raise objections from a philosophical point of view, of course it’s fine</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.400" end="01:44:08.950" style="s2"> But the point is that this is how we behave</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.950" end="01:44:12.175" style="s2"> And this is the premise of our legal system</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.550" end="01:44:13.825" style="s2"> There is something deeper in this</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.825" end="01:44:18.150" style="s2"> Because you are restricted by law</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.950" end="01:44:21.725" style="s2"> But the law is also restricted by you</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.975" end="01:44:25.325" style="s2"> That is to say in a well working</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.675" end="01:44:28.075" style="s2"> Under a reasonable democratic system</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.425" end="01:44:31.625" style="s2"> You have intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.150" end="01:44:33.750" style="s2"> This is the source of your rights</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.375" end="01:44:35.625" style="s2"> Even if you are a murderer</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.000" end="01:44:39.100" style="s2"> We must also say that the law cannot do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.100" end="01:44:41.250" style="s2"> Because you have a divine side</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.850" end="01:44:43.150" style="s2"> What does this mean</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.150" end="01:44:44.125" style="s2"> Part of its meaning is</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.175" end="01:44:45.900" style="s2"> Part of you is conscious</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.900" end="01:44:47.825" style="s2"> Ability to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.825" end="01:44:49.925" style="s2"> Like you are a self-contained world</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.575" end="01:44:53.675" style="s2"> You can use it to contribute to others, which is valuable</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.350" end="01:44:58.325" style="s2"> You can learn new knowledge to transform the structure of society</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.575" end="01:45:00.675" style="s2"> And can invent new ways to deal with the world</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.175" end="01:45:02.425" style="s2"> You can do it all</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.700" end="01:45:04.050" style="s2"> This is part of you</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.050" end="01:45:08.700" style="s2"> This involves this</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.700" end="01:45:11.175" style="s2"> The concept of logos</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.875" end="01:45:14.125" style="s2"> For the absolutely chaotic reality</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.150" end="01:45:17.850" style="s2"> Logos are indispensable</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.850" end="01:45:20.925" style="s2"> Beyond expressing its existence as reality through experience</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.575" end="01:45:22.500" style="s2"> This is an amazing view</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.525" end="01:45:24.425" style="s2"> Because it allows your consciousness to act in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.850" end="01:45:27.375" style="s2"> An indispensable role</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.150" end="01:45:29.125" style="s2"> You can refute it</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.275" end="01:45:32.600" style="s2"> But you can’t simply erase it</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.300" end="01:45:34.350" style="s2"> Because first</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.500" end="01:45:36.825" style="s2"> We are the most complicated thing in existence</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.825" end="01:45:40.775" style="s2"> At least in the known world is quite complicated</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.850" end="01:45:43.000" style="s2"> We are incredibly complicated</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.400" end="01:45:46.450" style="s2"> There are many universes outside</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.475" end="01:45:48.300" style="s2"> But there are many universes within</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.625" end="01:45:51.400" style="s2"> Which of the two is greater is hard to say</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.600" end="01:45:52.800" style="s2"> Unless you use something irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.800" end="01:45:54.175" style="s2"> Such as relative size</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.200" end="01:45:56.750" style="s2"> But this is really not a strict plan</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.400" end="01:45:59.425" style="s2"> No matter what you have</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.450" end="01:46:03.525" style="s2"> Experience reality and the ability to transform reality</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.525" end="01:46:05.050" style="s2"> This is a very strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.050" end="01:46:08.600" style="s2"> You can imagine the future in your imagination</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.950" end="01:46:11.550" style="s2"> Then you can show it in practice</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.950" end="01:46:14.350" style="s2"> Participate in the creation process</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.600" end="01:46:16.050" style="s2"> This is an angle to think about this issue</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.450" end="01:46:17.175" style="s2"> That&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.175" end="01:46:21.950" style="s2"> I think the first chapter of Genesis is related to this point of view</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.975" end="01:46:24.375" style="s2"> That is, human beings are all created in the image of divinity</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.400" end="01:46:25.300" style="s2"> Whether it is a man or a woman</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.300" end="01:46:29.425" style="s2"> But it’s interesting that feminists are always</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.425" end="01:46:34.925" style="s2"> Criticize Christianity as an outright patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.700" end="01:46:38.400" style="s2"> Of course they will criticize everything as patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.450" end="01:46:40.875" style="s2"> So this is rarely a whimsical idea</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.100" end="01:46:43.775" style="s2"> But I think this is definitely a miracle</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.775" end="01:46:47.450" style="s2"> The beginning of a document is straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.725" end="01:46:49.275" style="s2"> Without any hesitation</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.275" end="01:46:53.700" style="s2"> Said that the brilliance of divinity is connected with Tao</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.700" end="01:46:55.150" style="s2"> Tao gives birth to life again</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.150" end="01:46:57.550" style="s2"> It is reflected equally in men and women</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.025" end="01:46:59.175" style="s2"> This is really awesome</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.250" end="01:47:01.675" style="s2"> Like I said before, you will definitely think</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.675" end="01:47:03.375" style="s2"> Will you take this seriously</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.700" end="01:47:04.950" style="s2"> What you want to ask is</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.325" end="01:47:08.313" style="s2"> What will happen if you don&#39;t take it seriously, right</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.525" end="01:47:11.975" style="s2"> Read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.750" end="01:47:16.850" style="s2"> This is among the existing works</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.850" end="01:47:20.325" style="s2"> The best inquiry about this thinking strategy</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.325" end="01:47:23.825" style="s2"> In Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.850" end="01:47:26.575" style="s2"> The hero&#39;s name is Raskolnikov</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.900" end="01:47:29.300" style="s2"> He believes that other people have no intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.125" end="01:47:31.875" style="s2"> Of course he can do whatever he wants</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.275" end="01:47:34.400" style="s2"> Only cowardice will stop him</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.400" end="01:47:37.725" style="s2"> If the value of others is just an arbitrary superstition</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.000" end="01:47:41.875" style="s2"> What else is left</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.250" end="01:47:44.625" style="s2"> Why can&#39;t I act recklessly every time</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.100" end="01:47:46.725" style="s2"> This is the way mental patients think</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.300" end="01:47:48.400" style="s2"> So this is what Raskolnikov did</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.400" end="01:47:50.750" style="s2"> He killed a very disgusting person</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.750" end="01:47:52.925" style="s2"> And he had a good reason to kill her</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.975" end="01:47:54.925" style="s2"> He was half-starved and a little mentally disturbed</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.950" end="01:47:56.625" style="s2"> And obsessed with an ideology</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.675" end="01:47:58.375" style="s2"> This is depicted very well in the book</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.700" end="01:48:00.800" style="s2"> And he discovered one thing after killing her</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.800" end="01:48:05.425" style="s2"> That is Raskolnikov before and after the murder</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.450" end="01:48:09.725" style="s2"> Pan Ruo two are completely different because he broke a commandment</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.725" end="01:48:12.575" style="s2"> He has committed a serious violation</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.150" end="01:48:16.750" style="s2"> &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is what I know</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.750" end="01:48:18.700" style="s2"> The best inquiry into this situation</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.700" end="01:48:20.975" style="s2"> This situation is if you firmly believe that there is no</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.975" end="01:48:23.050" style="s2"> What will happen in any divinity</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.775" end="01:48:30.000" style="s2"> Most people I know are staunch atheists</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.200" end="01:48:32.350" style="s2"> I also understand why they become staunch atheists</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.350" end="01:48:33.825" style="s2"> They will not be like Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.825" end="01:48:35.350" style="s2"> Such people raise objections</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.725" end="01:48:39.000" style="s2"> As far as I know, I didn’t find that in Crime and Punishment</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.000" end="01:48:39.975" style="s2"> What logical loopholes exist</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.975" end="01:48:42.250" style="s2"> I think he is very accurate in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.625" end="01:48:45.150" style="s2"> At this point Dostoyevsky is really a strange man</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.725" end="01:48:47.300" style="s2"> In his other book &quot;The Demons&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.475" end="01:48:50.875" style="s2"> Depicts a political situation</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.875" end="01:48:53.375" style="s2"> No different from where we are now</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.725" end="01:48:55.550" style="s2"> Some of them firmly believe</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.700" end="01:48:58.350" style="s2"> Rationalist utopia and atheistic views</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.700" end="01:48:59.650" style="s2"> They have great energy</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.875" end="01:49:01.800" style="s2"> Then they set off a revolution</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.275" end="01:49:03.500" style="s2"> These are all powerful views</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.975" end="01:49:06.050" style="s2"> Among them is a character named Stavrokin</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.850" end="01:49:10.250" style="s2"> It also guides practice with such a premise</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.250" end="01:49:12.400" style="s2"> That is that human beings have no inner essence</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.400" end="01:49:13.375" style="s2"> No intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.000" end="01:49:16.075" style="s2"> This is another wonderful inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.075" end="01:49:22.000" style="s2"> Dostoevsky predicted the development trend of society</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.000" end="01:49:23.400" style="s2"> If you really follow this road</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.425" end="01:49:25.375" style="s2"> He became a true saying after ages</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.050" end="01:49:29.175" style="s2"> After reading &quot;The Demon&quot;, you will find it incredible</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.175" end="01:49:30.975" style="s2"> Or &quot;The Enchanter&quot; depends on the difference in translation</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.275" end="01:49:33.325" style="s2"> When you read Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.325" end="01:49:34.400" style="s2"> You will feel this way in &quot;Gulag Islands&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.725" end="01:49:36.750" style="s2"> The first book is a fictional work and a prophecy</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.750" end="01:49:38.175" style="s2"> And the second one is to take a look</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.275" end="01:49:40.475" style="s2"> What happened here is exactly what Dostoyevsky predicted</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.475" end="01:49:42.225" style="s2"> The reasons are the same</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.825" end="01:49:44.025" style="s2"> This is really amazing</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.500" end="01:49:46.775" style="s2"> So the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.775" end="01:49:49.250" style="s2"> Do you really object to the following views</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.725" end="01:49:54.900" style="s2"> A Consciousness is an indispensable part of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.950" end="01:49:58.775" style="s2"> B Consciousness is likely to be considered divine</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.900" end="01:50:01.725" style="s2"> C Does it manifest in everyone?</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.250" end="01:50:04.950" style="s2"> And if you are not a criminal</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.175" end="01:50:06.700" style="s2"> Ask yourself if you don&#39;t act accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.350" end="01:50:09.025" style="s2"> Ask yourself what it means</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.275" end="01:50:12.225" style="s2"> Does it reflect reality? Is it a metaphor?</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.300" end="01:50:14.675" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s a complicated metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.675" end="01:50:16.850" style="s2"> We use it to organize our society</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.175" end="01:50:18.125" style="s2"> It&#39;s very possible</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.025" end="01:50:21.600" style="s2"> But even a metaphor, it is true enough</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.600" end="01:50:24.400" style="s2"> So that we play with it regardless of our own safety</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.775" end="01:50:27.200" style="s2"> And it also takes a long time for people to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.525" end="01:50:30.950" style="s2"> This is the first chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.125" end="01:50:33.750" style="s2"> But I might end here</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.375" end="01:50:35.900" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s half past nine</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.400" end="01:50:38.600" style="s2"> But we didn’t even mention the first sentence</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.175" end="01:50:54.425" style="s2"> I want to read something</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.425" end="01:50:56.675" style="s2"> Make an introduction for the next lecture</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.475" end="01:51:00.225" style="s2"> I will start from a set related to divinity</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.250" end="01:51:02.575" style="s2"> Pick some reading</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.275" end="01:51:07.200" style="s2"> Let’s go back to the first few words of the lecture</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.225" end="01:51:08.975" style="s2"> By the way, I don’t know that in the end we can cover</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.975" end="01:51:10.500" style="s2"> How many &quot;Bible&quot; stories</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.500" end="01:51:13.075" style="s2"> Because I&#39;m trying to figure out my clues while teaching</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.200" end="01:51:16.700" style="s2"> There is a concept in Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.025" end="01:51:20.275" style="s2"> Call the image of God the &quot;Trinity&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.150" end="01:51:23.025" style="s2"> The element of the Father</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.325" end="01:51:24.650" style="s2"> Element of the son</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.650" end="01:51:26.050" style="s2"> There are also elements of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.050" end="01:51:29.825" style="s2"> It’s a bit like the traditional spirit</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.825" end="01:51:34.725" style="s2"> Humans are the latest incarnation of this tradition</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.725" end="01:51:41.050" style="s2"> This traditional living body and the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.050" end="01:51:46.250" style="s2"> Makes the relationship between the individual and the spirit possible</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.250" end="01:51:49.825" style="s2"> I want to quickly go over</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.825" end="01:51:53.600" style="s2"> Some classic and metaphorical attributes of God</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.925" end="01:51:56.175" style="s2"> So that we can have a rough idea later</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.200" end="01:51:59.075" style="s2"> In order to understand that when we look back at the first chapter of Genesis and</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.200" end="01:52:03.457" style="s2"> Discuss what God is talking about when he shapes creatures from chaos</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.775" end="01:52:06.025" style="s2"> There is the Father&#39;s side here</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.050" end="01:52:09.950" style="s2"> So God is like a father</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.350" end="01:52:12.200" style="s2"> You can make a contract with</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.425" end="01:52:13.600" style="s2"> You can also make an agreement</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.925" end="01:52:15.000" style="s2"> But think about it now</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.150" end="01:52:16.450" style="s2"> It&#39;s like money</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.025" end="01:52:19.200" style="s2"> Because money is an agreement with the future</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.725" end="01:52:21.550" style="s2"> The world we build</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.800" end="01:52:24.400" style="s2"> Is to enable you to negotiate with the future</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.925" end="01:52:28.725" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think when we are doing this</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.725" end="01:52:30.350" style="s2"> Didn&#39;t realize it at all</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.850" end="01:52:33.350" style="s2"> You can see the future as real when you act</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.350" end="01:52:35.625" style="s2"> Because there is a traditional spirit that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.625" end="01:52:38.275" style="s2"> Treat the future as an object of negotiation when acting</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.475" end="01:52:39.800" style="s2"> This is why you will make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.100" end="01:52:44.650" style="s2"> We have a long history of sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.675" end="01:52:46.050" style="s2"> But now it’s only done on a psychological level.</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.200" end="01:52:49.250" style="s2"> We know you can sacrifice the valuable things in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.875" end="01:52:52.175" style="s2"> I hope you are with some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.175" end="01:52:54.175" style="s2"> Negotiating something that represents a transcendent future</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.800" end="01:52:57.375" style="s2"> This is an amazing human discovery</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.775" end="01:52:59.025" style="s2"> No other creature can do this</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.375" end="01:53:00.975" style="s2"> Treat the future as real when you act</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.450" end="01:53:04.125" style="s2"> Knowing that you can negotiate with reality</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.225" end="01:53:05.725" style="s2"> And it really works</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.050" end="01:53:06.950" style="s2"> This is incredible</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.500" end="01:53:09.000" style="s2"> It will respond to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.600" end="01:53:10.725" style="s2"> It also answers prayer</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.300" end="01:53:13.450" style="s2"> By the way, I didn&#39;t say these are true</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.450" end="01:53:17.225" style="s2"> I&#39;m just talking about what this rough concept represents</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.075" end="01:53:19.475" style="s2"> It will punish and reward</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.875" end="01:53:21.250" style="s2"> It will judge and forgive</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.650" end="01:53:22.675" style="s2"> It is not natural</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.475" end="01:53:26.775" style="s2"> Judaism and Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.775" end="01:53:28.225" style="s2"> A bit strange</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.600" end="01:53:30.600" style="s2"> That is that God and nature are not the same thing at all</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.725" end="01:53:31.600" style="s2"> No matter what god is</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.150" end="01:53:33.825" style="s2"> He is partly represented in the logos</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.900" end="01:53:35.850" style="s2"> And logos are separate from nature</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.850" end="01:53:38.400" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s like consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.950" end="01:53:41.100" style="s2"> It is abstracted from the natural world</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.725" end="01:53:44.100" style="s2"> It created the Garden of Eden for mankind</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.100" end="01:53:46.225" style="s2"> But drove us out for the sin of disobedience</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.225" end="01:53:47.850" style="s2"> It can only be viewed from a distance and not playable</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.600" end="01:53:49.875" style="s2"> It gives us free will</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.300" end="01:53:51.800" style="s2"> Stay away from it is hell</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.175" end="01:53:53.425" style="s2"> To stay away is death</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.825" end="01:53:57.500" style="s2"> It is revealed in dogmatic and mysterious experience</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.750" end="01:53:58.750" style="s2"> It is the law</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.225" end="01:54:00.950" style="s2"> This is probably the Father’s side</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.725" end="01:54:03.350" style="s2"> Look at the side of the son</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.025" end="01:54:05.550" style="s2"> It creates order in chaos</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.725" end="01:54:08.550" style="s2"> It kills the dragon and feeds the people with its flesh and blood</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.000" end="01:54:10.950" style="s2"> It finds treasure to save chastity</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.325" end="01:54:13.025" style="s2"> It is the blood of Christ</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.475" end="01:54:15.275" style="s2"> It is a scapegoat for the tragic victim</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.300" end="01:54:18.325" style="s2"> Is also the savior of eternal triumph</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.800" end="01:54:19.750" style="s2"> It cares about the abandoned</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.575" end="01:54:21.850" style="s2"> It died but reborn</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.750" end="01:54:24.625" style="s2"> It is the king of kings</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.325" end="01:54:26.225" style="s2"> It is not a country</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.725" end="01:54:29.650" style="s2"> But at the same time fulfilling and criticizing the country</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.250" end="01:54:31.625" style="s2"> It came to the perfect apartment</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.525" end="01:54:34.300" style="s2"> It also pursues wonderland or heaven</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.300" end="01:54:35.850" style="s2"> It can save lives from hell</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.400" end="01:54:37.675" style="s2"> It also cares about the abandoned people</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.200" end="01:54:41.025" style="s2"> It is the foundation and cornerstone of rejection</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.500" end="01:54:43.275" style="s2"> It is the spirit of the law</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.450" end="01:54:46.725" style="s2"> Finally, the side of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.725" end="01:54:49.425" style="s2"> It is similar to the human soul</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.025" end="01:54:51.325" style="s2"> It is the voice of the prophet</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.750" end="01:54:54.475" style="s2"> It&#39;s the murmur of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.875" end="01:54:56.125" style="s2"> The truth of its words</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.425" end="01:54:58.125" style="s2"> It is inspired by music</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.300" end="01:55:02.150" style="s2"> It is the enemy of arrogance and resentment</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.575" end="01:55:03.650" style="s2"> It is the water of life</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.075" end="01:55:05.575" style="s2"> It burns without embers</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.825" end="01:55:07.175" style="s2"> It is a dazzling light</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.800" end="01:55:12.250" style="s2"> This is a very complete set of poetic metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.550" end="01:55:15.350" style="s2"> What do you say</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.350" end="01:55:19.150" style="s2"> It&#39;s all a glimpse of a transcendent ideal model</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.150" end="01:55:20.625" style="s2"> This is the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.625" end="01:55:22.675" style="s2"> They are all glimpses of transcendent ideals</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.000" end="01:55:25.125" style="s2"> They also have clear meanings</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.150" end="01:55:28.275" style="s2"> While we are conducting this series of lectures</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.275" end="01:55:31.225" style="s2"> To a certain extent, it is also understanding the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.475" end="01:55:36.875" style="s2"> What we are talking about now</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.925" end="01:55:39.000" style="s2"> At least a brief description of these</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.250" end="01:55:42.475" style="s2"> &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1)</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.475" end="01:55:44.325" style="s2"> We know that in the next story</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.500" end="01:55:46.225" style="s2"> It is closely related to logos</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.225" end="01:55:47.800" style="s2"> We know it is connected with Tao</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.800" end="01:55:48.700" style="s2"> Also connected with consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.200" end="01:55:49.825" style="s2"> And we also know</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.075" end="01:55:53.100" style="s2"> It is also connected to God no matter what he is</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.200" end="01:55:56.850" style="s2"> Then I will unfold a metaphorical picture</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.850" end="01:55:58.325" style="s2"> At least it portrays God in part</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.325" end="01:55:59.850" style="s2"> Now we are right</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.850" end="01:56:03.125" style="s2"> A little understanding of the existence of the creation world</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.375" end="01:56:05.125" style="s2"> &quot;Earth is emptiness and chaos&quot; (Genesis 1:2)</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.125" end="01:56:08.550" style="s2"> This is the prehistoric state of chaos and ambiguity</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.925" end="01:56:10.875" style="s2"> &quot;Darkness</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.275" end="01:56:13.825" style="s2"> &quot;God&#39;s Spirit is running on the water&quot; (Genesis 1:2)</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.175" end="01:56:17.425" style="s2"> &quot;God said &quot;Let there be light&quot; and there will be light&quot; (Genesis 1:3)</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.175" end="01:56:19.375" style="s2"> We&#39;re going to end here</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.125" end="01:56:22.125" style="s2"> Because we are ready</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.400" end="01:56:23.925" style="s2"> To the beginning of this book</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.925" end="01:56:26.175" style="s2"> Took a tentative step</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.200" end="01:56:31.150" style="s2"> It’s important to organize your conceptual framework properly</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.200" end="01:56:32.875" style="s2"> So you can experience</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.450" end="01:56:35.850" style="s2"> The direction of travel and the possible meaning in it</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.900" end="01:56:38.475" style="s2"> Then i have done my best today</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.125" end="01:56:40.075" style="s2"> How to say it</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.100" end="01:56:42.975" style="s2"> Explaining this word painstakingly makes me feel</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.700" end="01:56:47.075" style="s2"> But this is not as simple as talking about it, so you know</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.350" end="01:56:49.700" style="s2"> It took a long time to reach this point</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.700" end="01:56:51.500" style="s2"> Not so unreasonable</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.500" end="01:56:52.525" style="s2"> At this moment you can finally realize a bit</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.525" end="01:56:53.275" style="s2"> About the meaning of this word</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.775" end="01:56:58.775" style="s2"> It is far from reaching</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.200" end="01:56:59.875" style="s2"> It is not</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.350" end="01:57:02.307" style="s2"> I thought I could go a little deeper than I currently</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.525" end="01:57:05.275" style="s2"> So be it, thank you very much</p>
