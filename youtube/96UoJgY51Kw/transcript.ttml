<p begin="00:00:02.120" end="00:00:07.100" style="s2">there&#39;s another side as many sides of</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.399" end="00:00:08.540" style="s2">the psychedelic world and one side that</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.100" end="00:00:10.820" style="s2">I know is a particular interest of yours</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.540" end="00:00:13.100" style="s2">is the micro dosing side of psychic</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.820" end="00:00:14.779" style="s2">herbs and micro dosing is where you take</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:16.490" style="s2">a sub perceptual dose of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.779" end="00:00:17.720" style="s2">psychedelics now people have different</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.490" end="00:00:20.150" style="s2">attitudes about this so my first</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.720" end="00:00:21.980" style="s2">question would be what are the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.150" end="00:00:24.199" style="s2">attitudes that you see arising in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.980" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">culture about the use of micro dosing</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.199" end="00:00:31.339" style="s2">different psychedelics yeah so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.199" end="00:00:35.030" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t inspire the usual</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.339" end="00:00:36.950" style="s2">population doing that because it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.030" end="00:00:40.730" style="s2">an illegal scheduled substance</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.950" end="00:00:44.900" style="s2">absolutely there there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.730" end="00:00:47.180" style="s2">risks induced and people&#39;s are will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.900" end="00:00:50.420" style="s2">skeptical anyway so we are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.180" end="00:00:53.660" style="s2">a psychedelic user population which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.420" end="00:00:57.140" style="s2">already using these kind of things and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.660" end="00:01:00.770" style="s2">think there are a lot of aspects about</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.140" end="00:01:02.570" style="s2">that one is or one major aspect is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.770" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">you can take a psychedelic on a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.570" end="00:01:08.210" style="s2">regular basis without having all these</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:10.759" style="s2">irritating distracting effects and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.210" end="00:01:14.179" style="s2">therefore a lot of people think oh I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.759" end="00:01:16.670" style="s2">do LSD without getting as a risk of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.179" end="00:01:18.469" style="s2">being fragmented or getting on a horror</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.670" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">trip we&#39;re all getting a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.469" end="00:01:24.229" style="s2">experience you know it&#39;s a kind of risk</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:27.289" style="s2">minimization in the understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.229" end="00:01:29.749" style="s2">people that&#39;s one aspect another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.289" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">is that these substances might do</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.749" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">something to the human organism which</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:38.950" style="s2">might be good even if we don&#39;t dose them</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:42.200" style="s2">so much that we have these psychological</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.950" end="00:01:44.030" style="s2">alterations is this it from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.200" end="00:01:48.229" style="s2">pharmacological point and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.030" end="00:01:51.289" style="s2">pharmacologist to this might be possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.229" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">but this is there&#39;s up to now no</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.289" end="00:01:57.829" style="s2">reliable AB evidence to my eyes that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:02:00.380" style="s2">is really the case this is not that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.829" end="00:02:03.020" style="s2">the reports are not true but they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.380" end="00:02:06.469" style="s2">still anecdotal might have been placebo</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.020" end="00:02:08.990" style="s2">induced and so on so we still don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.469" end="00:02:11.780" style="s2">exactly from a scientific point of view</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.990" end="00:02:15.049" style="s2">if this is really a method which can</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.780" end="00:02:18.109" style="s2">alter whatever kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.049" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">like a creativity creative thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.109" end="00:02:24.349" style="s2">stuff like that what we know is you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">can&#39;t other creative sinking or your</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.349" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">thoughts or your thought patterns if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">are not doing a dose which is uttering</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:34.969" style="s2">your thought patterns if you use a dose</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:37.969" style="s2">which is sub perceptual it means you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.969" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">can&#39;t detect it and so you can&#39;t detect</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.969" end="00:02:43.219" style="s2">changes in your thoughts so this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:47.750" style="s2">beyond the definition what I would like</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.219" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">to introduce here is that when I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.750" end="00:02:52.159" style="s2">written the recent book which I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:55.669" style="s2">written about my as a science of micro</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.159" end="00:02:57.859" style="s2">dosing I came across a kind of 50</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.669" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">studies in the past which have been done</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.859" end="00:03:02.750" style="s2">with very low doses nobody knows about</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:04.549" style="s2">that the whole internet is free of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.750" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">there is no knowledge and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.549" end="00:03:09.349" style="s2">the Internet can generate illusions</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:11.540" style="s2">because they people don&#39;t look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.349" end="00:03:15.349" style="s2">past anymore they are just in the now</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.540" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">which is mindful but maybe idiotic in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.349" end="00:03:20.150" style="s2">another sense that they ignore the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:22.129" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know about and what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.150" end="00:03:25.069" style="s2">know from these early studies is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.129" end="00:03:28.190" style="s2">above 20 micrograms you get a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.069" end="00:03:32.599" style="s2">kind of effect which might in some rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.190" end="00:03:35.569" style="s2">cases in behave in a way that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.599" end="00:03:38.359" style="s2">might become a little more creative but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.569" end="00:03:40.639" style="s2">I would bet that because of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.359" end="00:03:43.750" style="s2">and sative it is about the substance</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.639" end="00:03:46.909" style="s2">even if he would those them within</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.750" end="00:03:49.729" style="s2">quality known and purity known stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.909" end="00:03:53.269" style="s2">could give everybody 20 micrograms or</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.729" end="00:03:55.129" style="s2">let&#39;s say 30 or something they would</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.269" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">still have completely different</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.129" end="00:04:00.979" style="s2">reactions somewhat and so therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:03.879" style="s2">very hard to dose in the real what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.979" end="00:04:07.310" style="s2">call above 20 micrograms where you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.879" end="00:04:10.849" style="s2">some kind of effect I would like to call</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.310" end="00:04:14.299" style="s2">that mini dosing coming from 20 to 50</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.849" end="00:04:16.519" style="s2">and a lot of the people which have micro</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.299" end="00:04:19.099" style="s2">dosed in the past for example about</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.519" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">Huisman the discoverer of LSD has has</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.099" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">done in a more or less erratic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">let&#39;s say five to seven times a year at</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:30.729" style="s2">maximum he did 30 to 90 milli</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">meet micrograms and that is quite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.729" end="00:04:35.740" style="s2">different deal then you have some</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:37.990" style="s2">effects it&#39;s not a full-blown experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.740" end="00:04:43.270" style="s2">yes we know from recent research that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.990" end="00:04:45.610" style="s2">the full-blown LSD experience needs 200</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:48.220" style="s2">micrograms then you have the full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.610" end="00:04:50.470" style="s2">effects if you go lower you have less</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.220" end="00:04:53.530" style="s2">effects it&#39;s not a bad thing it might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.470" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">even good but we still have to define</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.530" end="00:04:59.590" style="s2">where what micro dosing in that sense is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">yes it&#39;s really tough isn&#39;t it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.590" end="00:05:06.969" style="s2">it&#39;s tough to get a grip on what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:08.620" style="s2">full LSD experience would really be I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.969" end="00:05:10.719" style="s2">mean do you mean to refer to the peak</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.620" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">breakthrough mystical experience okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.719" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">you know no it&#39;s it&#39;s just that we know</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:17.889" style="s2">from the question your profiles yes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:19.870" style="s2">from clinical experience that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.889" end="00:05:23.259" style="s2">get much more if you get a higher dose</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.870" end="00:05:26.009" style="s2">and you get somewhat less if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.259" end="00:05:28.629" style="s2">lower dose so we know that all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.009" end="00:05:31.810" style="s2">responses on these questionnaires they</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.629" end="00:05:34.029" style="s2">got maximum activated when you have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.810" end="00:05:36.759" style="s2">kind of those and you got much less if</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.029" end="00:05:40.060" style="s2">you get lower doses okay so but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.759" end="00:05:43.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean like with a car you can run</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.060" end="00:05:47.740" style="s2">200 miles let&#39;s say with an sports car</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.479" end="00:05:50.889" style="s2">but you usually run 50 right and so if</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.740" end="00:05:54.250" style="s2">is if speed of fifty is much more usable</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.889" end="00:05:56.650" style="s2">for you in the average day then running</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.250" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">200 you know you know what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.650" end="00:06:01.719" style="s2">about yes right so it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:03.789" style="s2">a hundred micrograms for example can do</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.719" end="00:06:07.389" style="s2">a lot in respect to psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.789" end="00:06:09.819" style="s2">processing which might you&#39;d which might</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.389" end="00:06:11.529" style="s2">be not as optimal with a full dose yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.819" end="00:06:13.180" style="s2">and so therefore I&#39;m not discriminating</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.529" end="00:06:18.159" style="s2">lower dosages or something yes no</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.180" end="00:06:22.300" style="s2">absolutely I mean it&#39;s it one thing for</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.159" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">me that other eye that I not quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.300" end="00:06:27.610" style="s2">seeing as much in conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:31.060" style="s2">psychedelics is really what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.610" end="00:06:34.300" style="s2">fundamental aim is whether whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.060" end="00:06:37.379" style="s2">for an individual&#39;s life or a collective</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.300" end="00:06:37.379" style="s2">now people are talking</p>
