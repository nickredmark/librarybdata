<p begin="00:19:00.940" end="00:19:04.270" style="s2">for continuing to remind me that our</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.530" end="00:19:06.130" style="s2">sage doesn&#39;t have to be the Buddha I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.270" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">not Christian but my experience with</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.130" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">Jesus is it negative and today I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:14.770" style="s2">able to connect to my moms Jesus and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">that felt deeply nourishing thank you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.770" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:21.730" style="s2">not Carolyn thank you for sharing that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:25.510" style="s2">want to encourage people not to do what</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.730" end="00:19:27.430" style="s2">Kira has done so here isn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.510" end="00:19:32.220" style="s2">posing a question of course please keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.430" end="00:19:35.020" style="s2">up the wonderful questions that&#39;s yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.220" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">but that&#39;s what Kira has done she is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.020" end="00:19:40.780" style="s2">also she&#39;s and I don&#39;t mean she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">doing this in any egocentric fashion</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.780" end="00:19:46.390" style="s2">whatsoever that she&#39;s sharing how she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">watering her Buddha or to be more</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.390" end="00:19:51.730" style="s2">appropriate to what her comment how she</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:54.130" style="s2">is watering her inner sage and it would</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.730" end="00:19:56.170" style="s2">be wonderful if people and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.130" end="00:19:58.510" style="s2">anything at length as we have limited</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.170" end="00:20:02.980" style="s2">time but in addition to questions if</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.510" end="00:20:05.470" style="s2">they in you know a concise manner shared</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.980" end="00:20:08.820" style="s2">complex shared by a comment right</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.470" end="00:20:13.000" style="s2">moments of connection moments of insight</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.820" end="00:20:14.740" style="s2">moments where they were celebrating in</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.000" end="00:20:17.620" style="s2">the religious sense of the word of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.740" end="00:20:21.330" style="s2">celebration the Buddha the Dharma and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.620" end="00:20:26.920" style="s2">the Sangha so Kira thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.330" end="00:20:30.390" style="s2">this is something that I learned but my</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.920" end="00:20:33.610" style="s2">friend my dear friend and collaborator</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.390" end="00:20:35.880" style="s2">christopher master pho has also put it</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.610" end="00:20:39.210" style="s2">he said to me he has such a lyrical</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.880" end="00:20:43.270" style="s2">naturally lyrical and penetrating and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.210" end="00:20:47.020" style="s2">perspicacious way of speaking but he</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.270" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">articulates this idea about how just</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.020" end="00:20:50.800" style="s2">like we have our mother tongue many of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:53.230" style="s2">us have a mother religion</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.800" end="00:20:55.450" style="s2">we come to reject it to some degree we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.230" end="00:20:58.120" style="s2">don&#39;t identify with it anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.450" end="00:21:03.940" style="s2">nevertheless like our mother tongue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.120" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">deep in us and and young actually also</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.940" end="00:21:08.770" style="s2">pointed to this point - I think in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:12.490" style="s2">certain important ways and so learning</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.770" end="00:21:14.650" style="s2">how to relate I really I really resonate</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.490" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying is I was brought</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.650" end="00:21:19.570" style="s2">up a Christian but in a form of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:22.060" style="s2">Christianity that was actually deeply I</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.570" end="00:21:25.810" style="s2">think the right word is traumatizing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.060" end="00:21:27.550" style="s2">me but coming to reappraise sheight</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.810" end="00:21:31.690" style="s2">where I mean that word appreciation in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.550" end="00:21:33.250" style="s2">the sense of my deep gratitude but also</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.690" end="00:21:34.930" style="s2">that that that deep learning and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.250" end="00:21:36.940" style="s2">transformation like we people do music</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.930" end="00:21:38.530" style="s2">appreciation and also that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.940" end="00:21:39.850" style="s2">coming to sense the value of something</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.530" end="00:21:42.130" style="s2">more like when we say the value of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.850" end="00:21:47.170" style="s2">something is appreciating so I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.130" end="00:21:48.520" style="s2">to appreciate Jesus I hope that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.170" end="00:21:50.590" style="s2">sound pretentious at all because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.520" end="00:21:57.310" style="s2">not my intent I&#39;ve come to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.590" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">Jesus much more profoundly and so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.310" end="00:22:04.300" style="s2">way in which your inner sage will</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:07.390" style="s2">interact with for those of us who have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.300" end="00:22:09.580" style="s2">mother religion with our mother religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.390" end="00:22:11.560" style="s2">or as a young might put with our default</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.580" end="00:22:13.390" style="s2">because if we weren&#39;t brought up we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.560" end="00:22:16.060" style="s2">a default spirituality rumbling around</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.390" end="00:22:17.920" style="s2">in our unconscious I think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.060" end="00:22:19.810" style="s2">important part of this path that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.920" end="00:22:22.930" style="s2">on it&#39;s a very important part of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.810" end="00:22:25.690" style="s2">possible so thank you Kara for for</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.930" end="00:22:27.880" style="s2">bringing that out and for sharing that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.690" end="00:22:31.810" style="s2">encourage other people please don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.880" end="00:22:35.560" style="s2">rambling I have a limited time but very</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.810" end="00:22:38.710" style="s2">concise shared comments of celebration</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.560" end="00:22:41.550" style="s2">and appreciation are also something we</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.710" end="00:22:43.780" style="s2">should be looking for in the Q&amp;A section</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.550" end="00:22:46.300" style="s2">that&#39;s all unfortunately we have time</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.780" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">for today we will be able to answer more</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.300" end="00:22:51.610" style="s2">questions tomorrow I want to thank you</p>
