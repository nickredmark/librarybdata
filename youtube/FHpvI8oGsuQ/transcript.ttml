<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:23.510" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking today with Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:27.680" style="s2">Milo is a hard man to categorize,</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:33.140" style="s2">part journalists, part performance artist,<br />part Agent Provocateur</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:36.139" style="s2">part comedian at WIPP and whit.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:40.080" style="s2">Yiannopoulos is a man of immense <br />and complex self-contradiction.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.500" end="00:00:45.020" style="s2">He&#39;s half Greek and half Irish, <br />but is known as an Englishman</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.020" end="00:00:48.560" style="s2">to the Americans with whom <br />he has communicated extensively</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">He&#39;s gay, Jewish by descent.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:58.280" style="s2">He married his long-term boyfriend <br />an African-American man in Hawaii in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:02.080" style="s2">but faces frequent accusations of racism.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:08.720" style="s2">He is or was strangely attractive <br />to young American Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.720" end="00:01:13.820" style="s2">and completed a successful <br />and controversy-ridden tour of US universities</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.820" end="00:01:15.820" style="s2">in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.420" end="00:01:21.100" style="s2">For at least two years he was one <br />of the most well known internet celebrities,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.120" end="00:01:23.540" style="s2">let&#39;s say on the political front,</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.540" end="00:01:28.100" style="s2">caused more uproar than any other <br />single person that I can think of.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.109" end="00:01:35.329" style="s2">He collected his fair share of enemies along the way he&#39;s often accused for example of being an all-right supporter an</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">accusation</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:43.099" style="s2">Justified in the view of those who opposed him by his association with Breitbart for whom he was an editor in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:46.310" style="s2">My view for what it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:53.329" style="s2">Milo was such a figure of inner contradiction and outer controversy that I believed from the beginning that his time was numbered</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:02:01.129" style="s2">Nonetheless, the circumstances of his demise were unpredictable. I would say nuts in keeping with his apparent destiny</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:08.750" style="s2">After revealing details of his early sexual experiences at the hands of a 29 year old priest who he refused to name</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:16.250" style="s2">He stated that he was an active participant in the events and that such occurrences were far more common and far more consensual</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.380" end="00:02:18.529" style="s2">than people were willing to admit I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:23.630" style="s2">Don&#39;t think he ever recovered from the controversy that those comments generated. I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:29.449" style="s2">Should finish by saying that Milo is definitely now on the list of those who no one</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:34.909" style="s2">Unacceptably socially should ever speak to which I suppose is one of the reason is why I&#39;m talking to him</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.910" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">I want to know what happened to him and his old words and I don&#39;t really give a damn if that&#39;s politically incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:45.590" style="s2">Thanks Milo for agreeing to be on my channel and podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:53.329" style="s2">Thank you very much for having me. Um, I take a slightly less fatalistic view of my prospects than your introduction would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.270" end="00:02:56.190" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.190" end="00:02:58.219" style="s2">Certainly. I went through an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:00.870" style="s2">tumble and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:08.390" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to share my thoughts about it with you. Yeah, well, let&#39;s let&#39;s start by reviewing some of your history if you wouldn&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:13.880" style="s2">Tell me tell me let&#39;s start with a bit of your history in the UK before you came to the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.880" end="00:03:19.189" style="s2">it&#39;s been long enough so that I think some biographical information would be useful for people so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.070" end="00:03:24.320" style="s2">Tell me tell me about your your life in the UK before he came to the US</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.960" end="00:03:29.150" style="s2">Then let&#39;s start talking about what happened to you as soon as you came over to North America</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">Sure, um</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:34.310" style="s2">Had a very unhappy life</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:37.250" style="s2">Particularly a very unhappy 20s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:41.930" style="s2">In London, I started out for the journalists and some quite prestigious publications</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:45.620" style="s2">I was in a relationship. That was I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:50.719" style="s2">Don&#39;t think healthy or happy for either person involved. I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:57.320" style="s2">Was searching I think I was looking I couldn&#39;t work out yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.780" end="00:04:04.100" style="s2">What I was what I was for what my purpose was and it wasn&#39;t until I got to America</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.100" end="00:04:06.100" style="s2">I discovered what it was, but I started to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:09.890" style="s2">explore at least what would eventually become my</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.890" end="00:04:12.450" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:16.369" style="s2">Suppose my civic function as bomb-thrower and provocateur</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.549" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">Right the beginning of my career in journalism. I mean, I I was fairly predictably come from a broken home</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:25.550" style="s2">Not much love for Forel from either parent</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:30.890" style="s2">And I started I got lucky combination, I guess of luck and talent</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">writing for the Telegraph which is the most prestigious newspaper in Britain and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:37.200" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.200" end="00:04:44.539" style="s2">Began to notice the gap between the world that I was being asked to describe and the world that I could see existed</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.419" end="00:04:49.319" style="s2">At the time I was writing about Sarah it was being asked to say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.650" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">Women were having a dreadful time of it in the emerging startup ecosystem in London</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:04:58.440" style="s2">Which as far as I could tell was the exact opposite of the truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.740" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">and eventually these fissures got wider and wider to the point where I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.660" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">Sort of had this this moment where I realized that my profession was a crock of you-know-what</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.240" end="00:05:18.180" style="s2">And that if I wanted to if I wanted to do something worthwhile with my life, I should either</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.850" end="00:05:22.409" style="s2">Blow it up from the inside by being one. I&#39;ll pick something else to do and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.850" end="00:05:26.830" style="s2">That was around the time that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.830" end="00:05:32.969" style="s2">Attracted the attention of Breitbart the site in the US and I started from London writing from Breitbart in the u.s. In that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.970" end="00:05:36.630" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know what it was. I never met Andrew Breitbart and I didn&#39;t know who he was either</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.730" end="00:05:44.339" style="s2">It was to begin with it&#39;s a funny thing when you look at things in retrospect, you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.310" end="00:05:46.990" style="s2">involved with</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.990" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">people in organizations that develop a particular way over time and then it looks</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.310" end="00:05:58.290" style="s2">From historical perspective like that was self-evident from the beginning, but certainly not when you&#39;re dealing with a new organization</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.200" end="00:06:04.679" style="s2">Yeah, I mean it was new ish. I don&#39;t think that the values of Breitbart changed a lot, but I think perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.860" end="00:06:10.710" style="s2">Its murderous operandi, I think perhaps the way that it conducted itself as an organization</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2">shifted into high gear</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.150" end="00:06:15.269" style="s2">When Steve Benin and I were there</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.370" end="00:06:20.130" style="s2">And I was doing the culture war stuff and Steve was using the rest of the site as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.680" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">battering ram politically</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:29.099" style="s2">So, I mean I bear a large part of the responsibility for Breitbart becoming what it eventually became</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.100" end="00:06:34.290" style="s2">Although I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve held on to that legacy very well. I think it&#39;s a little sad the way that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.470" end="00:06:39.059" style="s2">When I was there we used to make the news and now they&#39;re sort of chasing off the turning-point</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.550" end="00:06:41.880" style="s2">You know with stories that could have been written in 2015-16</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:45.870" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve managed to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.580" end="00:06:50.350" style="s2">Culturally defining</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.350" end="00:06:53.939" style="s2">Excitement that was there when I was there, which I think is a functionary in Steve working together</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.640" end="00:06:56.200" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.200" end="00:07:02.580" style="s2">Suppose my centre of gravity just started shifting to the US. I started getting speak it colleges</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.220" end="00:07:04.270" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.270" end="00:07:07.859" style="s2">Sooner or later one day. I just sort of thought there was six of them in a row</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:10.259" style="s2">So I thought was not quite flying home between them. I may as well just stay</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.900" end="00:07:14.490" style="s2">And just do sort of college after college and then suddenly I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.360" end="00:07:22.469" style="s2">Booking more of them and wondering why I should bother going home and my center of gravity editorially and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.890" end="00:07:27.240" style="s2">In you know other ways was shifting to the u.s. too. So I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:33.270" style="s2">Over the course of six or nine months began writing more at the States thinking more about the States</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.030" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">being in it talking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.390" end="00:07:39.100" style="s2">then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.100" end="00:07:42.719" style="s2">suppose fast forward a year, perhaps and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:51.749" style="s2">Was one of the two or three people driving, you know Breitbart as this extraordinary momentous</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.770" end="00:07:56.729" style="s2">Fascinating dysfunctional editorial force for the last election</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.570" end="00:08:06.390" style="s2">So, what was it that attracted you do you think to the United States and the political concerns there why away from the UK I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.450" end="00:08:09.450" style="s2">Don&#39;t think Britain</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.580" end="00:08:17.369" style="s2">Handles iconoclasts very well and it particularly doesn&#39;t handle bombastic ones and I think a lot of people with outsized</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.740" end="00:08:18.760" style="s2">personalities</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.760" end="00:08:20.760" style="s2">Find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.670" end="00:08:27.239" style="s2">Investigating America as an alternative birth because I think America has a much higher tolerance for</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.480" end="00:08:30.480" style="s2">Outside personalities. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.480" end="00:08:36.239" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s pretty clear that you had some of the characteristics that made people that make people stars</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">You know that make people personalities. It was obvious pretty much from the step</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.990" end="00:08:45.270" style="s2">This is why I&#39;m not worried in the long term about my career prospects. You know, I had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:51.689" style="s2">Stratospheric rise over a couple of years and you know a painful tumble</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.700" end="00:08:56.340" style="s2">But talent is talent and talent always wins and I&#39;ve got 40 years ahead of me</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.340" end="00:09:02.789" style="s2">You know of whatever I choose to do with it, so I&#39;m not worried in the long time about my career prospects good</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.790" end="00:09:05.219" style="s2">well, we can talk about your your descent and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.670" end="00:09:12.570" style="s2">Sort of catastrophe that accompanied it and maybe about how you see yourself pulling</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.210" end="00:09:15.210" style="s2">Yourself how you see?</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.280" end="00:09:17.919" style="s2">Being pulled out of that. I&#39;d like to hear about that as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.830" end="00:09:24.819" style="s2">So what in the world do you think made you so attractive to American Republicans?</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.820" end="00:09:25.430" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.430" end="00:09:31.210" style="s2">this is one of the things that struck me about you right from the beginning because it&#39;s not exactly like you&#39;re a poster boy for</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.060" end="00:09:34.390" style="s2">what you would assume a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.090" end="00:09:41.919" style="s2">conservative American Republicans would be attracted to so only thing they quite liked the fact that I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.710" end="00:09:48.999" style="s2">Reflecting their views in a package that you would more often think would be a liberal and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.000" end="00:09:51.880" style="s2">I you know made that part of the act and part of the brand</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.880" end="00:09:56.530" style="s2">It&#39;s kind of like, you know, all these things and yet still Republican, but the real answer is joy</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.740" end="00:10:01.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a joylessness about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.030" end="00:10:06.699" style="s2">Conservative activist authors and speakers and there&#39;s a joylessness in intellectual darkweb, too</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">It&#39;s a very fun &#39;less place</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.950" end="00:10:13.359" style="s2">and I look at I look out at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.630" end="00:10:19.780" style="s2">public intellectuals and commentators and speakers who are currently enjoying a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.050" end="00:10:26.229" style="s2">Moment in the Sun and each of them is in their own way quite. Joyless</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.870" end="00:10:30.070" style="s2">quite devoid of mirth, and I think that people liked</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:37.870" style="s2">my sense of mischief and mice and they liked the fact that I was always smiling and I think it&#39;s a I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:41.050" style="s2">Unusual to see somebody talking about really serious things</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:47.049" style="s2">who is the subject of the most extraordinary and relentless abuse who nonetheless is always smiling and I</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.330" end="00:12:40.210" style="s2">Scores on neuroticism. It&#39;s like you were you were subject to a tremendous amount of controversy and and then</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.770" end="00:12:52.030" style="s2">you seemed to be able to survive that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.610" end="00:12:58.479" style="s2">You just described yourself as a relatively. Joyful person. I mean, I&#39;m a very happy person. I think that</p>

<p begin="00:17:07.170" end="00:17:12.929" style="s2">Some people are devastated by the smallest of obstacles and some people can roll with punches</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:02.970" style="s2">the reason I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.100" end="00:18:06.959" style="s2">Kind of a trickster, you know, I mean, I think that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:13.970" style="s2">That that you do there is a game-like element to what you&#39;re doing and and I very much see what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.460" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">In life and will be doing for the next 40 years as playing a very complex and very enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.560" end="00:18:23.060" style="s2">game of and very, you know a game of snakes and ladders and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.970" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">just because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:30.499" style="s2">Hit a ladder on one of my first turns and then immediately the snake took me back to the front row</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t mean the game is over</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:34.639" style="s2">You know, in fact it just means you you&#39;ve learned the rules</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.220" end="00:18:37.050" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.050" end="00:18:40.999" style="s2">That&#39;s I suppose why I find it difficult to take too. Seriously, you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.690" end="00:18:47.690" style="s2">Harrowing introspection about you know, whatever because it just that&#39;s not how I pretend the situation</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.690" end="00:18:52.460" style="s2">I can look dispassionately what happened and why and we can talk about that and I have some ideas about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.810" end="00:18:56.810" style="s2">But I</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">Don&#39;t have a I</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.340" end="00:19:03.529" style="s2">Don&#39;t have a sort of emotional. I don&#39;t have anything to offload about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.230" end="00:19:10.759" style="s2">Really? Okay. Okay what so you know when when that conversation about your</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.400" end="00:19:16.790" style="s2">early childhood sexual experiences first came out I listened to it and I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.850" end="00:19:20.600" style="s2">There was tremendous trouble brewing there, you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.510" end="00:19:24.350" style="s2">for a variety of reasons and if you remember I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.630" end="00:19:32.270" style="s2">Phoned you at that point and suggested that we had a conversation and we made some efforts to manage that that never came to fruition</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.940" end="00:19:40.399" style="s2">And I always felt that that was unfortunate. And so I&#39;d like to if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d like to ask you about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.250" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">situation because</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:47.149" style="s2">You know, I had a lot of mixed feelings about what you said. I</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">like many people and they weren&#39;t particularly judgmental, by the way, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.070" end="00:19:54.300" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.300" end="00:19:58.220" style="s2">You didn&#39;t you correct me if I&#39;m wrong here because I want to get this story straight</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.950" end="00:20:05.659" style="s2">Mmm-hmm you related some experiences you had with a priest who is twice your age, right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.510" end="00:20:10.999" style="s2">Something like that. Yeah approximating approximately doubt. You were about 14. I</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.330" end="00:20:14.330" style="s2">Think it was a little older than that actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:19.429" style="s2">Okay, okay. It&#39;s difficult to judge ages when you are 14</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:23.899" style="s2">I think I thought I think I thought that he was younger than he was at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.420" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">Subsequently found out he was perhaps 10 years older than I thought he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.430" end="00:20:39.110" style="s2">And so arguably he was someone who is in a position of authority and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:44.569" style="s2">What he did with you was something that he shouldn&#39;t have done and also</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.940" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">It&#39;s highly probable given the nature of such things that you were by no means his only let&#39;s say target</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.350" end="00:20:59.959" style="s2">hmm now when I heard you talk about that the first thing that struck me about the way that you formulated it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.660" end="00:21:02.779" style="s2">your refusal to play victim</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:06.169" style="s2">Not actually funded see myself as one</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.170" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">I know. I know I know that I know that and that actually struck me as rather admirable because you came forward and said</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.090" end="00:21:17.390" style="s2">This is an uncomfortable truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.390" end="00:21:18.230" style="s2">But you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.230" end="00:21:24.589" style="s2">I was of sufficient age to have a mind of my own and this was something I was pursuing of my own volition</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:30.169" style="s2">And then it&#39;s how I felt at the time and you talked about the the abuse of authority or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.350" end="00:21:35.659" style="s2">I&#39;ve never met an authority. I recognized or respect, you know, people have to earn my respect</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.820" end="00:21:41.720" style="s2">I have never encountered a person in a position of responsibility or authority who I have respected and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.900" end="00:21:46.550" style="s2">And deferred to merely by virtue of their office or their position. I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.070" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">Just I sort of constitutionally don&#39;t recognize Authority. So it that element of it did not strike me until someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.800" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">Because I don&#39;t imagine that you were much different in some sense when you were 14 then you are now</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:06.350" style="s2">You know apart from obvious motivation</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.560" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:14.059" style="s2">Assertive and provocative person and you&#39;re an icon of class and I can certainly see that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.940" end="00:22:19.909" style="s2">That intrinsic respect for authority which so oddly often characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.310" end="00:22:27.890" style="s2">conservatives by the way is quite absent in you and so and I thought that given it because we have it as the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.200" end="00:22:30.120" style="s2">tabloid gadfly</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.120" end="00:22:32.120" style="s2">constantly taking potshots at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.940" end="00:22:37.249" style="s2">institutions that also secretly loved and are grateful for but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.509" style="s2">are dedicated to keeping them on the ground and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.030" end="00:22:44.030" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.280" end="00:22:49.129" style="s2">You know the the British tabloids which love to torment our Prime Minister and the White House</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.290" end="00:22:53.569" style="s2">Correspondents Dinner where journalists are seeking to participate in that prestige</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.150" end="00:22:56.150" style="s2">rather then</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:23:01.579" style="s2">Bring these people down to earth and make sure they never go a full day taking themselves too. Seriously</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.540" end="00:23:07.819" style="s2">So I think I think that&#39;s a perhaps a british. It&#39;s a bit of british a bit of the british psyche</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.820" end="00:23:10.220" style="s2">well, no, that seems given my</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.130" end="00:23:16.189" style="s2">Interactions with British journalists, that seems like a perfectly appropriate statement now</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:21.229" style="s2">despite the fact that when I heard you speak about what happened to you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.020" end="00:23:23.730" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.730" end="00:23:29.270" style="s2">Admiration for your refusal to play innocent victim. I also had</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.030" end="00:23:31.530" style="s2">contradictory ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.530" end="00:23:35.449" style="s2">that I think were more a function of my clinical training and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">There were two of them that I&#39;d like to discuss with you. I mean the first is</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:49.969" style="s2">You know when you think about yourself as a 14 year old you think about that 14 year old as it as yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.970" end="00:23:54.290" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily think about that 14 year old as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.450" end="00:23:55.710" style="s2">14 year old and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.710" end="00:24:01.250" style="s2">You know when you remember your 14 year old self and then you go out and you see some 14 year olds</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.290" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">it&#39;s actually quite a shock or it can be quite a shock because</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.590" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">14 year olds are often a lot younger and a lot more clueless than you. Are you?</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:14.899" style="s2">yeah, then you remember yourself being you know, I think I know where you&#39;re going with this and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.100" end="00:24:18.919" style="s2">Well in Seoul, so good good</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.919" end="00:24:19.340" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.340" end="00:24:22.250" style="s2">cuz the second part of what I thought was that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.679" end="00:24:27.769" style="s2">It and and this is this the incredibly tricky part of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.290" end="00:24:32.359" style="s2">As far as I&#39;m concerned, I mean one of the other things that got you in real trouble</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.299" end="00:24:35.299" style="s2">Apart from the fact that you wouldn&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.850" end="00:24:37.169" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.169" end="00:24:43.549" style="s2">the person that you interacted with your abuser, so to speak was that you made the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.280" end="00:24:48.349" style="s2">Unforgiveable case I think publicly the this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.750" end="00:24:55.729" style="s2">happened far more commonly than people were willing to admit and I just as soon as you said that I thought man you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:25:02.030" style="s2">You&#39;re dead in the water because it was interesting. What do you mean good? Well true that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.030" end="00:25:07.129" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s not something that can be publicly discussed. It&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.920" end="00:25:09.920" style="s2">You know in it</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.990" end="00:25:16.940" style="s2">okay, I went a bit further than just that I took it I took it a step further even and said that not only is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.940" end="00:25:23.929" style="s2">This something that happens far more often than people are willing to admit it is a function of gay life and gay</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.030" end="00:25:29.030" style="s2">Adolescence flossing whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.310" end="00:25:33.649" style="s2">It is a proper subject for humor. And I insist on it being a promise. Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.650" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:37.640" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t even gonna bring those two things up because I thought that just you know that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.920" end="00:25:42.019" style="s2">Merely bringing up the first part of that because enough trouble, but I&#39;m glad that you did</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.050" end="00:25:48.680" style="s2">well because there&#39;s a serious conversation that has to be had about this and the damn conversation hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:51.500" style="s2">happened and I don&#39;t mean specifically about</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.230" end="00:25:57.439" style="s2">Even specifically about your particular experience, although I think it&#39;s a way into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.140" end="00:26:01.369" style="s2">It&#39;s like the first question is well</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.370" end="00:26:03.709" style="s2">It&#39;d be it&#39;d be interesting to take apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.780" end="00:26:08.569" style="s2">Some of your claims and I&#39;d like to do that with your permission and I don&#39;t expect this to be an easy conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.420" end="00:26:14.599" style="s2">Notice, I wasn&#39;t expecting to be so go ahead. Okay? Okay. So the first thing I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.860" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">It isn&#39;t obvious to me that even if you were a willing participant in what happened to you when you were 14</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.840" end="00:26:26.820" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">Justifies what happened to you on the part of the person with whom you were participating?</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.110" end="00:26:38.569" style="s2">Well, of course, it doesn&#39;t but the way I have pretended it was that it was me</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.450" end="00:26:40.500" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.500" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">But but and and and when I said a moment ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:48.709" style="s2">I think I know where you&#39;re going with this. I can interject with a very small data point that I think explains</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:57.920" style="s2">How I think about this after some time and reflection which is I have something now that I didn&#39;t have in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.920" end="00:27:00.259" style="s2">Which is a relationship with my stepson</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">He is 16 and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.220" end="00:27:10.220" style="s2">When I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:12.539" style="s2">Let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.539" end="00:27:17.629" style="s2">Let&#39;s not finish that thought. But when I consider how old he is and put myself at that age</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.419" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">Suddenly the horror</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:24.739" style="s2">but I see in everybody else&#39;s faces that I have never felt myself about what happens in me and metal has never</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.110" end="00:27:32.270" style="s2">been has never been communicated from me a sort of acknowledgment and awareness that this is not normal and that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.390" end="00:27:36.859" style="s2">Horrifying and terrible thing that happens to a small person</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.890" end="00:27:41.509" style="s2">I never apprehended it like that because I just thought of that 14-year old as me today, right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:44.730" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.730" end="00:27:51.409" style="s2">what I picked up from your from your entities until the last two years and now I&#39;m and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.830" end="00:27:56.659" style="s2">Experiencing getting to know a child. Yeah as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:00.169" style="s2">co-parent yes stepmom and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.840" end="00:28:02.460" style="s2">Now I get it</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.460" end="00:28:09.770" style="s2">Okay. Okay. All right. So, you know, I&#39;ve seen this with my clinical clients, you know, who who</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.309" end="00:28:16.069" style="s2">Failed to notice in some important way that the person they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:23.479" style="s2">sometimes decades ago is not the person they are now and the memories they have from those times which are</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.970" end="00:28:30.049" style="s2">Appropriate to those times are not the same memories that are appropriate to those times now</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.510" end="00:28:35.539" style="s2">given their relative maturation as we understand and I think it took that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.049" end="00:28:38.549" style="s2">That</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.549" end="00:28:42.709" style="s2">Change in my life circumstances for me to jump me into realizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">Exactly what you&#39;re saying? Okay, so let&#39;s so let me ask you some questions about that. So</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.429" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">What?</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.019" style="s2">What&#39;s changed in the way that you view? What happened to you?</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.020" end="00:28:58.789" style="s2">And if you were interviewed well</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.789" end="00:29:06.169" style="s2">And I guess you are being interviewed about this right now if you were being interviewed about what happened to you at age 14</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.169" end="00:29:08.869" style="s2">I have two questions or three questions about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.809" end="00:29:14.599" style="s2">What do you think of the propriety of that? How do you now view your role?</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.749" end="00:29:21.649" style="s2">What do you think about the culpability of the person that that I would say in?</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.590" end="00:29:26.929" style="s2">Common parlance preyed upon you how is that shifted?</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.019" end="00:29:34.849" style="s2">In the same way that there is a although it has been ruined by the progressives. We both hate so much a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.610" end="00:29:37.610" style="s2">proper place for outrage</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:40.998" style="s2">It is unnecessary and right</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.809" end="00:29:45.768" style="s2">Human instinct and emotion that has a place there</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.529" end="00:29:48.529" style="s2">is also perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.840" end="00:29:52.340" style="s2">much as it has been ruined by the progressives a proper place for</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.070" end="00:29:56.419" style="s2">Victimhood when you are in fact actually a victim, right?</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.419" end="00:30:02.689" style="s2">And I think that now I perhaps realized that I was one when I didn&#39;t know that I was one in 2017. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.690" end="00:30:06.440" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a hell of a thing for someone in your position taking it, right?</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.649" end="00:30:14.839" style="s2">It&#39;s rough man. And I and I think that that&#39;s as concise and it&#39;s true. No sir as I can give you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.710" end="00:30:24.259" style="s2">Now I look at somebody I care about who is two years older even</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.049" end="00:30:28.788" style="s2">And the thought of me at that age and someone taking advantage</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.700" end="00:30:35.090" style="s2">Suddenly I get it. I get it. I&#39;m like I would kill the guy I would walk over there</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.090" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">I would shoot him in the head</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">Like I get it now</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.879" end="00:30:44.449" style="s2">Didn&#39;t get it when I was I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.409" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">Didn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:51.439" style="s2">When all I had to go on was my memories of being me at the time. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.809" end="00:30:52.309" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.309" end="00:30:54.149" style="s2">what are the things that struck me is so</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.149" end="00:30:58.579" style="s2">absolutely absurd about what happened to you in the aftermath of that interview was that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.100" end="00:31:06.860" style="s2">Okay, this is really and it&#39;s exactly what I would have expected to happen to someone like you because you&#39;re so contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.860" end="00:31:08.860" style="s2">Is that is?</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.999" end="00:31:12.319" style="s2">That you actually had a claim to victim status</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.409" end="00:31:15.739" style="s2">Which you then refused to capitalize on</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.590" end="00:31:19.279" style="s2">And then which people refused to bloody well</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.470" end="00:31:24.769" style="s2">recognized in the midst of the interview like the proper response to that interview should have been something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.409" end="00:31:32.019" style="s2">Well, here&#39;s someone who&#39;s talking about a case of child sexual abuse, but it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.540" end="00:31:35.499" style="s2">realized or recognized that they were in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.440" end="00:31:42.760" style="s2">Victimized in that situation and hasn&#39;t come to terms with whatever that might mean and this is not uncommon</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.190" end="00:31:49.570" style="s2">Among people who have been through these experiences because I have since writing about this. I wrote a little bit about this in</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.420" end="00:31:53.590" style="s2">An in a short book I read about cope recently</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.230" end="00:31:56.290" style="s2">and and in other things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.110" end="00:31:59.620" style="s2">the brief mentions I&#39;ve made of it since</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">2017 a lot of people have written to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.810" end="00:32:04.490" style="s2">with their own</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.490" end="00:32:08.199" style="s2">accounts and it&#39;s not uncommon I have</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.680" end="00:32:15.610" style="s2">Not who have experienced this sort of thing, and I guess there&#39;s some point in middle age with a penny trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.580" end="00:32:19.510" style="s2">But yeah, I guess that I guess you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.510" end="00:32:25.150" style="s2">There is there is a right and proper place to acknowledge and understand that you were a victim of something again. I have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:29.770" style="s2">Another thing that upset people. I think another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.010" end="00:32:35.469" style="s2">Didn&#39;t do many favors, but look, I I am someone who will always</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.980" end="00:32:41.530" style="s2">Just speak it as I see it and that will have terrible consequences and all have great</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.720" end="00:32:46.780" style="s2">consequences in there and that calculus will change over the course the next few decades, but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.460" end="00:32:51.460" style="s2">Just</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.980" end="00:32:56.380" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t the worst thing that ever happened to me and people find that a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:02.110" style="s2">terrible thing to come out of your mouth, but it just wasn&#39;t it&#39;s not the worst thing that&#39;s ever happened to me and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.210" end="00:33:08.980" style="s2">Okay, so I got a couple of comments on that I mean both</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.890" end="00:33:14.979" style="s2">20 years ago the American Psychological Association published a famous paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.920" end="00:33:17.420" style="s2">showing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.420" end="00:33:20.230" style="s2">Most people who were sexually abused as children</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.160" end="00:33:29.079" style="s2">Recovered with very little psychological damage and that caused absolute outrage the US Congress in fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.510" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">Forced the APA if I remember correctly the american psychological assistance</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.800" end="00:33:37.810" style="s2">Able Truths, isn&#39;t it? We track they had to retract the article even</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.540" end="00:33:41.909" style="s2">Imagine sort of trauma that we were expected to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.790" end="00:33:49.769" style="s2">That someone says they experienced because of mean words on the Internet and and we have this and we have this economy based on</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.070" end="00:33:58.200" style="s2">What we all know is not true, but that you know, these trivial frivolous things can cause some kind of actual trauma</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.780" end="00:34:05.249" style="s2">For an organization like that or for someone in public life to come out and say this huge thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.430" end="00:34:08.519" style="s2">Actually didn&#39;t cause me that much trauma</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.580" end="00:34:15.360" style="s2">It sort of imperils the whole victimhood economy, doesn&#39;t it? Because if it&#39;s the case that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.330" end="00:34:23.279" style="s2">many or even most people who experience this simply don&#39;t have their lives ruined and defined by it that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.490" end="00:34:27.600" style="s2">rather imperils the people who have made a career out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.600" end="00:34:31.949" style="s2">squawking victimhood for far far less serious</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.890" end="00:34:35.849" style="s2">experiences and I think that&#39;s probably where</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.210" end="00:34:40.020" style="s2">the threat to the system kicked in I</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.110" end="00:34:47.579" style="s2">Think that&#39;s true. I think it&#39;s also the case that the politicians although also looking for a you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.580" end="00:34:53.069" style="s2">A cheap victory moral victory in some sense. We&#39;re also concerned that this was a potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.430" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">step towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:34:58.890" style="s2">justifying pedophilia on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.770" end="00:35:02.280" style="s2">Undermining the claims of it&#39;s absolutely catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.920" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">consequences over</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:10.260" style="s2">Decades, whereas what? I saw it was was more as a testament to the fundamental resilience of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.380" end="00:35:17.549" style="s2">It isn&#39;t isn&#39;t that a positive thing. Isn&#39;t that wonderful news that there is there there are these extraordinarily evil people</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.550" end="00:35:20.039" style="s2">who do depraved things but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:21.810" style="s2">Chances are you&#39;ll be all right?</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.810" end="00:35:26.459" style="s2">You know, then something like this could happen to or could happen to somebody you love or somebody, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.890" end="00:35:33.029" style="s2">but that you know what chances are things will be okay now every once in a while somebody is just</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:40.350" style="s2">Blown apart by it and you can never put them back together, but that&#39;s not most people that&#39;s fabulous news</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.390" end="00:35:44.009" style="s2">but good news is the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.950" end="00:35:49.890" style="s2">our current political climate the public square in America, especially hates</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.740" end="00:35:52.740" style="s2">It&#39;s not so much with</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.050" end="00:35:56.310" style="s2">It&#39;s a particular kind of reaction to for instance</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.869" end="00:36:00.869" style="s2">People being people being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:06.659" style="s2">Grateful and happy at the capitalism is you know lifting millions of people out of poverty all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:08.660" style="s2">You wouldn&#39;t like that good news</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:13.770" style="s2">Because much of what goes on in public life</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.290" end="00:36:18.300" style="s2">Basically the whole journalism industry much of the entertainment industry</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.300" end="00:36:23.909" style="s2">I mean that the hope the whole of polite society the whole of political politically correct society depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">Everything being terrible</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:33.929" style="s2">imperil getting worse all the time the sort of shrieking urgent hysteria of the press is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.650" end="00:36:41.190" style="s2">Made to look ridiculous when you point out actually the world&#39;s pretty great. Not that people not how many people go hungry</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.099" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">Not that much bad stuff happens the bad stuff that does happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:49.199" style="s2">We&#39;re discovering all the time that human beings bounce back in ways that you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.349" style="s2">We&#39;ve never never even imagined the world ain&#39;t that bloody bad?</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.930" end="00:36:55.109" style="s2">Nobody wants to hear that who has invested in</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.510" end="00:37:05.699" style="s2">It at least it&#39;s nowhere near as bad as it once was which is something or as bad as bad as it profits</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.190" end="00:37:13.050" style="s2">the media to suggest that it is is that profits the Academy just suggests that it is, you know it these people these people</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.810" end="00:37:15.810" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.030" end="00:37:18.269" style="s2">Having relinquished their primary phone</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.109" end="00:37:22.679" style="s2">Whether it is, you know speaking truth to power and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.619" end="00:37:27.779" style="s2">you know printing all the news that&#39;s you know, relaying the news is for to print or</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.790" end="00:37:40.109" style="s2">Expanding that you know that the horizons and the sum total of human knowledge the media and the Academy given up on those missions</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.660" end="00:37:45.869" style="s2">Instead replace them with an activism that depends on hysteria, but also on urgency</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.660" end="00:37:48.490" style="s2">on a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.490" end="00:37:49.930" style="s2">sort of constant drumbeat</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.930" end="00:37:51.390" style="s2">This is why you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.390" end="00:37:56.220" style="s2">It&#39;s always something you always something you always something new as soon as something might look like it&#39;s resolved something</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:37:58.919" style="s2">evermore hysterical and new must be produced</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.930" end="00:38:03.750" style="s2">This is this I mean this is the natural life cycle isn&#39;t it of rights movements do the gay rights movement?</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.750" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">which basically achieves everything it&#39;ll possibly want yet it somehow becomes more hysterical not less and starts focusing on ever more minor and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.650" end="00:38:14.520" style="s2">insignificant things like transgender pronouns rather than AIDS</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.250" end="00:38:19.379" style="s2">you know, and now all of the gay charities are run by lesbians and are preoccupied with</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.260" end="00:38:23.549" style="s2">Transgender pronouns. You don&#39;t hear anybody talking about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.430" end="00:38:26.109" style="s2">thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.109" end="00:38:28.109" style="s2">these posters on New York</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.660" end="00:38:33.149" style="s2">trams on the subway or whatever they&#39;re called and they and they&#39;re saying um</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.089" end="00:38:41.639" style="s2">There&#39;s a guy there and he&#39;s called Hernandez or Hernando whatever and his and the poster is saying his levels of HIV</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.640" end="00:38:45.240" style="s2">Thanks to his medication aren&#39;t just undetectable. They&#39;re not transmittable either</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.150" end="00:38:50.849" style="s2">Basically, encouraging gay men to have sex with hiv-positive other. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.849" end="00:38:55.739" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s kind of like sick do but this is because conservatives have completely stepped out of that sphere entirely</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.990" end="00:38:59.129" style="s2">Every time a conservative tries to say something in the gay world</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.170" end="00:39:05.879" style="s2">Even if it&#39;s with good intentions to help they get killed, so gay so Republicans and even lose all sensible</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.880" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">People have simply stepped out of LGBT stuff and they just don&#39;t get involved in it at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.690" end="00:39:13.289" style="s2">So you get this sick crazy like men</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.390" end="00:39:20.339" style="s2">So with this to this situation where they&#39;re encouraging these reckless unsafe horrendous behaviors and who suffers</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.670" end="00:39:23.940" style="s2">The most marginalized communities of all is that you know?</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.940" end="00:39:29.879" style="s2">Is it so so gay black Americans have like a one in two chance of getting HIV, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.250" end="00:39:31.529" style="s2">Like that&#39;s that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.529" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">And this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:37.890" style="s2">And this is this is this is what gay charities are not talking about while they are insisting that you know on</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.529" end="00:39:44.009" style="s2">Diseases and whatever this is this is the life cycle of rights movements when they run out of things to complain about</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.670" end="00:39:49.349" style="s2">Okay, so let me let me ask you another personal question</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.670" end="00:39:56.909" style="s2">Before I turn to something that will probably get me even more trouble in more trouble</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.520" end="00:40:01.770" style="s2">We&#39;ll see. We&#39;ll see how that goes. We&#39;ve subjected me to a therapy session</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.770" end="00:40:07.679" style="s2">I think you can you can you can even get yourself into trouble as as compensation. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:12.180" style="s2">Well, there should be plenty of trouble emerge from this so well Laura now</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.569" end="00:40:18.569" style="s2">one of the questions I had again as a consequence of watching that interview was because</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.340" end="00:40:26.749" style="s2">You portrayed yourself as an equivalent partner in some sense, and I thought look that means that Milo hasn&#39;t updated his memories</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.690" end="00:40:33.560" style="s2">there&#39;s still the memories of a 14 year old and that that&#39;s a problem and and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:38.509" style="s2">And so and you said that that&#39;s something that you&#39;ve actually rectified over the last couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.510" end="00:40:43.820" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s a very interesting thing to hear about but then I was also</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.210" end="00:40:46.230" style="s2">convinced</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.230" end="00:40:52.520" style="s2">that because you were still viewing what had happened to you through the lens of your 14 year old your</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.130" end="00:40:55.759" style="s2">iconoclastic and rebellious 14 year old self</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.490" end="00:40:58.520" style="s2">That it was possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.490" end="00:41:01.020" style="s2">likely even</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.020" end="00:41:03.800" style="s2">although not necessarily the case that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.380" end="00:41:08.779" style="s2">Underestimated the consequence of this interaction on your subsequent life</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.940" end="00:41:15.770" style="s2">And so now you just told me that you know worse things have happened to you. Yes in 20. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.770" end="00:41:18.770" style="s2">Yeah, you might be right about that because in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.960" end="00:41:23.210" style="s2">That&#39;s what I thought and then in the course of writing the short pope book</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.210" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">I just did I asked the question could this have affected the trajectory of my sexuality?</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.400" end="00:41:31.400" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.550" end="00:41:39.380" style="s2">So what in retrospect now now what do you think what do you think it did you I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.860" end="00:41:46.729" style="s2">Don&#39;t think it made the difference between me being gay or not. Okay, and why not?</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.690" end="00:41:54.890" style="s2">Because I think that that was already happening and I think that I was aware of that and that that was very much</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.860" end="00:42:01.309" style="s2">You know some gay people talk about, you know, being a little bit over into gay or a lot or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.310" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">you know some some gay men can can</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.900" end="00:42:06.379" style="s2">countenance or imagine having sex with women</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.320" end="00:42:13.249" style="s2">And first for others, it&#39;s just like yeah, you know in the way that straight men will talk about homosexual encounters</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.010" end="00:42:20.209" style="s2">now I have had a few encounters with women, but they were very unsatisfying and miserable for both parties and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.090" end="00:42:22.110" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.110" end="00:42:27.259" style="s2">Think I&#39;m quite I don&#39;t I don&#39;t my hunch is and I can&#39;t provide any evidence with my hunches</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.720" end="00:42:29.720" style="s2">That this did not make the difference</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.030" end="00:42:32.030" style="s2">Okay, I think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.590" end="00:42:39.400" style="s2">Like everybody the mixture of nature and nurture in my case was probably swung over in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.410" end="00:42:42.609" style="s2">But I like a good male male role models and my relationship with my mother</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.580" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">distinctly remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.000" end="00:42:49.000" style="s2">picking</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.230" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">Ethnic minority male sexual partners and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.550" end="00:43:00.699" style="s2">Making sure that my mother saw me bring them home or saw me out with them to antagonize her. I</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.490" end="00:43:07.870" style="s2">distinctly remember picking sexual partners to annoy my mom and that as demented as that sounds and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.630" end="00:43:15.910" style="s2">God, that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s a Chris. I mean like a three-hour conversation. No, I&#39;m look I take trolling very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.650" end="00:43:20.650" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.660" end="00:43:24.849" style="s2">Just I&#39;m not saying I went to my mom although I have made that joke</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">but I remember an element of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.340" end="00:43:36.130" style="s2">Mischief and defiance in there which has always been at the core of my personality. Just this is this reflexive and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:41.260" style="s2">Unshakable refusal to bow to any kind of authority</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.510" end="00:43:46.390" style="s2">But not just a thumb my nose at it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.390" end="00:43:52.269" style="s2">But to rub that authority&#39;s face in whatever it is of that Authority finds most repugnant, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.940" end="00:43:54.350" style="s2">interesting, so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.350" end="00:43:56.799" style="s2">first question there would be perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:00.040" style="s2">What in the world were you so?</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.070" end="00:44:07.239" style="s2">Irritated or angry at your mother about that that might have been one of your potential reactions. I</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:16.719" style="s2">Have said this in public before so I don&#39;t mind sharing it with you. Can my mother remarried and her new husband was?</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.030" end="00:44:22.030" style="s2">Occasionally physically and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.040" end="00:44:26.529" style="s2">Constantly psychologically abusive, I guess where is the word that we would use now?</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.470" end="00:44:29.470" style="s2">deep a deeply unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:35.560" style="s2">home life in things like so I was a very private kid and I had all of these like</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.950" end="00:44:39.970" style="s2">papers where I had written out poems and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">Constructed these like systems and I just said I just had a very developed in a world, you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:47.190" style="s2">and I&#39;ve just lived in the realm of imagination and fantasy and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.050" end="00:44:55.709" style="s2">Private space and privacy was very important to me and my mother&#39;s new husband when I was at school would go into my room and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.710" end="00:44:59.790" style="s2">Shuffle things around just so that I knew he&#39;d been in there. So I knew that there was no space</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.790" end="00:45:06.060" style="s2">that was only mine and I knew by extension that I wasn&#39;t welcome there and that I shouldn&#39;t be there and as long as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.060" end="00:45:09.629" style="s2">Was under his roof. I would never be at my own human being and I would never have my own</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.510" end="00:45:15.209" style="s2">Privacy and therefore autonomy as a human being and I blamed my mother for this</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.210" end="00:45:20.339" style="s2">I also blamed my mother for not leaving him when he hit me</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.220" end="00:45:24.750" style="s2">And I blamed my father for not taking me away</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.750" end="00:45:31.199" style="s2">Although I asked him to and that sort of began a chain reaction of resentment for both of them. Right? It&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:36.149" style="s2">so most of the major authority figures in your life as parental figures had</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.510" end="00:45:40.949" style="s2">your experience at that point was of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:43.859" style="s2">betrayal of various neg of may</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.530" end="00:45:50.909" style="s2">Various magnitudes, right? Yes. I did. They didn&#39;t have my back right it from from from proper betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.820" end="00:45:53.530" style="s2">all the way down to just</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.530" end="00:45:59.459" style="s2">Not having my best interests at heart not having my back and and you know all manner of experiences on that spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.830" end="00:46:01.830" style="s2">But I didn&#39;t think I ever felt</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.050" end="00:46:03.070" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.070" end="00:46:07.590" style="s2">My mother would go to the wall for me. You know, right? That&#39;s yeah, that&#39;s rough man</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.860" end="00:46:13.020" style="s2">because one of the things you really want from at least one parent or at least one person in your life is the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:15.700" style="s2">Fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.700" end="00:46:19.679" style="s2">Man, you got to have someone who start your back so I did get it later</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:24.149" style="s2">I did get it later in my mid to late teens with my grandmother as</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.940" end="00:46:26.860" style="s2">so many</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.860" end="00:46:28.860" style="s2">Oddballs, do they end up skipping a generation?</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.530" end="00:46:32.909" style="s2">And and forming a close bond with a grandparent</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.400" end="00:46:37.980" style="s2">I did get it from my grandmother and I got the sort of unconditional love and support that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.980" end="00:46:41.309" style="s2">recognized again in the man that I&#39;ve met with</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.730" end="00:46:47.429" style="s2">So I have had that since in my life and I&#39;m not wanting for it. I don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.430" end="00:46:53.129" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy with the amount of it that I now have but it didn&#39;t I made up for it in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.130" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">Oh for sure. Oh for sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.930" end="00:46:59.349" style="s2">Well, I didn&#39;t but I didn&#39;t have it at the time. Mhm and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.109" end="00:47:03.009" style="s2">I do remember really wanting to hurt I</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.859" end="00:47:06.279" style="s2">remember and I think one of my</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:09.879" style="s2">in addition to my ability to sort of see round corners and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.280" end="00:47:14.979" style="s2">Culturally and sort of tell what&#39;s coming next which I&#39;m very good at. I&#39;m also very good</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.760" end="00:47:21.310" style="s2">I&#39;m very good as sort of intuitively figuring out what makes people tick and what drives them</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.710" end="00:47:27.490" style="s2">and I quickly identified that social justice warriors were sort of hurting and wanting everyone else to hurt like they were</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.670" end="00:47:32.170" style="s2">When I when I very very first started doing my speeches</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:35.180" style="s2">Because it was something I had felt myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.180" end="00:47:40.119" style="s2">But only as a child I had grown out of it and clearly they had not grown out of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.490" end="00:47:46.389" style="s2">But I saw in them that same sort of petty vengeful vindictive desire to make the world burn</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.060" end="00:47:51.189" style="s2">because they were hurting that I had felt myself as a 13 14 15 year old and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.619" end="00:47:58.209" style="s2">So I understood them and that&#39;s why I was able and still am able like nobody else to get under their skin</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.609" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">because I get what makes them tick in a way that not many other people do because</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.079" end="00:48:07.329" style="s2">none of the other conservatives who are sort of, you know withering of you know, or</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.210" end="00:48:14.530" style="s2">Contemptuous of them actually understand where they&#39;re coming from like I do which is why they hate me like they hate nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.319" end="00:48:19.719" style="s2">Right. Well because part of the thing that&#39;s so strange about you. Is that by all rights?</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.720" end="00:48:23.199" style="s2">You should be on their side. I should be one of them. Really I</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.810" end="00:48:27.009" style="s2">Want to be great, right? That&#39;s their depth. That&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.589" end="00:48:30.399" style="s2">Logically speaking. That would be your natural resting place</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.589" end="00:48:35.979" style="s2">And so it is one of the things that well I also thought thought right from the beginning that that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.980" end="00:48:37.980" style="s2">That put you in in terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.839" end="00:48:43.389" style="s2">long-term danger of you know, encountering a scandal that would do you in I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.390" end="00:48:47.020" style="s2">It just seems so improbable to me that you could weather</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.450" end="00:48:53.409" style="s2">That degree of and now that&#39;s what I mean by the the paradoxical combination that you bring to the situation</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.510" end="00:48:57.969" style="s2">It&#39;s just it&#39;s too many contradictory things to maintain themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.970" end="00:49:05.770" style="s2">Regardless of your psychological integration or lack thereof. I mean, I think I&#39;m pretty well adjusted now, but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.349" end="00:49:11.819" style="s2">think perhaps another reason that this career just doesn&#39;t bother me is that I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.760" end="00:49:17.849" style="s2">Don&#39;t work in the same economy that a lot of other people do in the prestige economy</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.910" end="00:49:23.730" style="s2">You wanted prestige when you asked Cambridge for that fellowship and and you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.190" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">invited that little embarrassment on yourself because you asked for it because although you declared</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.180" end="00:49:38.849" style="s2">If you didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t but you declared war on a class of institution, you know a higher education to then</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:45.869" style="s2">Ask for or expect or be pleased to receive baubles from</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.570" end="00:49:50.099" style="s2">institutions that you had declared war on struck me as very odd and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.890" end="00:49:53.609" style="s2">Obviously destined for you know a mess</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting point because</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:01.769" style="s2">Moment of like false optimism. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s false optimism</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.770" end="00:50:06.570" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s because you still live in the prestige economy because I think that stuff matters to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.850" end="00:50:12.060" style="s2">and I think that you&#39;d probably prefer to see these institutions fixed and to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.580" end="00:50:17.789" style="s2">prestigious place within one of them rather than to see them burnt to the ground as so many conservatives and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.310" end="00:50:19.510" style="s2">progressives</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.510" end="00:50:23.129" style="s2">Seem to want they just want to tear up higher education. I don&#39;t think you want that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.130" end="00:50:25.260" style="s2">I think you want to fix it, and I think you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.140" end="00:50:28.140" style="s2">Generally speaking, you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.780" end="00:50:32.249" style="s2">That fixing things is better than burning them to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.250" end="00:50:36.060" style="s2">I think you want to fix them and I think you want to be one of the crown jewels</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.060" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">And I think you operate in the prestige economy in a way that I simply don&#39;t and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:43.260" style="s2">gives me power because I</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.960" end="00:50:48.810" style="s2">Don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t you know, that that&#39;s sort of like a scandal from which you will not recover</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.300" end="00:50:53.639" style="s2">Is there somebody in polite society who will invite me to a dinner party?</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">Who won&#39;t invite me to join a party now who would have in January 2017</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.800" end="00:51:02.489" style="s2">No, is there a TV show that will have me on?</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:08.609" style="s2">That won&#39;t have me on now that would have in January and Jennifer&#39;s of you know, I mean, I you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.610" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">I had a bullet on Bill Maher because of the the college tour</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.270" end="00:51:19.499" style="s2">I was ever gonna get a TV show or anything like that because unlike you I can&#39;t bite my tongue</p>

<p begin="00:54:01.510" end="00:54:07.379" style="s2">Up to the point. You cannot bear it any longer and then you crush it and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.980" end="00:54:10.980" style="s2">Horrifying warning to others</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.290" end="00:54:14.009" style="s2">Not to overstep so they did it with me</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.040" end="00:54:17.699" style="s2">they let me get as far as Bill Maher and the tour and all the rest of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.220" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">They came through there letting you climb higher</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.180" end="00:54:25.349" style="s2">So your fall is going to be just like mine was and I&#39;ll get you on something else</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.140" end="00:54:32.040" style="s2">They&#39;ll guess you want they&#39;ll get you want a complete nothing burger because mine let&#39;s face. It was a nothing burger</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.200" end="00:54:34.200" style="s2">it was you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.359" end="00:54:41.129" style="s2">Supposed scandal was predicated on an edited video which did not show that I said that I thought the age of consent was about right</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:44.040" style="s2">And it was based on it was based on a lie</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.500" end="00:54:49.320" style="s2">If it had been the case that everybody had seen what I originally said, they might have said</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.020" end="00:54:52.499" style="s2">Please explain this but it would not had the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.980" end="00:54:57.149" style="s2">effect that it did it had the effect it did because it was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.880" end="00:55:00.359" style="s2">deceptive dishonest misleadingly edited video</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.849" end="00:55:07.229" style="s2">Because I had created enemies on both left and right the establishment, right and the whole left teamed up to take me out</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.930" end="00:55:12.990" style="s2">You are walking into the same position so weird. So why do you see that? It was the establishment, right?</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.990" end="00:55:16.439" style="s2">Do you think that did it? They&#39;re the ones who did it?</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.990" end="00:55:23.729" style="s2">It was the ring. Well, it was a rating battalion National Review crowd who put that video together and shared it</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.730" end="00:55:25.270" style="s2">They were the ones who?</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.270" end="00:55:30.509" style="s2">Manufactured this because they were upset that I didn&#39;t give us stuff about CPAC because it means nothing to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.510" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even know what it was at the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:37.290" style="s2">But they were upset that I was speaking at CPAC because it was it was like their precious</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.160" end="00:55:42.930" style="s2">Pure conservatism thing had been over by Trump world, right?</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.960" end="00:55:46.379" style="s2">And so they didn&#39;t care so much about the Bill Maher</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.450" end="00:55:52.440" style="s2">but the sort of the National Review Reagan in crowd and created and propagated and shared and and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:56:00.179" style="s2">Do whatever with this deceptively edited edited video did so because they couldn&#39;t bear the thought of me being the star turn of CPAC</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:05.279" style="s2">Okay. And so and do you think that that&#39;s why they pushed so hard on the pedophilia front</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.590" end="00:56:10.650" style="s2">Yes, because they knew it&#39;s the one thing that the conservative base would go. Yeah, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.170" end="00:56:14.490" style="s2">And the left didn&#39;t take me out the right did</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.500" end="00:56:19.500" style="s2">No, well</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.930" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">To as well. So what power does the what power does the left have over me?</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:26.759" style="s2">What are they doing to me now that they weren&#39;t doing in January 20th 2017</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.370" end="00:56:29.460" style="s2">Nothing. Well, I think I think what</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.820" end="00:56:32.700" style="s2">I&#39;m not suggesting that I&#39;m correct</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.700" end="00:56:37.649" style="s2">But my impression was that it had something to do with the second of the two or three topics</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.650" end="00:56:43.799" style="s2">we were going to discuss which was your claim that the experiences that you had are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.320" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">characteristic of the gay community</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:47.320" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.320" end="00:56:49.559" style="s2">No, no, you see interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.690" end="00:56:57.240" style="s2">What actually happened about that specific thing is the entire gay liberal establishment when silent?</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.050" end="00:57:01.259" style="s2">Because what I said was and</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.260" end="00:57:07.830" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t phrase this way phrase it this way again because it was it was not quite what I meant and it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.500" end="00:57:11.550" style="s2">Let&#39;s say incautiously phrase to put it. Mildly what I</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:13.990" style="s2">said was the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.990" end="00:57:21.089" style="s2">Relationships between older men and young actually said younger men are a common function of gay life</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.090" end="00:57:23.090" style="s2">and I think I said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:29.099" style="s2">Afraid I think I said after a lot of drinks on the like a late night livestream. They can be hugely positive experiences</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.100" end="00:57:30.310" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t have put it like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.310" end="00:57:32.850" style="s2">I should have said they are a function of gay life</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.850" end="00:57:37.380" style="s2">And in many cases the city when like a 35 year old man with a 20 year old or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.870" end="00:57:41.099" style="s2">Very often at 35 year old will sort of induct the 20 year old</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.170" end="00:57:44.639" style="s2">Into the gay way of things show them where the clubs are</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.220" end="00:57:47.220" style="s2">Show them the ropes</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.530" end="00:57:49.950" style="s2">in lieu of parents because</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.710" end="00:57:54.059" style="s2">Because the boy&#39;s parents don&#39;t understand him. Maybe don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.790" end="00:58:02.099" style="s2">Or have rejected it or whatever. So very often. There&#39;s this sort of father. There&#39;s an either an avuncular or a paternal</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.430" end="00:58:10.889" style="s2">Dimension to these relationships on that point and indeed throughout being throughout the whole controversy</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.319" end="00:58:16.258" style="s2">The gay left went silent and February 21st 2nd and 3rd 2017</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.660" end="00:58:21.960" style="s2">Gay journalists were nowhere to be found in America because they did not want to have that discussion because they know it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:30.419" style="s2">Ok. Well, so is there the consequence of abandoning you by inaction then? No. No. No what I&#39;m saying is that that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.089" end="00:58:35.969" style="s2">What I&#39;m saying is that that&#39;s not what was so unforgivable. That&#39;s not was that that wasn&#39;t that wasn&#39;t the problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.759" end="00:58:40.949" style="s2">ok, so so then well in that case then I guess it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.979" end="00:58:47.789" style="s2">Not so much the difference in age, but the difference in wins in win that age difference starts</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.009" end="00:58:52.139" style="s2">So we&#39;ll say well according so so we&#39;ve had a conversation so far</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.799" end="00:58:59.849" style="s2">Which is presumed that the contents of what I said was important and that we should dissect it, this is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.729" end="00:59:06.059" style="s2">Because it doesn&#39;t matter what I said. It doesn&#39;t matter whether I was right to say it or what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.670" end="00:59:12.210" style="s2">Nuances or vagaries are of a particular statement that I say is deceptively edited here or whatever doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.450" end="00:59:18.599" style="s2">narrative was established and it was repeated by right and left and the person was ejected from you know from</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.670" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">Public life and from whatever right? This is what&#39;s going to happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.969" end="00:59:25.199" style="s2">This is what&#39;s going to happen to Ben. This was going to happen to Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.289" end="00:59:28.289" style="s2">Because nobody stood up for me</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.839" end="00:59:33.209" style="s2">The PlayBook became established and now that is your fate all of you</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.309" end="00:59:39.329" style="s2">That&#39;s how you&#39;re all going to go out and it doesn&#39;t matter what you say. It doesn&#39;t matter what the subject was doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.329" end="00:59:44.189" style="s2">What the incautious phrase was? I mean Candice Owens it could have could have happened to her recently with her</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.519" end="00:59:49.679" style="s2">Stupid this her stupid. She tripped over herself saying something about Hitler and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:53.489" style="s2">There was a sentence that I&#39;m sure she would phrase differently a second time everyone sort of knew what she meant</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.589" end="00:59:56.218" style="s2">But it could it could if the Stars</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.650" end="01:00:03.450" style="s2">Had aligned have done to her what happened to me in February 2017. The content doesn&#39;t matter. It was the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.969" end="01:00:08.759" style="s2">The left and right decided to take this personnel and any pretext would have done done fine</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.729" end="01:00:14.989" style="s2">So we&#39;ve had a discussions that are talking about what what was it? You said that was so unacceptable thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.900" end="01:00:17.820" style="s2">It was me</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.820" end="01:00:19.530" style="s2">it was the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.530" end="01:00:21.860" style="s2">The mystery look fair enough, you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.110" end="01:00:29.959" style="s2">I&#39;m not disputing that that there were any number of reasons to make you a target, but I&#39;m curious about why it was that</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.540" end="01:00:31.560" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.560" end="01:00:35.659" style="s2">interview that did it because cause shouting husband because I</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.780" end="01:00:39.620" style="s2">was scheduled to be the star speaker at CPAC and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.350" end="01:00:45.799" style="s2">The National Review crowd crowd could not handle it so they went through</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.470" end="01:00:50.959" style="s2">The hours and hours and hours and hours of old livestreams and they found something that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.550" end="01:00:55.550" style="s2">They found something that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.250" end="01:00:57.780" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.780" end="01:01:00.019" style="s2">Get to the Republican base</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.780" end="01:01:08.719" style="s2">Something they could sell to alienate me from Republicans rather than just the left and then they decided this person&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.600" end="01:01:12.589" style="s2">This is a power they still have and it&#39;s a power there. They will</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.410" end="01:01:17.450" style="s2">leverage against the rest of you to my question is</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.330" end="01:01:21.949" style="s2">We can talk a little about where I&#39;m gonna go next and what I&#39;m gonna do next</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.090" end="01:01:30.439" style="s2">Professionally because I think it might help the rest of you when this is inevitably happens to you, but</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.970" end="01:01:34.970" style="s2">It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.120" end="01:01:40.309" style="s2">This is a power that I still have it is a power that they can and will</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.830" end="01:01:43.399" style="s2">Leverage against other people and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.950" end="01:01:48.919" style="s2">the brightest star and the greatest standard-bearer the you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.920" end="01:01:54.560" style="s2">the court jester of the movement was allowed to be decapitated and because that happened</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.140" end="01:02:00.379" style="s2">The PlayBook is now established for it to happen to everybody else and it will happen to everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.380" end="01:02:04.220" style="s2">It&#39;s already happened to about two other people. You&#39;ve seen it happen since two others, right?</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.330" end="01:02:07.950" style="s2">Sargon of akkad</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.950" end="01:02:15.110" style="s2">Exactly, unless lesser lesser. This is now how it&#39;s going to be and it didn&#39;t have to be like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.660" end="01:02:17.660" style="s2">the only way that this</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.730" end="01:02:19.730" style="s2">boycott and administration</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.150" end="01:02:26.870" style="s2">Could have been successful would be if Republicans refused to would have been Republican said, okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.870" end="01:02:29.339" style="s2">We weren&#39;t invited to anything on our radio shows</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.860" end="01:02:31.630" style="s2">He&#39;s too hot to handle</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.630" end="01:02:33.779" style="s2">Too much drama too much hassle, right</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.510" end="01:02:36.510" style="s2">What the left does is?</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.910" end="01:02:44.220" style="s2">Immediately start putting that person on conference stages and panels to get over that period of like, who is this person going to become untouchable?</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.980" end="01:02:52.350" style="s2">They railroad that they drive a truck through that by immediately getting that person on TV and on conference stages a lot to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.320" end="01:02:59.969" style="s2">To you know to drive through that and to make sure that person doesn&#39;t get removed from circulation</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.340" end="01:03:05.489" style="s2">Right. That&#39;s what the left us when something when Linda Sarsour is discovered to have said something awful</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:10.470" style="s2">Suddenly she&#39;s on conference stages every two days. It seems like you know, she&#39;s feeling all she&#39;s doing this</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:13.500" style="s2">This is not an accident. This is on purpose. This is the left</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:20.610" style="s2">Leaping into action to ensure that she survives right</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.180" end="01:03:27.659" style="s2">Conservatives did the opposite with me. They allowed the left and the establishment Republicans who hate them</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.360" end="01:03:34.229" style="s2">To dictate who would and would not be a proper subject for discussion and who should and should not have</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.300" end="01:03:37.229" style="s2">you know a column and all the rest of it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.200" end="01:03:40.180" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.180" end="01:03:42.180" style="s2">absolutely suicidal</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.490" end="01:03:50.100" style="s2">Okay, and and the reason that so many other media figures were secretly happy to see it happen to me is that they&#39;re idiots who?</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.100" end="01:03:52.100" style="s2">Believe that this is a zero-sum game</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.210" end="01:03:57.240" style="s2">They think that by removing me they create space for themselves. This is not true</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.670" end="01:04:02.250" style="s2">There is nobody in the conservative or libertarian ecosystem who offers what I do there</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.250" end="01:04:08.129" style="s2">Isn&#39;t there&#39;s not a single fucking one of you can crack a good joke, you know, no get the odd good blood off onstage</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.860" end="01:04:11.969" style="s2">On YouTube. Hmm. You have your gifts that&#39;s not one of them</p>

<p begin="01:05:02.800" end="01:05:08.430" style="s2">Much more in the vein of an entertainment figure and much much less at the politics</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.160" end="01:05:11.399" style="s2">So the effect it might be a relief for you</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.710" end="01:05:15.659" style="s2">Well, not really because I quite enjoyed it, but the effect of this hasn&#39;t been to kill me</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:18.750" style="s2">the effects of the cowardice of</p>

<p begin="01:05:32.470" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">Because I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:41.490" style="s2">I&#39;m doing good. Okay, so let&#39;s talk about that being fine. So I want to go back to I still have a question about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.540" end="01:05:47.999" style="s2">Older man, younger man relationship issue. Can we talk about something else? Well,</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.380" end="01:05:57.960" style="s2">For humor me for two more minutes because there&#39;s actually something I want to go with this. Okay. So the the first issue is</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:06.359" style="s2">Where is the line property drawn in those relationships as as far as you&#39;re concerned with regards to age?</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.510" end="01:06:12.990" style="s2">And where and where is it usually drawn to socially now you&#39;re trying to get me now you&#39;re trying to get me in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.260" end="01:06:15.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m really not I don&#39;t want to get you in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.780" end="01:06:20.970" style="s2">I and I don&#39;t think there is a line to properly be drawn because you&#39;re basically just talking about a talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.070" end="01:06:23.220" style="s2">Degrees of degeneracy at that point, aren&#39;t you?</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.590" end="01:06:26.880" style="s2">You know the fact that you get saddled with this aberrant sexual morality</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.880" end="01:06:28.890" style="s2">And you don&#39;t have to go out and make the best of it</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.740" end="01:06:33.179" style="s2">the fact that you find this paternal or avuncular</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.970" end="01:06:38.309" style="s2">Dimension in a in a relationship with an older man that may also have a sexual component</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.310" end="01:06:42.029" style="s2">I mean this is layer upon layer upon layer of dysfunction</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.220" end="01:06:46.619" style="s2">So you&#39;re not going to get me to say ten years is the right gap because none of it&#39;s the right gap</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.620" end="01:06:48.620" style="s2">It&#39;s all fucked up</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.390" end="01:06:51.390" style="s2">Alternative</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.369" end="01:06:53.160" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.160" end="01:06:57.710" style="s2">Don&#39;t mean partly partly hydro selfish conversion therapy week marriage</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.739" end="01:07:04.069" style="s2">I wish conversion therapy worked at least said that before you&#39;ve least in the case of lesbians</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.069" end="01:07:05.430" style="s2">We know that we can</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.430" end="01:07:11.389" style="s2">Push women back into to back back with men and most of them will be happier as a result with men on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.700" end="01:07:13.700" style="s2">Some of us are just gay</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.829" end="01:07:15.829" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:23.028" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to be drawn on what the correct kind of fucked-up dysfunction</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.749" end="01:07:26.779" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t trying to corner you, you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.019" end="01:07:31.909" style="s2">well, I don&#39;t want to corner you this is something I&#39;m really curious about because</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.729" end="01:07:40.699" style="s2">You made the case and you made a strong case that relationships between younger men and older men were very common in the gay community</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.190" end="01:07:44.779" style="s2">And now see what&#39;s not me making the case. That&#39;s an established fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.779" end="01:07:46.909" style="s2">I mean every gay person knows that that&#39;s gonna things with me</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.910" end="01:07:52.069" style="s2">that&#39;s just me pointing out something that every gay person knows which is that when people when people first become</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.859" end="01:07:57.949" style="s2">Sexually active or aware of their sexual orientation or they first start to go out on the scene or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.960" end="01:08:01.309" style="s2">They very often form an attachment with an older man</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.309" end="01:08:04.879" style="s2">It may just be somebody five years older in some cases is somebody a little bit older than that?</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.420" end="01:08:10.430" style="s2">How that&#39;s happening at the age that it happened to you</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.119" end="01:08:16.399" style="s2">Happens all the time, I think happens everywhere. And I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.609" end="01:08:21.229" style="s2">think it&#39;s an inevitable result of having a an</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.290" end="01:08:25.879" style="s2">Aberrant sexuality where you have to seek out kind of alternative print</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.119" end="01:08:28.170" style="s2">alternative</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.170" end="01:08:33.230" style="s2">Parental figures because yours aren&#39;t fit for purpose for this particular part of adolescence</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.779" end="01:08:40.908" style="s2">You know, right but then you just said to that this isn&#39;t an objection that you don&#39;t see a clear</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.580" end="01:08:48.349" style="s2">Ethical pathway forward out of that. No, none of its ethical. I mean it&#39;s all debased and degenerate</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.339" end="01:08:54.869" style="s2">What do you mean by that exactly</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.869" end="01:08:58.609" style="s2">Because I think there&#39;s an element of predator earnest in almost every gay</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.889" end="01:09:03.649" style="s2">Interaction and relationship and this is just one example where it is more obvious and more</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.170" end="01:09:06.420" style="s2">visible, but I think that um</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.449" end="01:09:10.109" style="s2">There is a predatory component in</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.560" end="01:09:18.060" style="s2">Even gave me even in gay friendships you think about the way that some well that might have something to do with the more</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.580" end="01:09:20.580" style="s2">Arguably with a more predatory</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.370" end="01:09:28.709" style="s2">Element of male sexuality, right right and you talk about on discussable things, right? Will you take the controlling calming?</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.630" end="01:09:37.350" style="s2">Mediating influence of women out of the equation and men to just pipe each other up which is why they why gay gay men end</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.350" end="01:09:39.870" style="s2">Up repress curse right because you&#39;re taking out that some</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.049" end="01:09:47.309" style="s2">Restraint, right exactly restraints to look at we&#39;re losing talk you&#39;re taking out restraint. That&#39;s typically provided by the woman</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.160" end="01:09:50.160" style="s2">Instead you can just you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.830" end="01:09:56.219" style="s2">That was supposed to be solved at least in part by the introduction of like socially sanctioned</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.739" end="01:10:00.629" style="s2">monogamous relationships right because I&#39;ve had friends I knew about</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.179" end="01:10:03.329" style="s2">heightened male promiscuity among the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.699" end="01:10:05.590" style="s2">homosexual community and it&#39;s hyped by</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.590" end="01:10:11.219" style="s2">Substantial margin and the liberal types who I thought were reasonable and I certainly don&#39;t think all of them are</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:17.279" style="s2">Made to claim to me that the reason for that enhanced promiscuity. Was that all the male?</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.710" end="01:10:20.339" style="s2">homosexual sexual activity had to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.010" end="01:10:25.500" style="s2">Occur behind the scenes and that it was impossible for for men&#39;s ever dance</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.900" end="01:10:30.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a ridiculous argument male male homosexual promiscuity is</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.429" end="01:10:36.689" style="s2">Obviously simply a function of what happens when you put two men together attracted to or another and you don&#39;t have the restraint</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.179" end="01:10:39.179" style="s2">of a woman</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.360" end="01:10:43.140" style="s2">It&#39;s obvious and and also you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.580" end="01:10:47.609" style="s2">Successfully box a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.969" end="01:10:51.629" style="s2">transgressive sexual identity into</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.449" end="01:10:59.459" style="s2">Where we say hetero patriarchal institutions like marriage and expect gay people to just suddenly become you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.010" end="01:11:06.750" style="s2">Normal, monogamous whatever doesn&#39;t work like that. Well, okay, that&#39;s fine. So, but it seemed to me that in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.300" end="01:11:08.160" style="s2">That well</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.160" end="01:11:10.160" style="s2">Here&#39;s something else that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.239" end="01:11:14.069" style="s2">Going to cause trouble it seemed to me that that was kind of part of the bargain</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.070" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">Like wasn&#39;t that the bargain that I was so that was part of the deal is that you know in change for having this</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.750" end="01:11:21.990" style="s2">millstone around your neck in exchange for the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.600" end="01:11:30.059" style="s2">in exchange for the terrible agony of giving up fatherhood which you know, you can adopt and blah blah blah, but ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.060" end="01:11:34.680" style="s2">You know, basically it&#39;s like joining the priesthood, you know, you give up fatherhood</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.400" end="01:11:42.930" style="s2">In exchange you get to participate in a sort of taboo breaking transgressive experimental life</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.630" end="01:11:49.080" style="s2">That performs perhaps some kind of societal function might even perform an evolutionary function</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.690" end="01:11:52.770" style="s2">And which you have the excitement of the marginal</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.560" end="01:11:56.729" style="s2">Exactly. And and and that&#39;s that&#39;s why I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.730" end="01:11:57.030" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.030" end="01:12:02.039" style="s2">I am the world&#39;s greatest hypocrite on one subject on one subject only and that&#39;s gay marriage</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.290" end="01:12:06.780" style="s2">And that&#39;s because I don&#39;t have the foggiest idea what I think still even though I&#39;ve got one</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.030" end="01:12:11.189" style="s2">I&#39;m under no illusions that it is a union under under the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.380" end="01:12:18.210" style="s2">but I am I remain politically against gay marriage just by the fact that I got one because I&#39;ve met somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.700" end="01:12:23.399" style="s2">Completed me and I couldn&#39;t think of anything else to do. But of course I would marry him</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.890" end="01:12:27.119" style="s2">So I&#39;m very um, I&#39;m a mess on that subject</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.360" end="01:12:33.160" style="s2">No claim to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.160" end="01:12:39.300" style="s2">Coherent logical positions on that one subject that one subject. I&#39;m a mess. But the reason I always</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.880" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">Was so skeptical of gay marriage is that it was it was robbing us of the one thing that we had the one good cool</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:51.359" style="s2">thing about being gay that you had in exchange for the awful horror of</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.940" end="01:12:56.280" style="s2">not being able to produce a child with the person you love in the ordinary course of</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.280" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">sexual congress</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.530" end="01:13:03.119" style="s2">When you realize that and I don&#39;t think a lot of gay people realize that ever</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.340" end="01:13:06.149" style="s2">But I realized it quite early when you realize that</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.730" end="01:13:13.560" style="s2">you the bottom of your world drops out and you have to do something else you have to find a purpose and if your purpose</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.560" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">Isn&#39;t going to be fatherhood</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:19.200" style="s2">This is why so many gay men join the priesthood because they want to be a different kind of father</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.330" end="01:13:23.070" style="s2">You know they want they want to be to be a shepherd you</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.180" end="01:13:28.979" style="s2">Have to find some other kind of purpose and very well for gay men that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.010" end="01:13:31.180" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.180" end="01:13:32.500" style="s2">experimentation you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.500" end="01:13:34.739" style="s2">licensed that were given by the rest of society</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.070" end="01:13:37.960" style="s2">because we</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.960" end="01:13:40.230" style="s2">We don&#39;t have this other thing. Um</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.929" end="01:13:42.699" style="s2">Trying to cram</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.699" end="01:13:50.009" style="s2">Again, I&#39;m a complete hypocrite on this subject because I live in total married bliss. I live in I live in beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.679" end="01:13:57.719" style="s2">Monogamous domestic harmony, so I&#39;m a 100% hypocrite on this subject. But it just or it still feels to me a shame</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.719" end="01:14:01.169" style="s2">so to sort of condemn, you know our</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.989" end="01:14:08.399" style="s2">Experimenters, you know the people who are so over-represented in artists and musicians and and even politicians and warlords</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.400" end="01:14:11.190" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s it&#39;s a sort of condemn them to the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.460" end="01:14:16.739" style="s2">the same monotonous drudgery that you breeders have to have to submit to</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.920" end="01:14:22.020" style="s2">Yes. Well, I can imagine that it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of grates against your</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.659" end="01:14:24.659" style="s2">What would you call it your your?</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.090" end="01:14:28.409" style="s2">Anti-authoritarian my rebellious spirit and all the rest of it. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.219" end="01:14:32.729" style="s2">Poetic justice in some sense. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.190" end="01:14:38.129" style="s2">this is this is one of the many things that convinces me that God is real because there&#39;s no there&#39;s no that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.500" end="01:14:42.449" style="s2">There&#39;s a humor in that which could only have come from someone doing it</p>

<p begin="01:14:45.880" end="01:14:51.060" style="s2">give you something that&#39;s just gonna make just gonna remind you that you don&#39;t know it all and you and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.130" end="01:14:54.690" style="s2">Confound you for the rest of your life and remind you that you too are messy and complicated</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.690" end="01:14:59.429" style="s2">And on this one subject you are never going to be coherent illogical. Good luck with that</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.750" end="01:15:06.659" style="s2">No, don&#39;t another terrible question for you, so I I read</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.650" end="01:15:15.569" style="s2">Martel&#39;s book on the Catholic Church about homosexuality in the Vatican. It&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.489" end="01:15:22.408" style="s2">Contentious book let&#39;s say written by a gay man who claims that</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.949" end="01:15:25.949" style="s2">Homosexuality is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.380" end="01:15:28.300" style="s2">Extraordinarily common in Nevada</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.300" end="01:15:35.130" style="s2">it is and so and that the kinds of relationships that you describe between older men and younger men are</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.469" end="01:15:38.969" style="s2">Common in that culture as they&#39;re calling in the rest of the culture</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.969" end="01:15:44.999" style="s2">Yes, they&#39;re so I&#39;ve booked on this subject too, and I can tell you for a fact that both of those things are true</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.540" end="01:15:50.339" style="s2">There&#39;s it&#39;s called the lavender. Mafia in the Baskin it is the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.430" end="01:15:55.680" style="s2">for those those viewers who don&#39;t know it is a cabal of</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.260" end="01:16:00.089" style="s2">Not just gay bishops, but specifically progressive left-wing gay bishops</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.400" end="01:16:00.900" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.900" end="01:16:03.030" style="s2">And and my book was a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.100" end="01:16:10.200" style="s2">Politically focused than his my book was drawing attention to the fact that the same people who want to water down the liturgy who want?</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.410" end="01:16:13.410" style="s2">It for you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.510" end="01:16:17.010" style="s2">Divorcee is to be able to receive Communion and want you know gay people to do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.290" end="01:16:20.850" style="s2">They&#39;re the same people who&#39;ve been covering up child abuse in the church</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.950" end="01:16:22.950" style="s2">and and it seems that</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.960" end="01:16:29.760" style="s2">The same people have been doing the child abuse and covering it up are also the people who are most aggressively pushing for progressive reform</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.490" end="01:16:34.260" style="s2">Of the Catholic liturgy and of Catholic practice and this of course</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.320" end="01:16:37.590" style="s2">Resonates with what we know from other industries, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.590" end="01:16:43.950" style="s2">It&#39;s just like Hollywood just like the press just like the Academy the people who are most aggressively pushing for</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.770" end="01:16:51.569" style="s2">Progressive free-for-all sexual liberation other people with the ugliest and most depraved skeletons in the closet. The rest of us are quite normal</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.720" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:56.010" style="s2">My butt was more about that, but I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.650" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">It&#39;s absolutely true the mistake that the Catholic Church has made</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.200" end="01:17:07.439" style="s2">And I remain a Catholic despite the terrible state of the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.470" end="01:17:10.829" style="s2">Yes, and all the other contradictions in your life</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.310" end="01:17:14.310" style="s2">You know that</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.470" end="01:17:19.019" style="s2">They&#39;ve never bothered me. They&#39;ve never scared me and I&#39;m not afraid of that</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.020" end="01:17:24.720" style="s2">I&#39;m quite excited by that because I look forward to a day when I might grow either get closer to a resolution or</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.850" end="01:17:29.039" style="s2">be happy with you know with not finding one doesn&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.040" end="01:17:30.510" style="s2">You know I can I could imagine</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.510" end="01:17:35.579" style="s2">I can imagine ben shapiro would be kept awake at night by this but i&#39;m not you know, because I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.680" end="01:17:39.479" style="s2">Everything in my world to form into a perfect, you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.480" end="01:17:46.109" style="s2">it&#39;s like some sort of like Kantian or the contingent superstructure where everything has its right place and you know and everything is</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.840" end="01:17:49.049" style="s2">Perfectly organized all the dependent things are in the right</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.170" end="01:17:53.370" style="s2">That&#39;s not what human beings are. Like that&#39;s not what we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.830" end="01:18:01.109" style="s2">We&#39;re much much more complex and messy than that, and I&#39;m very much looking forward to 40 50 years of exploring my own</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.989" end="01:18:03.989" style="s2">ludicrous, you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.560" end="01:18:07.560" style="s2">But</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.600" end="01:18:10.109" style="s2">The the I remain remain Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.110" end="01:18:15.179" style="s2">But the the issue that the church has had the mistake that the church has made is turning a blind eye</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.760" end="01:18:17.760" style="s2">As the church would put it to sin</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.460" end="01:18:20.460" style="s2">turning a blind eye to</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.469" end="01:18:25.859" style="s2">Rampant gay sex in a vocation that is supposed to be celibate supposed to be chaste</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.300" end="01:18:29.650" style="s2">And we</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.650" end="01:18:30.880" style="s2">associate that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.880" end="01:18:37.469" style="s2">Hypothetically will the way that you would Martel&#39;s claim with the proclivity to cover up the child sexual abuse because of it</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.469" end="01:18:43.198" style="s2">Which is his most radical claim I would say I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s wrong about that. What I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.198" end="01:18:43.719" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="01:18:43.719" end="01:18:45.809" style="s2">The way that the way the church would put it is you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.810" end="01:18:48.149" style="s2">If you make room for one sin, others will follow right?</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:52.499" style="s2">so what what that means in practical terms for the Catholic Church is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.989" end="01:19:00.869" style="s2">Because the priesthood is somewhere where lots of gay men go and the blind-eye is routinely turned to their sexual peccadilloes</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.030" end="01:19:03.030" style="s2">Even if it&#39;s just with each other and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.030" end="01:19:09.540" style="s2">non-consensual or abusive going on because it&#39;s a sexual free-for-all because it&#39;s the kind of place where</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.179" end="01:19:14.399" style="s2">Supposedly transgressive or forbidden things happen routinely with no consequence</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.830" end="01:19:20.729" style="s2">Then it becomes an institution that attracts other kinds of people who have other things to hide like pedophiles</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.219" end="01:19:23.549" style="s2">Where where are you going to go if you have?</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.130" end="01:19:26.130" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.230" end="01:19:33.929" style="s2">Psychiatric dysfunction or whatever it is like that. You&#39;re going to go somewhere that routinely overlooks or ignores sexual</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.929" end="01:19:39.989" style="s2">Wrongdoing course you are that&#39;s what the church that&#39;s what that&#39;s what Christians mean when they say, you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.989" end="01:19:45.329" style="s2">You let one sin and others will follow they don&#39;t just mean in the sense of personal behavior</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.330" end="01:19:49.979" style="s2">Like if you let yourself do one thing you let yourself to others, but it also works in institutions, too</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.980" end="01:19:50.710" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.710" end="01:19:51.449" style="s2">Of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.449" end="01:19:54.029" style="s2">The lefties will say the reason that all of these problems happen</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.030" end="01:19:57.780" style="s2">The Catholic Church is that priests are required to be celibate. The opposite is true</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.140" end="01:20:05.129" style="s2">They haven&#39;t been celibate for a very long time and that&#39;s what&#39;s created the problem because there&#39;s now an entrenched left wing gay</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.130" end="01:20:07.739" style="s2">mafia, that effectively runs the like church</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.560" end="01:20:15.569" style="s2">That has engaged in the systematic cover-up of child abuse. So as to protect its own power and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.449" end="01:20:20.219" style="s2">about as bad as it gets, you know in terms of you know,</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.219" end="01:20:24.779" style="s2">A global institutions who have lost their way that is as it gets</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.449" end="01:20:28.408" style="s2">I want a black Pope because I want I</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.590" end="01:20:31.590" style="s2">want there to be a</p>

<p begin="01:20:38.349" end="01:20:41.519" style="s2">And it will make it it will make life very difficult for progressives</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.770" end="01:20:45.569" style="s2">Accusing a black Pope from Africa of being a racist in a sexist, you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.570" end="01:20:50.040" style="s2">because he actually wants Catholic doctrine to remain Catholic doctrine, but the present Pope is</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.460" end="01:20:57.270" style="s2">Basically, he is not himself a homosexual as far as we know but he does sit at the head of</p>

<p begin="01:21:22.239" end="01:21:29.459" style="s2">The soft on communism thing is entwined with the abuse with the wrongdoing with everything. They&#39;re the same people doing everything so</p>

<p begin="01:21:58.000" end="01:22:00.389" style="s2">But this hasn&#39;t happened since like Gregory the 7th</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.389" end="01:22:08.219" style="s2">The Catholic Church has been ferocious about choosing its own bishops, but they handed selection of the bishops over to the Communist Party in China</p>

<p begin="01:22:43.570" end="01:22:50.610" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s yet notice. It&#39;s called diabolical how Pope Francis betrayed clerical abuse victims like me and why he has to go</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.130" end="01:22:54.720" style="s2">It&#39;s called diabolical. So yeah, but anyway, I talked about that in books</p>

<p begin="01:22:56.860" end="01:23:00.089" style="s2">It&#39;s very interesting how the same people who are far</p>

<p begin="01:23:45.640" end="01:23:48.209" style="s2">the reason that this subject interested me in addition to my</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.030" end="01:23:53.069" style="s2">faith is that this is another arena in which the loss of</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.250" end="01:24:00.479" style="s2">Manliness and masculinity and the loss of a proper appreciation of the heroic masculine virtues has led to chaos and disaster</p>

<p begin="01:24:17.350" end="01:24:20.970" style="s2">With integrity would stand by and watch children being abused and cover it up</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.040" end="01:24:24.419" style="s2">This is something that gay people do because they think what they do is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.420" end="01:24:27.540" style="s2">so they&#39;re happy to cover for somebody else is doing something wrong to a</p>

<p begin="01:24:34.960" end="01:24:39.339" style="s2">He takes you know, he takes steps to stop it and he punishes the people who have done wrong</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.520" end="01:24:46.810" style="s2">That&#39;s the righteous indignation and outrage of a true father and those and that appreciation of you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.810" end="01:24:50.410" style="s2">Like it&#39;s it&#39;s right and proper to hate people and we should be outraged about though</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.540" end="01:24:54.040" style="s2">When you said that&#39;s part of what you&#39;ve learned over the last couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.290" end="01:24:58.269" style="s2">Right and but that heroic manly virtue is something that has been sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:02.170" style="s2">Systematically wiped out the Catholic Church just like it&#39;s been wiped out of other</p>

<p begin="01:25:05.630" end="01:25:07.130" style="s2">journalism</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.130" end="01:25:10.569" style="s2">And it&#39;s yeah assaults that everybody knows about in all those different arenas</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.570" end="01:25:14.590" style="s2">So it was interesting to me watching the book finding that most of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.800" end="01:25:17.780" style="s2">most of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.780" end="01:25:21.160" style="s2">things that are happening in the Catholic Church most of the problems that church has got itself into</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.770" end="01:25:23.830" style="s2">Basically boiled down to there being no men</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:26.350" style="s2">it&#39;s all women and gays and</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.630" end="01:25:34.299" style="s2">that the vast majority of the child abuse scandal and all the other things that are wrong with the Catholic Church our product of</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.910" end="01:25:41.709" style="s2">The church losing its connection to masculinity and simply having no men left in it. Well good. Well good</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.710" end="01:25:44.739" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing controversy about any of that. So that&#39;s quite a relief</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.410" end="01:25:47.410" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.590" end="01:25:50.590" style="s2">We don&#39;t have to be impaired</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.070" end="01:26:00.160" style="s2">Okay, so I want to return to something if you don&#39;t mind I want you to tell me</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.100" end="01:26:07.180" style="s2">What you think the consequences of what happened to you when you were 14 might&#39;ve been okay?</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.250" end="01:26:14.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t know. Yes, I</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.969" end="01:26:18.969" style="s2">Mean I look if you&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.400" end="01:26:21.400" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.739" end="01:26:27.129" style="s2">Unwilling to discuss it with you. Yeah, I&#39;m not having a problem being forthcoming. Yeah, I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.130" end="01:26:30.339" style="s2">I know the only thing that I&#39;ve really thought about is</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:34.689" style="s2">whether or not it might have affected the trajectory of my sexuality and</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.480" end="01:26:40.390" style="s2">I think that it may well have done but I don&#39;t think it on its own was enough to make difference. I</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.360" end="01:26:46.060" style="s2">think I&#39;m probably right about that also talked about just in this conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.660" end="01:26:49.660" style="s2">Transgressive me of</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.360" end="01:26:52.360" style="s2">That that</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.700" end="01:26:54.700" style="s2">sexuality and now you</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.010" end="01:27:01.179" style="s2">Participated in that even it&#39;s let&#39;s say as an active participant and the question is what did that do to you?</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.630" end="01:27:07.839" style="s2">What what did that what did the note do to you because you had to live with it. I</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.630" end="01:27:12.939" style="s2">Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fair question. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m crazy. No, no your phrasing it fun</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.940" end="01:27:14.940" style="s2">I just don&#39;t know the answer to it</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.170" end="01:27:17.769" style="s2">In the same way that I don&#39;t think anybody can know</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.740" end="01:27:20.979" style="s2">What quote unquote made them gay?</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.980" end="01:27:26.590" style="s2">You know as everybody has is born with I think everybody was born with a more or less of a predilection</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.750" end="01:27:29.110" style="s2">Whether or not you believe in epigenetics or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.780" end="01:27:33.579" style="s2">Some people do some people don&#39;t but I think everybody probably has a sort of predisposition</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.670" end="01:27:40.869" style="s2">And coupled with early experiences you end up by they&#39;re mostly having sex with men or not, right? I</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.750" end="01:27:43.750" style="s2">Don&#39;t think that we&#39;re ever</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.970" end="01:27:48.280" style="s2">Conscious of the processes acting on us at the time and therefore it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.280" end="01:27:52.030" style="s2">It&#39;s just pure speculation based on whatever we happen to remember</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.760" end="01:27:56.019" style="s2">trying to work out what it was that made the difference and</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.630" end="01:27:59.259" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that could ever</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.630" end="01:28:05.019" style="s2">Satisfactorily be answered because simply because we&#39;re just not aware of the process is acting on us. I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.630" end="01:28:11.170" style="s2">My dad not saving me from you know, that household made me</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.050" end="01:28:18.159" style="s2">You know sort of to made some kind of misfire a rewired like, you know, I said something haywire in my brain</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.160" end="01:28:23.559" style="s2">I don&#39;t know whether I resent it and just you know, just like my mother so much they went off all women</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.560" end="01:28:27.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever any way to know and for the same reason</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.700" end="01:28:32.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way that I could possibly answer and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything anybody could be on blind</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.200" end="01:28:35.590" style="s2">speculation and I think that most people who are</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.890" end="01:28:39.550" style="s2">Most people who try to explain I&#39;m so sorry</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.570" end="01:28:46.029" style="s2">Most people who try to explain or abuse might have done to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.760" end="01:28:54.760" style="s2">In almost every case. I see their political prejudices and their biases at work, you know out there in search of</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.310" end="01:29:01.539" style="s2">Justification ring isn&#39;t the truth is I have no I have no goddamn idea and neither. Does anybody else?</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.179" end="01:29:07.719" style="s2">No one can possibly have a clue because these things are acting below the conscious level on us in a way that we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.360" end="01:29:13.929" style="s2">Dissect and analyze. Okay. Okay. All right. So let me let me ask you then. Let me switch topics</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.929" end="01:29:18.638" style="s2">So, you know you&#39;ve been less in the public eye since this</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.310" end="01:29:23.289" style="s2">Scam quiet. I&#39;ve been retired. You&#39;ve been retired. Okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.179" end="01:29:29.199" style="s2">Look I saw a quarter of a million books. I made millions of dollars</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.199" end="01:29:32.289" style="s2">I have more nice stuff than I know what to do with I have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.869" end="01:29:37.359" style="s2">Husband I am deeply in love with I could die. Happy tomorrow. I helped to get a president office</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.360" end="01:29:41.380" style="s2">I&#39;m one of the seven people who put Trump in office and that&#39;s not eager to zoom. That&#39;s a fact, right?</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.380" end="01:29:43.540" style="s2">I&#39;m one of the seven people to put Donald Trump in office</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.540" end="01:29:48.310" style="s2">I can die happy now as you know, you might be do in purgatory for you as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.060" end="01:29:53.019" style="s2">Consequence after I die for that particular crime, who knows but</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.690" end="01:29:58.149" style="s2">But the fact is like I have accomplished more than the vast majority of people walking this earth</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.150" end="01:30:02.259" style="s2">I have you know, and if I were to do nothing else professionally now</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.260" end="01:30:07.900" style="s2">I would be infinitely more successful and all of my critics combined. Okay, so I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.840" end="01:30:14.949" style="s2">Rumors of your current state there&#39;s rumors that you&#39;re terribly embedded. There&#39;s there&#39;s rumors</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.989" end="01:30:16.989" style="s2">Okay, so I sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.020" end="01:30:23.379" style="s2">one of the problems with trying to find out what&#39;s true about me is I like to troll journalists and I</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.900" end="01:30:25.810" style="s2">Confirm or deny according to my whimsy</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.810" end="01:30:27.580" style="s2">So when somebody writes to me saying is it true?</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.580" end="01:30:32.289" style="s2">You&#39;re 2 million and down say no darling is 4 million what I work what I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.530" end="01:30:39.790" style="s2">go to the trouble of explaining is that of my many companies the one that was funded by the</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.159" end="01:30:47.559" style="s2">Mercer&#39;s who withdrew their political investments from Steve Bannon and from me at the same time that particular vehicle is somewhat in debt</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.960" end="01:30:49.550" style="s2">but I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.550" end="01:30:53.290" style="s2">Don&#39;t I don&#39;t have any personal liability whatsoever?</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.290" end="01:30:55.299" style="s2">The sum total of the money I owe</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.670" end="01:31:01.540" style="s2">It&#39;s about nine hundred and seventy seven dollars to capital one because I can&#39;t get any better credit cards in there because this country belong</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.540" end="01:31:03.409" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.409" end="01:31:05.739" style="s2">So so the core problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.260" end="01:31:08.440" style="s2">Have as much money as I had two years ago</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.630" end="01:31:14.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t but I&#39;m not two million in debt. One of my companies is</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.020" end="01:31:16.910" style="s2">And will probably have to either</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.910" end="01:31:21.069" style="s2">Try to fight it will have to fight its way out of that or it will have to you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.070" end="01:31:25.150" style="s2">Go through some kind of insolvency process or whatever, but I am NOT in debt</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.330" end="01:31:30.100" style="s2">I just never bothered to correct the record and frankly when a journalist if you journalist wrote to me</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.260" end="01:31:35.230" style="s2">so rudely noise if a journalist wrote to me and said are you 2 million dare and I made the very</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.510" end="01:31:42.040" style="s2">Important critical distinction between me and the business. Yes. They wouldn&#39;t write that up. Anyway, that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.040" end="01:31:47.589" style="s2">They would take my confirmation of the figure as confirmation that I&#39;m in debt and just write what they wanted to anyway</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.720" end="01:31:51.819" style="s2">so I feel no I mean it&#39;s not a crime to lie to journalists and I feel no obligation to</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.970" end="01:31:55.029" style="s2">to act as their fact-checking</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.550" end="01:31:58.000" style="s2">It&#39;s actually a crime to tell the truth to</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.130" end="01:32:05.739" style="s2">Journalists is a men a men know if somebody comes looted like a crime often if somebody comes to me to ask for comment</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.739" end="01:32:07.739" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a moral obligation</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.720" end="01:32:11.559" style="s2">Which is why I got myself into trouble that time before, you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.560" end="01:32:15.910" style="s2">when someone shot up the the newsroom, wherever that wherever it was because I I</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.430" end="01:32:21.369" style="s2">Made some flippant comment about vigilante death squads and journalists or something and I didn&#39;t post it publicly</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.760" end="01:32:24.460" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t like inciting people to hurt journalists. I wrote it</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.460" end="01:32:32.109" style="s2">To somebody who then published it and wrote a story about it and then they use that as evidence that I was cheating</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.110" end="01:32:34.100" style="s2">I&#39;m like, whatever</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.100" end="01:32:37.059" style="s2">This is the these are some of the consequences of being the kind of person who</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.270" end="01:32:46.180" style="s2">So my job is to create a career in which that doesn&#39;t matter because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.900" end="01:32:55.450" style="s2">Because my success my income my fan base my profile whatever isn&#39;t relying on</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.810" end="01:33:03.850" style="s2">The prestige economy, but it&#39;s also not reliant on this sort of rules of journalistic propriety or whatever. So this is why</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.780" end="01:33:07.460" style="s2">I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.460" end="01:33:14.859" style="s2">Reason, I&#39;m in Oklahoma is I&#39;m closing the last tranche of money to do a late-night chat show like Johnny codes</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.860" end="01:33:16.630" style="s2">This is the thing. I alluded to earlier in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.630" end="01:33:20.560" style="s2">I see I see. So that&#39;s part of your future plans and hillie work</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.560" end="01:33:23.410" style="s2">Who are you doing that with if you don&#39;t mind me asking?</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.410" end="01:33:28.869" style="s2">Are you still in the process of waiting to announce that I&#39;m still have announced anything yet?</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.230" end="01:33:32.590" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to the money in the bank first and I&#39;ll do all my hires and then I&#39;ll you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.660" end="01:33:35.559" style="s2">announce partners all the rest of it, but the thief</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.170" end="01:33:37.910" style="s2">the basic</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.910" end="01:33:41.289" style="s2">the idea of it is well, I should always have been doing which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.930" end="01:33:46.329" style="s2">Somewhere between Bill Maher and and Johnny Carson. I can do my characters</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.330" end="01:33:51.850" style="s2">I can do my Ellen Omar my doctor Christine kind of characters as cold opens, I guess and Al except they&#39;ll actually be funny</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.850" end="01:33:56.260" style="s2">I can do monologues. I can do interviews all the rest of it and I&#39;m a live act</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.260" end="01:34:00.309" style="s2">I&#39;m not one of these people that could just babble for three hours a day like, you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.310" end="01:34:03.220" style="s2">Some of the podcasters can do some of the youtubers can do I just find it</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.220" end="01:34:06.369" style="s2">So boring, you know, I don&#39;t want to just babble three hours</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.370" end="01:34:10.809" style="s2">I don&#39;t know wants to hear the same opinions from the same for conservatives or used every day</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.690" end="01:34:18.879" style="s2">Mind-numbing ly though that&#39;s not me. I&#39;m a writer and a live act right? That&#39;s where I live. That&#39;s my happy place. So</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.730" end="01:34:24.850" style="s2">It&#39;ll just be once a week. And so how are you going to how are you going to protect yourself?</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.850" end="01:34:26.920" style="s2">just out of curiosity about being</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.440" end="01:34:33.190" style="s2">From being censored and taken out like because I&#39;m going to make it laughs. I&#39;m absolutely anti fragile</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.320" end="01:34:38.349" style="s2">We&#39;re not gonna be on social media. We are going to encourage. He was not to share clips</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.350" end="01:34:40.870" style="s2">We&#39;re going to beg people not to put us on social media</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.870" end="01:34:43.420" style="s2">We&#39;re going to host the video on our own player on our own website</p>

<p begin="01:34:51.290" end="01:34:56.860" style="s2">Newsletters without theirs and all the rest of it. I&#39;m going on so it&#39;s something like próxima meaning a private subscription service</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.470" end="01:35:04.599" style="s2">Yes, it isn&#39;t completely dissimilar from Alex Jones&#39;s model. Just without the homegrown forums, right?</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.600" end="01:35:10.990" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s what we&#39;re hoping to allow people to do with this platform that we&#39;ve been building as an alternative to patreon you</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.900" end="01:35:16.599" style="s2">know on on a broader scale, or maybe I&#39;ll be on that because I feel happy because</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.150" end="01:35:19.150" style="s2">It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m not banned from perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.460" end="01:35:21.380" style="s2">I think these</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.380" end="01:35:26.109" style="s2">Hermetically sealed little universes are the future for us. Look social media isn&#39;t for isn&#39;t for us</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.510" end="01:35:29.769" style="s2">The people who run these companies hate us they are dedicated to our annihilation</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.840" end="01:35:32.380" style="s2">They want to see us wiped off the face of the planet</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.710" end="01:35:35.500" style="s2">there is no point handing distribution over people who hate and</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.690" end="01:35:40.479" style="s2">Why would you drive up the market value of these companies by providing them free content? She&#39;s silly and</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.330" end="01:35:44.289" style="s2">I&#39;m always the person who has to do it two years before everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.330" end="01:35:49.479" style="s2">So this is where I&#39;m gonna do you just just leave social media. I&#39;m gonna spend a bunch of money</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.090" end="01:35:56.319" style="s2">Converting my Facebook fans into a big powerful email list, and I&#39;m just gonna leave there will be life after social media</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:35:57.250" style="s2">Trust me once one up</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.250" end="01:36:01.780" style="s2">So once upon a time people didn&#39;t imagine that there would be no that myspace wouldn&#39;t still be here</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.780" end="01:36:05.709" style="s2">There was a world geo cities where the world moves on and in five years</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.710" end="01:36:08.320" style="s2">no one will have a twitter account anymore and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.450" end="01:36:14.320" style="s2">Worrying, you&#39;ll be wondering why on earth you were you were panicking about and the people who didn&#39;t look ahead will be lost</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.320" end="01:36:20.379" style="s2">I will have a three million strong email list that I write to every day with, you know a hilarious</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.140" end="01:36:27.340" style="s2">Daily column and they&#39;ll tune in on Friday nights to watch my show and I&#39;ll be perfectly happy. Nobody can take that away from me</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.220" end="01:36:30.220" style="s2">You know if we email providers</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.490" end="01:36:37.419" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of pretty much sort of semi told people already</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.420" end="01:36:41.379" style="s2">so the cat&#39;s kind of sort of out the bag, so I haven&#39;t really broken the news now, but but</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.930" end="01:36:46.269" style="s2">Once the money&#39;s in the bank, then I&#39;ll say then it&#39;ll be six to eight weeks before we have a set built</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.460" end="01:36:49.660" style="s2">So two months before we drop I&#39;m gonna have a very open</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.780" end="01:36:54.219" style="s2">Gestation process. I&#39;m going to show pictures of the set where it&#39;s being built all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.220" end="01:37:00.309" style="s2">We&#39;re not going to do like grand announcements because I&#39;ve done enough flows in my career. So we&#39;ll just have a very iterative</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.940" end="01:37:03.890" style="s2">Period of</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.890" end="01:37:09.490" style="s2">putting every person handling everything and then in about two months, I will draw episode one and it will be</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.040" end="01:37:15.430" style="s2">The funniest most hilarious unmissable hour of television that somehow not on TV</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.780" end="01:37:21.969" style="s2">Produced by anybody in the country and it will be unmissable and hysterical</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.670" end="01:37:28.270" style="s2">It will teach you something because I&#39;ll have a serious component to whether it&#39;s a mini documentary or an interview or a review of something</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.580" end="01:37:36.100" style="s2">And it&#39;ll be bookended by just the funniest political satire and you know and earn and and characters and nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.590" end="01:37:39.669" style="s2">but that nobody can do but me and</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.210" end="01:37:44.410" style="s2">It&#39;s sort of what I always should have done it&#39;s what I&#39;ve always wanted to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.780" end="01:37:48.639" style="s2">And now I have the breathing space if you like one no one&#39;s looking while no was expecting</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.800" end="01:37:50.500" style="s2">Daily this there the other for me</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.500" end="01:37:51.220" style="s2">I&#39;m in my room</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.220" end="01:37:56.230" style="s2">You know in my first retirement period well chair I will come out for a time and many times in my life</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.530" end="01:38:03.280" style="s2">This is some I&#39;ve had this nice space where no one&#39;s been kind of down my neck to deliberate</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.280" end="01:38:06.070" style="s2">Have you enjoyed that like is there being anything about?</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.590" end="01:38:12.579" style="s2">Advantages to you about the fact that you&#39;ve been sort of pulled away from the public spotlight. It&#39;s been it&#39;s been wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.830" end="01:38:17.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to I&#39;ve been able to dedicate two years of my life to getting to know the man</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.290" end="01:38:20.829" style="s2">I&#39;m going to spend the rest of my life with you know, and now we can go about</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.590" end="01:38:23.590" style="s2">Now, I&#39;ll throw myself back into the fight</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.780" end="01:38:25.750" style="s2">He&#39;s got his own career all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.750" end="01:38:30.669" style="s2">But we&#39;ve had something that most married couples don&#39;t get which is two years just together</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.980" end="01:38:36.250" style="s2">But the beginning of our life together, most people don&#39;t have that luxury or anything even close to it</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.250" end="01:38:41.319" style="s2">They immediately get bogged down in the everyday hell of you know, who&#39;s taking the kids to school</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.390" end="01:38:46.690" style="s2">Did you pay the gas bill crap? Right? We didn&#39;t have any we just had two years</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.330" end="01:38:50.650" style="s2">Lists together and now we have an unshakable foundation</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.810" end="01:38:54.070" style="s2">And if I&#39;m away for six months I&#39;m away for six months and they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.230" end="01:38:58.599" style="s2">Make a difference to us because we don&#39;t have the same set of vulnerabilities that a lot of newlywed couples do</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.000" end="01:39:02.679" style="s2">Because we had that that time together. So from to my mind it was time</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.680" end="01:39:07.869" style="s2">well spent I&#39;ve also been reading a lot and we didn&#39;t get to talk about anything really substantive in this conversation, except my</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.470" end="01:39:10.820" style="s2">Obscure</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.820" end="01:39:12.820" style="s2">psychiatric history, but you</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.250" end="01:39:17.829" style="s2">will see you will see that I&#39;ve been reading a lot and sharpening my claws and</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.490" end="01:39:23.320" style="s2">Refilling my tool kit and so when I do start</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.200" end="01:39:28.840" style="s2">We entering the arena and popping up on live streams and doing interviews and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.840" end="01:39:33.429" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that I&#39;ve spent two years reading everything I can get my hands on and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.030" end="01:39:41.170" style="s2">Considerably more formidable than I was two years ago. I was already quite formidable anything we particularly recommend</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.960" end="01:39:48.429" style="s2">Not at the moment. I&#39;m gonna keep my powder dry because I have I have lots of fun things that I want to that</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.430" end="01:39:50.090" style="s2">I want to do with it all</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.090" end="01:39:53.980" style="s2">but know I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been regrouping and plotting and</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.740" end="01:40:00.880" style="s2">Sharp. Oh, I can&#39;t imagine that a sharpening a sharpening my knives you don&#39;t you know?</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.880" end="01:40:02.949" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to be the first one in front of my blades</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.100" end="01:40:06.100" style="s2">no, it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.440" end="01:40:12.099" style="s2">People keep expecting to be sad or to have had some kind of terrible experience in the truth is I just happened</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.249" end="01:40:13.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve had the best two years of my life</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.940" end="01:40:20.139" style="s2">I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been in perfect bliss with the best man I&#39;ve ever met and now I&#39;m ready to go back to work</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.099" end="01:40:25.538" style="s2">All right, well look that sounds like a good place to end</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.280" end="01:40:36.909" style="s2">We could do this again and talk about something substantive instead of instead of my dreadful history</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.119" end="01:40:41.558" style="s2">yeah, well, you know you&#39;re an interesting character and so</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.349" end="01:40:46.929" style="s2">It was substantive as far as I was concerned and I think people will find it that too</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.449" end="01:40:48.499" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.499" end="01:40:50.499" style="s2">doing it happened to you was very</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.769" end="01:40:57.909" style="s2">Singular and but it&#39;s unexpected. It&#39;s important that people realize that</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.050" end="01:41:02.949" style="s2">The specifics of what was said or neither here nor there</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.489" end="01:41:11.529" style="s2">It was the fact that the the powers that be linked up and decided defenestrate this person and because</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.980" end="01:41:14.980" style="s2">Conservatives allowed it to happen</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.019" end="01:41:17.259" style="s2">They lost one of their greatest champions</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.719" end="01:41:24.879" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to be very successful with very profitable enterprises and perfectly happy just being funny for a living because I</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.429" end="01:41:27.079" style="s2">Sort of think to myself</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.079" end="01:41:34.449" style="s2">why would I keep killing myself for people on why would I keep killing myself for people who don&#39;t deserve me so</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.789" end="01:41:39.039" style="s2">So some degree the politics stuff. It&#39;s never gonna be gone, but it is gonna be dialed down considerably</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.039" end="01:41:41.889" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be talking about love sex death and money instead of you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.590" end="01:41:49.420" style="s2">Trump or whatever and well, maybe you spent you know, maybe you spent enough time talking about politics. It&#39;s not very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.119" end="01:41:53.709" style="s2">After a while and the people who are in politics are awful</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.949" end="01:41:58.598" style="s2">I mean if those of us who are kind of moving into that political sphere and have you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.059" end="01:42:05.139" style="s2">Aspirations toward being elected officials the rest of it they&#39;d be there becoming awful people. I mean everyone in politics is is</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.409" end="01:42:11.768" style="s2">Dreadful ghastly. I don&#39;t think I want to spend 30 years talking about or thinking about those people</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.249" end="01:42:15.249" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.380" end="01:42:18.159" style="s2">So yeah, I&#39;m gonna I mean not to say that there won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.099" end="01:42:24.099" style="s2">characters from the political or pop it up in my catches, but or indeed that I want to</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.770" end="01:42:28.810" style="s2">Of course, I&#39;m going to do journalism. I just want necessarily be a political journalism per se</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.810" end="01:42:33.160" style="s2">So perhaps I&#39;ll do a 20 minute mini documentary in the show where I&#39;ll go out into</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.260" end="01:42:36.490" style="s2">The country somewhere or I&#39;ll go to Sweden or I&#39;ll go to London or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.490" end="01:42:39.639" style="s2">but um, but as far as this sort of you know,</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.640" end="01:42:46.660" style="s2">The conservative movement stuff goes the conservative base are cowards and they are ungrateful and they are indolent</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.120" end="01:42:49.120" style="s2">and I</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.730" end="01:42:51.440" style="s2">gave a lot and</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.440" end="01:42:53.500" style="s2">Paid my dues and helped get a president office</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.500" end="01:42:55.240" style="s2">And now it&#39;s time to do what I want to do</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.240" end="01:43:00.579" style="s2">Which is make people laugh because that&#39;s that&#39;s the power that I have that nobody else in our world does</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.610" end="01:43:03.970" style="s2">So I&#39;m gonna focus on that. Yeah. It&#39;s a hell of a power</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.320" end="01:43:11.620" style="s2">I think he makes heterosexual men a certain kind of heterosexual man. Laughs I</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.630" end="01:43:20.410" style="s2">Like the I like the guy but I I don&#39;t personally find him, you know rib-tickling ly funny</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.140" end="01:43:23.619" style="s2">but then that&#39;s because I like people like Joan Rivers and</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.280" end="01:43:29.890" style="s2">You know that kind of universe so</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.510" end="01:43:38.770" style="s2">So he&#39;s maybe not my kind of comedian and he could it be um, but anyway this has been fun</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.980" end="01:43:43.660" style="s2">So thanks me. Look. I&#39;ve been looking forward to talking to you for a long time. Oh</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.390" end="01:43:50.709" style="s2">Say hi to Vaux for me. I will I will he&#39;s very much looking forward to to me speaking to -</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.890" end="01:43:53.470" style="s2">This is he that&#39;s what I wanted - well</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.470" end="01:43:58.449" style="s2">We&#39;ll just talk about things like the forward because it&#39;s interesting substantive things to do that you&#39;ve managed</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.690" end="01:44:02.049" style="s2">I know this was your strength of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.050" end="01:44:04.570" style="s2">Well, we will are you this for your strategy through this conversation?</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.670" end="01:44:10.330" style="s2">Which is not lost on me was to make sure that we don&#39;t spend too much time talking about you and you have been successful</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.330" end="01:44:13.930" style="s2">In that strategy because I&#39;ve allowed you to but the next conversation we will talk about you</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.810" end="01:44:16.730" style="s2">because I do want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.730" end="01:44:19.629" style="s2">The forward and I do want to talk about some of the things that you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.630" end="01:44:22.930" style="s2">the thing that I asked you about on Australian TV and whatever because I think that um,</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.840" end="01:44:31.120" style="s2">well, turnabout is fair play as they say right and I need no I did apologize to you unless it and I&#39;m and I&#39;m and</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.120" end="01:44:36.490" style="s2">I did make a mistake at the and I guess oh gee and thank you for that</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.280" end="01:44:39.670" style="s2">no III, I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.340" end="01:44:44.170" style="s2">Important substance to be spoken about you know as regards</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.520" end="01:44:51.070" style="s2">Well important things God and yeah there&#39;s what else so let&#39;s talk about let&#39;s talk about real things next time</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.070" end="01:44:51.370" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.370" end="01:44:53.829" style="s2">I think we&#39;ll think when I when I&#39;m feeling particularly</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.200" end="01:44:59.320" style="s2">Up to a battle I think about and I&#39;m sure a lot of people will watch this</p>
