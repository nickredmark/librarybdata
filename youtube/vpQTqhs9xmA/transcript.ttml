<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">many years famous from top level play a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">sort of a streak of dominance that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">like we&#39;ve never seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">but if anything it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">remarkable to watch your career after</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">chess where you&#39;ve taken on this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">incredible role in a very confusing age</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">as a champion of human rights and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">not sure really which of the topics I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.259" style="s2">want to hit most whether it&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">about automation and your famous</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.259" end="00:02:10.349" style="s2">interaction with deep blue but I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">that the thing I want to do is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.349" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">try to avoid some of the questions you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">get asked over and over</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:18.269" style="s2">like who is the greatest chess player of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:20.790" style="s2">all time thank you yeah yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.269" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">grateful so so let&#39;s try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.790" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">what that might have crowded out and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:28.200" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s move on to the next sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">things so to begin with one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.200" end="00:02:32.190" style="s2">things that I&#39;d like to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">about is something that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.190" end="00:02:39.989" style="s2">confused by when you played deep blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:43.620" style="s2">back in the late 1990s and the world 96</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.989" end="00:02:48.030" style="s2">and 97 right sorry mid mid to late</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.620" end="00:02:49.829" style="s2">nineties the world watched in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.030" end="00:02:53.489" style="s2">it probably hadn&#39;t watched a chess match</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.829" end="00:02:55.829" style="s2">since Fisher versus Spassky is that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.489" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">fair statement yes it&#39;s a fair statement</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.829" end="00:03:03.450" style="s2">I think that as was the most visible</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">chess event in history right because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">was not just chess event it it was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:16.170" style="s2">pinnacle of this human versus machine</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:20.250" style="s2">competition that was so fascinating for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.170" end="00:03:23.239" style="s2">general public for decades this match</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.250" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">was and is still surrounded by a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.239" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">thick form of Mythology and again what</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:31.349" style="s2">what to expect this was a machine and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">says people think oh it was unique</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.349" end="00:03:37.109" style="s2">accomplishment because it&#39;s the dough it</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">was a dawn of AI look a beady blue was</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.109" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">not intelligence at all this was not</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">more intelligent that your alarm clock a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">very expensive one 10 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">apiece but but the truth is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">machine that played chess in 1997 did</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:55.530" style="s2">not have to be intelligent at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:57.859" style="s2">because at the end of the day it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.530" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">about being intelligent it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.859" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">replicating this human process they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">just it&#39;s to follow either way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">making our decisions but it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">making fewer mistakes and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:12.660" style="s2">that&#39;s something that is is so it it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">actually most relevant a lesson of 1997</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.660" end="00:04:17.639" style="s2">match and also remind people have won in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">1996 right an IBM then chickened out</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.639" end="00:04:20.579" style="s2">they didn&#39;t want to play the third match</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">because probe let at that time I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.579" end="00:04:25.080" style="s2">still strong those pussies yeah no but</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">look it&#39;s a good business decision okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.080" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">as I explained in my book deep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:30.870" style="s2">it was a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:33.930" style="s2">decision because they look they knew</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.870" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">that in 1997 d blue was it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">powerful force but compared to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">either just two two machines today it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:44.130" style="s2">was just you know it was it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:45.570" style="s2">novice I mean it is today to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.130" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">what&#39;s happened over the last twenty</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.570" end="00:04:49.860" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">yes it&#39;s these deep blue in 1997 was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.860" end="00:04:54.900" style="s2">unique project of IBM where as millions</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">and millions of dollars invested and one</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.900" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">of the largest corporations on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:06.650" style="s2">planet today you can buy chess engine</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:10.470" style="s2">online and download on your laptop and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.650" end="00:05:13.110" style="s2">this computer this chest device right</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.470" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">will be much stronger than Magnus</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.110" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">Carlsen the current world chess champion</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:23.160" style="s2">right so and if you have specialized</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:26.120" style="s2">hardware for the same you know engines</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">like stock fish Houdini</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.120" end="00:05:31.740" style="s2">comecomecome order the difference in</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:34.260" style="s2">strength between these devices right</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">specialized hardware and Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.260" end="00:05:39.420" style="s2">right it&#39;s about the same as between</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:43.350" style="s2">Usain Bolt and Ferrari and Saudi Blue in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.420" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">1997 was not that good so with this what</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.350" end="00:05:48.120" style="s2">do we know if we if we took that exact</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:49.860" style="s2">software and you guys keep track of in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.120" end="00:05:53.340" style="s2">some sense how good something is by</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.860" end="00:05:55.950" style="s2">these a low ratings yes so what would</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.340" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a low rating today be relative to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:05:59.640" style="s2">the top I think we can just add yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:01.050" style="s2">thank you very much for just bringing</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.640" end="00:06:03.990" style="s2">these new numbers because audience</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.050" end="00:06:08.580" style="s2">always likes numbers so my highest</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.990" end="00:06:10.890" style="s2">rating my peak rating 28:51 28 2008</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.580" end="00:06:13.650" style="s2">hundred 51 now Bobby Fischer&#39;s highest</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.890" end="00:06:14.910" style="s2">rating was 2785 but in 1972 so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.650" end="00:06:17.310" style="s2">always have to remember that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.910" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the inflation was and still is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.310" end="00:06:22.350" style="s2">fact it&#39;s a relative system that it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:23.850" style="s2">nothing to do with chess itself no no it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.350" end="00:06:25.830" style="s2">is basically you know you know you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.850" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">perform well you add points you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.830" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">perform well you lose points and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:32.670" style="s2">point value predicts how likely you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">to beat so even you know if we play</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.670" end="00:06:35.760" style="s2">against each other we have the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:39.480" style="s2">rating so that&#39;s why you know and I do</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.760" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">let&#39;s say I beat you 6 to 4 so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.480" end="00:06:43.980" style="s2">means I add</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:45.900" style="s2">our ten points take away a little 10</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.980" end="00:06:48.750" style="s2">points as if we&#39;re this now if you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:50.550" style="s2">if the gap between us 200 points right</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.550" end="00:06:55.170" style="s2">score 80 80 percent I think that says</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">from the top of my memory God so it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.170" end="00:06:58.740" style="s2">its predictions based on the deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.930" style="s2">difference in our in our rating right</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.740" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">and then so I do better than predicted</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.930" end="00:07:05.730" style="s2">so I add points worse I lose points so</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:10.200" style="s2">go back to this is 2 to my absolute form</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.730" end="00:07:12.510" style="s2">absolute record was 282 28:51 Fisher was</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.200" end="00:07:14.850" style="s2">2785 but remember that when Fisher</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.510" end="00:07:17.850" style="s2">reached this this phenomenal height</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.850" end="00:07:19.920" style="s2">right there were no players in 2700 or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.850" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">and there were very few plays 2600 so</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.920" end="00:07:26.700" style="s2">this game it was a huge gap so this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:29.960" style="s2">2785 in 1990 72 probably was over 2900</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.700" end="00:07:33.420" style="s2">today so they&#39;re probably my 28:51 in</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.960" end="00:07:36.060" style="s2">1999 as well man was crossing highest</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.420" end="00:07:38.130" style="s2">rating was 2882 now he&#39;s about twenty</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.060" end="00:07:40.650" style="s2">eight forty so he&#39;s still you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.130" end="00:07:42.150" style="s2">traversing this 2800 category right</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.650" end="00:07:44.970" style="s2">there are only a few players actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.150" end="00:07:46.920" style="s2">crossed 2800 these days and they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.970" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">the range of 2028 ten twenty eight</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.920" end="00:07:53.910" style="s2">twenty so so and it&#39;s when I played the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:55.920" style="s2">blue so I was 2100 plus deepu&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.910" end="00:07:57.990" style="s2">objective strengths was probably twenty</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.920" end="00:07:59.640" style="s2">seven hundred plus but it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.990" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">objective strengths it&#39;s about how you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.640" end="00:08:05.300" style="s2">play in this very game and how many</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:09.150" style="s2">mistakes you make now today the if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.300" end="00:08:11.010" style="s2">have these chess engines on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.150" end="00:08:13.200" style="s2">specialized hard right that will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.010" end="00:08:15.390" style="s2">probably sooty four hundred it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.200" end="00:08:17.820" style="s2">for hunger it&#39;s amazing yeah it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.390" end="00:08:19.560" style="s2">it&#39;s again it&#39;s not because there but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.820" end="00:08:22.440" style="s2">want to ask this different question</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.560" end="00:08:24.600" style="s2">which is if we took the exact machine</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.440" end="00:08:28.440" style="s2">and the software and we took it out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.600" end="00:08:31.110" style="s2">mothballs from 1997 what do we think</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.440" end="00:08:33.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a low rating would be today these d</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.110" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">blue yes the old deep blue like old</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.330" end="00:08:38.970" style="s2">people i said it&#39;s this 20s maybe 2800</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:41.490" style="s2">but it&#39;s not more because it&#39;s it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.970" end="00:08:43.590" style="s2">magnus carlsen would be expected the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.490" end="00:08:45.390" style="s2">reason i ask it will be competition I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.590" end="00:08:46.710" style="s2">mean this is deep blue again I could</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.390" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">have been in the blue if we play this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.710" end="00:08:49.830" style="s2">showed match yes I would be a favorite</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">because I really learned a lot about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.830" end="00:08:54.630" style="s2">the thing is that I thought was so</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:08:57.210" style="s2">inspiring is that you talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.630" end="00:09:00.090" style="s2">we learn from these computers that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.210" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">humans are getting its machines made</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.090" end="00:09:05.250" style="s2">huge progress whereas since these</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:07.410" style="s2">machines today they are so much I am Not</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.250" end="00:09:09.660" style="s2">sure I can say smarter but is theirs</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.410" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">more advanced right and because don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.660" end="00:09:14.040" style="s2">forget deep blue was in it was not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:16.740" style="s2">a chess project it was a project of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.040" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">parallel processors so they had 256</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.740" end="00:09:21.510" style="s2">processors each of them was a mini</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:24.300" style="s2">computer that could make 1.5 million</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.510" end="00:09:26.190" style="s2">positions per second so combined they</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.300" end="00:09:27.990" style="s2">could reach phenomenal speeds of 200</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.190" end="00:09:30.330" style="s2">million positions per second 200 million</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.990" end="00:09:34.590" style="s2">which again today it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.330" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">not less it&#39;s not impressive but these</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.590" end="00:09:39.060" style="s2">these chess devices which we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">discussed on your laptop they will not</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.060" end="00:09:44.010" style="s2">be faster than 5 6 million positions per</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">second so they&#39;re not as fast but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.010" end="00:09:46.410" style="s2">are far more advanced because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.660" end="00:09:48.450" style="s2">have to be that fast</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.410" end="00:09:50.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not about calculating or alkylating</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.450" end="00:09:52.380" style="s2">because chess is some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.820" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">recognize chess is mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.380" end="00:09:56.700" style="s2">infinite or almost infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:58.950" style="s2">functionally infinite refers potentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.700" end="00:10:00.270" style="s2">infinite according to Claude Shannon you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.950" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">know one of the founding fathers of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.270" end="00:10:04.620" style="s2">computer science the number of legal</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.120" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">that&#39;s again that&#39;s that steeds just</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.830" end="00:10:13.830" style="s2">this number is just just it&#39;s cute</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:15.780" style="s2">imagination right exactly yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.830" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">not about calculating only but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.780" end="00:10:22.350" style="s2">about quoting word understanding and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.670" end="00:10:23.820" style="s2">programs today they they&#39;re so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.350" end="00:10:25.110" style="s2">advanced all right but love it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.820" end="00:10:26.730" style="s2">no there&#39;s no company there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.110" end="00:10:28.830" style="s2">question it&#39;s you cannot even touch them</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.730" end="00:10:30.960" style="s2">so just because even strongest players</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.830" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">you know there will there will be badly</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.960" end="00:10:36.210" style="s2">beaten now if you have a free chest app</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.840" end="00:10:38.010" style="s2">on your mobile phone yes that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.210" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">as good as deep blue right thanks to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.010" end="00:10:42.690" style="s2">Moore&#39;s law which is very impressive but</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:44.910" style="s2">what I really want to get at is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.690" end="00:10:46.950" style="s2">reason that chess matters to us and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.910" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">reason that we all thrilled to it has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.950" end="00:10:51.830" style="s2">do with its legacy the way its interwove</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:54.840" style="s2">entire society our culture our</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.830" end="00:10:56.940" style="s2">storytelling even our language we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.840" end="00:10:59.190" style="s2">constantly searching for chess metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.940" end="00:11:01.650" style="s2">and one of the things that animates us</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.190" end="00:11:04.350" style="s2">is the poetry of chess that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.650" end="00:11:06.839" style="s2">when fathers and sons for example would</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.350" end="00:11:08.100" style="s2">pull out you know games of morphe or</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.839" end="00:11:10.259" style="s2">something and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.100" end="00:11:13.949" style="s2">to show something really graceful and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.259" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">beautiful we would look to the Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.949" end="00:11:16.050" style="s2">game or the immortal game or something</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.050" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">and it lifts our spirits and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:22.709" style="s2">we&#39;re really focused not on who won or</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:24.420" style="s2">who lost but on the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.709" end="00:11:26.759" style="s2">brilliance ease when does somebody do</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.420" end="00:11:29.190" style="s2">something so unexpected and so daring</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.759" end="00:11:31.560" style="s2">that they put themselves at great risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.190" end="00:11:34.589" style="s2">and then managed to somehow extricate</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.560" end="00:11:38.579" style="s2">themselves what I want to know is are we</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.589" end="00:11:40.829" style="s2">in a position to program computers for</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.579" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">brilliance ease and poetry&#39;s rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.829" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">simply brute force okay let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:49.290" style="s2">your assumptions you can unreal you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:52.380" style="s2">assumption others actually assertion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.290" end="00:11:55.380" style="s2">an aura concept of us because you said</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.380" end="00:11:57.899" style="s2">few times us okay yeah it&#39;s the now at</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.380" end="00:12:00.449" style="s2">the era of globalization we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.899" end="00:12:03.509" style="s2">recognize that you know us you know look</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.449" end="00:12:05.399" style="s2">different in different quarters the game</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.509" end="00:12:07.829" style="s2">of chess that you mentioned it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.399" end="00:12:10.019" style="s2">it&#39;s not the only game of chess that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.829" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">does exist sure so and one that came</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.019" end="00:12:14.430" style="s2">from AG india through Persia it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:16.410" style="s2">one of one of the versions but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.430" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">India again we don&#39;t have any records</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.410" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">about India we definitely have few</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.790" end="00:12:25.860" style="s2">records about the game played in in its</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:27.649" style="s2">the records come actually from the Arab</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.860" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">world okay so what we know about</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.649" end="00:12:32.850" style="s2">European chess let me call European</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.009" style="s2">chess is that the game traveled from you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.850" end="00:12:39.139" style="s2">know from the Arab world to Iberian</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.009" end="00:12:41.910" style="s2">Peninsula and the first book that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.139" end="00:12:46.740" style="s2">presented the compilation of chess</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.910" end="00:12:48.899" style="s2">studies played by you know in old Arab</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.740" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">rule shatranj you know much slower game</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.899" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">because the game of just always</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:54.630" style="s2">reflected some sort of it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.890" end="00:15:41.880" style="s2">idea that even IQ of course is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:44.430" style="s2">intelligence it&#39;s a particular measure</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.880" end="00:15:45.930" style="s2">of a something I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.430" end="00:15:47.490" style="s2">happen to know him but I went to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.930" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">graduate school in the same year as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.490" end="00:15:54.810" style="s2">guy named Noah Mel keys who you know is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:57.089" style="s2">it&#39;s the main he&#39;s this rally chess</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.810" end="00:15:59.580" style="s2">composer yes yes yes yes yes I just</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.089" end="00:16:02.040" style="s2">because I I had a book in air of just</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.580" end="00:16:05.070" style="s2">you know of the Bell it&#39;s there of of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.040" end="00:16:06.690" style="s2">the best Israeli chess studies yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.070" end="00:16:09.000" style="s2">and I just that&#39;s that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.690" end="00:16:12.230" style="s2">recognized well yeah but he was like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.000" end="00:16:14.700" style="s2">youngest full professor at Harvard yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.230" end="00:16:16.380" style="s2">it&#39;s what he was a hobby but that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.700" end="00:16:19.350" style="s2">the great stuff but he comments on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.380" end="00:16:21.060" style="s2">fact that he can only achieve the level</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.350" end="00:16:23.610" style="s2">of chess master even though he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.060" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">grandmaster in problem-solving and salt</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.610" end="00:16:27.630" style="s2">and composing and so there&#39;s even there</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s like something very mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.630" end="00:16:32.010" style="s2">because this is a sort of like a john</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.760" end="00:16:34.410" style="s2">von neumann like level of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.010" end="00:16:36.870" style="s2">and he&#39;s commenting on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.410" end="00:16:38.490" style="s2">he&#39;s merely a chess master and so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.870" end="00:16:40.230" style="s2">found that to be quite shocking and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.490" end="00:16:43.200" style="s2">surprising because I know how how some</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.230" end="00:16:46.260" style="s2">how amazing know&#39;m is look it gets it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.200" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s not yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.260" end="00:16:49.170" style="s2">absolutely about it because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:51.570" style="s2">about competition you have to you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.170" end="00:16:53.940" style="s2">to compete I mean I he&#39;s great mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.570" end="00:16:56.370" style="s2">feels probably more more at home by</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.940" end="00:16:59.310" style="s2">composing you know it&#39;s just easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.370" end="00:17:01.320" style="s2">comfortably study you can think about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.310" end="00:17:01.829" style="s2">so he can you know get there&#39;s no time</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.320" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">pressure</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.829" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">there&#39;s no opponent just you know across</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">the board you know no intimidation</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:10.350" style="s2">exactly so getting back to brilliance</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:12.870" style="s2">ease which I don&#39;t want you to evoke a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.350" end="00:17:15.750" style="s2">no no I&#39;m not avoiding it because I you</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.650" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">it for simple reason because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">know it brilliancy and and and about</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.980" end="00:19:01.140" style="s2">made opponent&#39;s king that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.380" end="00:19:02.820" style="s2">the most popular console masterpiece but</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.140" end="00:19:04.500" style="s2">you can have a very slow motion</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.820" end="00:19:06.660" style="s2">positional masterpiece you know by just</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.500" end="00:19:08.130" style="s2">adding you know disadvantage micro</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.660" end="00:19:11.040" style="s2">advantage after and one after another</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.130" end="00:19:14.070" style="s2">and strike strangling your opponent it</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.040" end="00:19:16.620" style="s2">could be a mixture of that so but again</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.070" end="00:19:19.410" style="s2">you for example described the current</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.620" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">number one Magnus Carlsen is a mixture</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.410" end="00:19:26.730" style="s2">of Karpov and Fischer yes and in Fischer</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:28.650" style="s2">was the obvious sort of virtuoso at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.730" end="00:19:31.260" style="s2">level of masterpiece but you pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.650" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">that Karpov was a master of maximum</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.260" end="00:19:35.970" style="s2">efficiency of the power of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:39.570" style="s2">piece to do the most with the least yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.970" end="00:19:42.450" style="s2">absolutely and Magnus is is this lethal</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.570" end="00:19:44.580" style="s2">combination of two because Fisher I</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.450" end="00:19:47.670" style="s2">think it just it was it was a rough but</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.580" end="00:19:49.350" style="s2">his I mean sheer energy he could play</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.670" end="00:19:51.930" style="s2">until the last poem you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.350" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">basically squeezing you know water out</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.930" end="00:19:56.460" style="s2">of a stone now Harper was good either</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:19:59.490" style="s2">just in in in getting the maximum effect</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.460" end="00:20:03.090" style="s2">out of the minimum you know resources</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.490" end="00:20:05.880" style="s2">e-e-e are available but he was not as</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.090" end="00:20:09.060" style="s2">consistent as Fisher not so pushy he</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.880" end="00:20:11.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it was more relaxed so Magnus</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.060" end="00:20:13.170" style="s2">brings them together and that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.130" end="00:20:15.780" style="s2">he has carpals ability to you to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.170" end="00:20:17.790" style="s2">maximize the effect of his pieces but</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.780" end="00:20:19.980" style="s2">also he will play to the very last point</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.790" end="00:20:23.550" style="s2">the very last move as Fisher did right</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.980" end="00:20:26.220" style="s2">and okay so I think what you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.550" end="00:20:28.590" style="s2">me is is that we are not yet able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.220" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">figure out how to encode the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.590" end="00:20:32.850" style="s2">brilliancy so that we may lose to these</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">machines but that the poetry to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.850" end="00:20:38.160" style="s2">extracted from chess at one level</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">belongs to this positional brute force</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.160" end="00:20:41.700" style="s2">aspect and another belongs to something</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:46.650" style="s2">that&#39;s ineffable that we can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.700" end="00:20:48.120" style="s2">touch look yes it&#39;s the and I and I took</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.650" end="00:20:50.100" style="s2">your point about the sacrifices that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.120" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a sort of an obvious version of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.100" end="00:20:56.190" style="s2">risk this interesting thing is the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:59.910" style="s2">the the latest chess computer prodigy</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.190" end="00:21:03.330" style="s2">growth all for zero that&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.910" end="00:21:05.970" style="s2">program run by demis hassabis and his</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.330" end="00:21:10.260" style="s2">team it&#39;s the deep mind team that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.970" end="00:21:13.350" style="s2">working for Google they succeeded in</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.260" end="00:21:15.540" style="s2">impeding the best go players ah then</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.350" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">they just they came up with this concept</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.540" end="00:21:19.680" style="s2">of alpha zero which is you know starting</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:22.140" style="s2">from the scratch so the machine knows</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.680" end="00:21:25.080" style="s2">only the rules what is God what is chess</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.140" end="00:21:26.850" style="s2">what is a Starcraft any game and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.080" end="00:21:29.820" style="s2">you know it plays against itself it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.850" end="00:21:31.500" style="s2">learns from which old experience no</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.820" end="00:21:33.420" style="s2">human contamination which is very funny</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.500" end="00:21:35.310" style="s2">because that one definition of genius is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.420" end="00:21:39.630" style="s2">the fire that lights itself yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.310" end="00:21:41.940" style="s2">it&#39;s but but yes and and it it it played</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.630" end="00:21:43.620" style="s2">against stockfish against is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.940" end="00:21:46.680" style="s2">strongest chess engines and it did it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.620" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">convincingly a number of times but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.680" end="00:21:50.700" style="s2">stock fish got better yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:52.590" style="s2">still alpha zero still dominates the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.700" end="00:21:54.150" style="s2">game now okay when we look at these</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.590" end="00:21:55.710" style="s2">games you know and that&#39;s the first time</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.150" end="00:21:58.940" style="s2">when I thought oh wow I can learn</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.710" end="00:22:01.950" style="s2">something for this machine&#39;s alpha zero</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.940" end="00:22:03.390" style="s2">played chess more aggressively contrary</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.950" end="00:22:06.450" style="s2">to our expectations that stronger</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.390" end="00:22:09.060" style="s2">machines will play dollar games more you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.450" end="00:22:12.870" style="s2">know just it&#39;s the slow-mo games because</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.060" end="00:22:14.550" style="s2">they every sacrifice can can be refuted</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.870" end="00:22:15.779" style="s2">so that&#39;s why machines they don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.550" end="00:22:18.029" style="s2">too much risk but</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.779" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">alpha zero contrary to our beliefs you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.029" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">know played very aggressive chess</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:25.590" style="s2">sacrificing material and and and being</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:30.419" style="s2">bidding stockfish machine not humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.590" end="00:22:32.219" style="s2">it&#39;s by just you know always being one</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.419" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">or two moves ahead in anticipating</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.219" end="00:22:38.249" style="s2">what&#39;s coming next</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.059" end="00:22:41.279" style="s2">now it&#39;s I use words sacrifice yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.249" end="00:22:44.429" style="s2">for deep for for machine for alpha zero</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.279" end="00:22:47.089" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a sacrifice alpha zero thanks</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.429" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">to its massive experience through these</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.089" end="00:22:53.429" style="s2">660 million games six zero sixty million</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:57.269" style="s2">games like yes itself so it generated a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.429" end="00:22:59.129" style="s2">bank of of data services which provided</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.269" end="00:22:59.759" style="s2">its you know better understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.129" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.759" end="00:23:04.830" style="s2">so when alpha 0 is sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:07.259" style="s2">quote-unquote it is we saw it as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.830" end="00:23:13.259" style="s2">sacrifice it for alpha zero it was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.259" end="00:23:16.109" style="s2">transformation of a material pawns or or</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.259" end="00:23:18.239" style="s2">or pieces into other factors that were</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.109" end="00:23:18.749" style="s2">more decision or moment exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.239" end="00:23:20.489" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.749" end="00:23:22.950" style="s2">so and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.489" end="00:23:24.719" style="s2">amazing that it&#39;s alpha zero that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.950" end="00:23:26.700" style="s2">had you know just look at the fuel</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.719" end="00:23:28.349" style="s2">positions it&#39;s about one percent of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.700" end="00:23:30.809" style="s2">you know when you look at the ID at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.349" end="00:23:33.509" style="s2">number of positions analyzed also stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.809" end="00:23:34.909" style="s2">fish it was far more prescient</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.509" end="00:23:37.409" style="s2">in understanding what&#39;s coming next</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.909" end="00:23:39.570" style="s2">again playing without the material stock</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.409" end="00:23:40.859" style="s2">fish you know it took you know one or</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.570" end="00:23:42.989" style="s2">two moves that you understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.859" end="00:23:44.519" style="s2">coming because it looked and it again</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.989" end="00:23:45.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s the combination was</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.519" end="00:23:48.059" style="s2">winning it when alpha zero made</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.960" end="00:23:49.649" style="s2">sacrifices yeah it was not a forced win</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.059" end="00:23:51.690" style="s2">because stop fish would have seen it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.649" end="00:23:54.059" style="s2">well okay but it&#39;s it was you know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.690" end="00:23:56.879" style="s2">was again deeper understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.059" end="00:24:00.089" style="s2">game based on on on on it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.879" end="00:24:02.669" style="s2">pattern that it it was able to design</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.089" end="00:24:04.739" style="s2">out of these sixty million games but in</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.669" end="00:24:06.479" style="s2">general I would think about really you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.739" end="00:24:08.070" style="s2">can imagine me telling you what a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.479" end="00:24:09.779" style="s2">brilliance is it&#39;s ridiculous I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.070" end="00:24:13.139" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know exactly really games</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.779" end="00:24:16.049" style="s2">but it&#39;s but one thing I might define it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.139" end="00:24:18.210" style="s2">as is anything that where there would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.049" end="00:24:19.859" style="s2">a body of conventional wisdom and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.210" end="00:24:22.769" style="s2">there&#39;s a move that is deeply weird</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.859" end="00:24:24.869" style="s2">relative to that expectation so for</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.769" end="00:24:26.940" style="s2">example a move that doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.869" end="00:24:28.860" style="s2">develop anything it&#39;s like I almost a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.940" end="00:24:30.660" style="s2">waste a throwaway move could also be</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.860" end="00:24:32.790" style="s2">brilliancy if it turned out that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.660" end="00:24:35.429" style="s2">unlocked something nobody could see yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.790" end="00:24:37.860" style="s2">yes anything that surprises people right</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.429" end="00:24:40.890" style="s2">it&#39;s good brilliant so you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.860" end="00:24:42.750" style="s2">one of the most brilliant moves based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.890" end="00:24:45.660" style="s2">your definition sure I ever made was</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.750" end="00:24:47.490" style="s2">game 24 I played Anatoly Karpov it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.660" end="00:24:49.470" style="s2">was a unique moment when you just you</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.490" end="00:24:51.750" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s I had to survive this</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.470" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">game and Karpov to win the game to to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.750" end="00:24:56.190" style="s2">retain his title right one you point</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:59.040" style="s2">ahead and it was the last game of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.190" end="00:25:01.530" style="s2">match and carpel had a very you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.040" end="00:25:04.049" style="s2">potential very strong attack and I found</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.530" end="00:25:06.030" style="s2">a move that was totally illogical by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.049" end="00:25:08.340" style="s2">way ever since this game is this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.030" end="00:25:11.880" style="s2">idea became with a part of the defensive</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.340" end="00:25:13.919" style="s2">a concept for okay for black but at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.880" end="00:25:14.370" style="s2">time you know it was just it looked so</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:16.260" style="s2">ugly</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.370" end="00:25:19.620" style="s2">because you don&#39;t put this rooks you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.260" end="00:25:21.750" style="s2">know just something just in a position</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.620" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">where it has no other moves around by</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.750" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">you by your own pieces but it was not</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">about you know it&#39;s not about attacking</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:29.490" style="s2">basically it was a very good</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">prophylactic moves because it prevented</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.490" end="00:25:33.660" style="s2">big threats from from from white and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">had to force carpenters are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.660" end="00:25:38.490" style="s2">other plans so you know it&#39;s and I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:40.350" style="s2">very happy when I just I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.490" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">made this move because I just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.350" end="00:25:43.470" style="s2">understand how else to defend it just</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:44.760" style="s2">was so much against you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.470" end="00:25:46.770" style="s2">learned but that they made him move and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.760" end="00:25:48.450" style="s2">I remember when I just you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.770" end="00:25:51.090" style="s2">this is when Harper came to stage he</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.450" end="00:25:53.250" style="s2">looked at this and then it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.090" end="00:25:54.510" style="s2">another great player he realized that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.250" end="00:26:00.150" style="s2">he&#39;s move basically killed he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.510" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">attacking in a structure and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.150" end="00:26:03.960" style="s2">and and he had to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:07.140" style="s2">regrouping pieces wasting time and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.960" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">just adding yes it&#39;s definitely it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.140" end="00:26:11.730" style="s2">just a strong move but it was so unusual</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:13.770" style="s2">move looking weird but it&#39;s it shoot</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.730" end="00:26:15.179" style="s2">Karpis confidence and and and he quickly</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.770" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">made mistake allows the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.179" end="00:26:19.290" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:21.570" style="s2">okay here&#39;s a question that I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.290" end="00:26:23.220" style="s2">been able to ask and maybe if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.570" end="00:26:25.740" style="s2">make sense you&#39;ll help me formulate a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.220" end="00:26:29.880" style="s2">better one I guess when we lost</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.740" end="00:26:34.650" style="s2">I mean checkers was solved yeah chess we</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.880" end="00:26:38.760" style="s2">lost with you in it so Gautier okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.650" end="00:26:40.530" style="s2">but the question is after go I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.760" end="00:26:42.300" style="s2">expected something to happen that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.530" end="00:26:46.530" style="s2">happen I expected someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.300" end="00:26:48.810" style="s2">start trying to create a new game which</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.530" end="00:26:50.610" style="s2">in which humans would still have an</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.810" end="00:26:53.310" style="s2">advantage that had the deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.610" end="00:26:56.850" style="s2">characteristics and everyone seems so de</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.310" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">motivated by this experience like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.850" end="00:27:02.730" style="s2">the point why are we why race it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:04.680" style="s2">trying to continue to be a better number</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.730" end="00:27:07.560" style="s2">multiplier in an age of computers</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:10.380" style="s2">there&#39;s no point have we become</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.560" end="00:27:12.840" style="s2">demotivated is anyone searching for</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.380" end="00:27:14.490" style="s2">things that show off and accentuate what</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.840" end="00:27:17.610" style="s2">humans still do better than any any</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.490" end="00:27:21.000" style="s2">machine it&#39;s a very important question</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.610" end="00:27:23.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s just it&#39;s I think you just so</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.000" end="00:27:26.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like home run because it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.940" end="00:27:28.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a question that&#39;s in different</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.300" end="00:27:33.090" style="s2">modifications I hear all the time since</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.920" end="00:27:35.160" style="s2">I now speak three times months the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.090" end="00:27:36.870" style="s2">conference&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s about AI it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.160" end="00:27:40.260" style="s2">about cybersecurity and about you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.870" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">human machine collaboration and in about</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.260" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">vanity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.020" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">the the answer is that it&#39;s we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.300" end="00:27:56.130" style="s2">demotivated I think we&#39;re more pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:56.940" style="s2">we simply understand that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.130" end="00:28:00.300" style="s2">make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.940" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just chess or God it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.300" end="00:28:06.210" style="s2">a Starcraft it&#39;s Texas Hold&#39;em poker</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:08.850" style="s2">it&#39;s in you name games you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.210" end="00:28:11.370" style="s2">it&#39;s at the end of the day machines will</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.850" end="00:28:13.260" style="s2">always prevail so to make it you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.370" end="00:28:16.140" style="s2">easier for my audience to understand I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:19.890" style="s2">always tell them that every game can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.140" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">described as a closed system and if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.890" end="00:28:23.400" style="s2">have if you build a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.110" style="s2">eventually computer will always win</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.400" end="00:28:27.660" style="s2">exactly okay yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.110" end="00:28:30.840" style="s2">so the human strengths is not you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.660" end="00:28:32.520" style="s2">is not trying to compete with machines</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.840" end="00:28:33.960" style="s2">and closed systems because if we know</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.520" end="00:28:35.730" style="s2">how to do it machines will do it better</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.960" end="00:28:37.800" style="s2">well and not because they&#39;re perfect</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.730" end="00:28:39.720" style="s2">again that&#39;s important they will never</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.800" end="00:28:42.120" style="s2">reach 100% perfection it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.720" end="00:28:44.760" style="s2">in the universe but they will make fewer</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.120" end="00:28:47.790" style="s2">mistakes so machines will always you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.760" end="00:28:50.010" style="s2">know or outperform humans by you know by</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.790" end="00:28:51.660" style="s2">minimizing number of mistakes or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.010" end="00:28:54.660" style="s2">not just a number of mistakes machines</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.660" end="00:28:56.190" style="s2">do not make blunders so they get the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.660" end="00:28:58.350" style="s2">gravity of machines mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.190" end="00:28:59.730" style="s2">or inaccuracies right it&#39;s not as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.350" end="00:29:03.019" style="s2">know sometimes humans could do something</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.730" end="00:29:07.559" style="s2">really stupid have you ever looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.019" end="00:29:09.419" style="s2">the history of electric guitar no so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.559" end="00:29:11.159" style="s2">have these very weird players I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.419" end="00:29:14.639" style="s2">gonna riff off of your open versus</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.159" end="00:29:16.710" style="s2">closed games we&#39;re probably the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.639" end="00:29:18.090" style="s2">great electric guitarist was a guy named</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.710" end="00:29:20.220" style="s2">Charlie Christian but he was really</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.090" end="00:29:23.070" style="s2">playing the guitar and it happened to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.220" end="00:29:25.789" style="s2">electrified by the time we get to people</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.070" end="00:29:29.309" style="s2">like Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.789" end="00:29:30.840" style="s2">whatever we thought the vocabulary was</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.309" end="00:29:33.179" style="s2">that we were restricted to in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.840" end="00:29:35.370" style="s2">instrument they showed us that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.179" end="00:29:37.830" style="s2">dimensionality of play was so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.370" end="00:29:39.419" style="s2">greater than we had ever considered for</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.830" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">example by bringing the amplification</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.419" end="00:29:42.929" style="s2">into the instrument and making it part</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:45.330" style="s2">of the instrument or with Les Paul</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.929" end="00:29:47.639" style="s2">creating the instrument as the recording</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.330" end="00:29:49.950" style="s2">studio not just as the instrument and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.639" end="00:29:52.620" style="s2">eventually these become closed games but</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.950" end="00:29:55.080" style="s2">there is something about and to just fit</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.620" end="00:29:57.570" style="s2">with the theme of this series the search</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.080" end="00:29:59.129" style="s2">for a portal out of the closed game into</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.570" end="00:30:02.759" style="s2">a higher dimensional space where</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.129" end="00:30:04.769" style="s2">something else is available like people</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.759" end="00:30:06.899" style="s2">talk about hearing eddie van halen for</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.769" end="00:30:08.730" style="s2">the first time and their guitarist and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.899" end="00:30:10.769" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking i have no idea what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:15.720" style="s2">listening to how do those noises come</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.769" end="00:30:19.740" style="s2">from that man are there any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.720" end="00:30:21.629" style="s2">innovations like that that you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.740" end="00:30:23.580" style="s2">where computers can start looking for</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.629" end="00:30:26.669" style="s2">ways out of the closed systems into</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.580" end="00:30:30.450" style="s2">higher dimensions I don&#39;t think so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.669" end="00:30:33.179" style="s2">think machines will not be able in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.450" end="00:30:35.490" style="s2">foreseeable future if not indefinitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.179" end="00:30:37.019" style="s2">to understand how the transfer of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.490" end="00:30:40.110" style="s2">knowledge from one closed system to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.019" end="00:30:41.820" style="s2">another can machine ask questions yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.110" end="00:30:44.549" style="s2">they just don&#39;t know what questions are</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.820" end="00:30:47.309" style="s2">relevant well so I give this example</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.549" end="00:30:52.019" style="s2">quite a bit but there&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.309" end="00:30:54.269" style="s2">concept in pure mathematics of taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.019" end="00:30:56.759" style="s2">square roots of various objects where</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.269" end="00:30:58.379" style="s2">like with with real numbers it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.759" end="00:30:59.460" style="s2">clear what a square root should be but</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.379" end="00:31:01.980" style="s2">even when you get to the negative</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.460" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">numbers you you end up having to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.980" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">outside of the real numbers to answer a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">question about the square root of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">negative seven and you can take this</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:10.470" style="s2">square roots of rotations you can take</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:13.230" style="s2">the school</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.470" end="00:31:14.970" style="s2">determinants of matrices and you find</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.230" end="00:31:17.880" style="s2">these structures that nobody knew we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.970" end="00:31:20.039" style="s2">hiding there so one of the things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.880" end="00:31:22.530" style="s2">learned in pure mathematics is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.039" end="00:31:25.260" style="s2">there is a way of going from a closed</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.530" end="00:31:27.450" style="s2">system into a larger closed system and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.260" end="00:31:30.780" style="s2">that one moment the closed system</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.450" end="00:31:31.980" style="s2">reveals itself to be open is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.780" end="00:31:34.409" style="s2">something that you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.980" end="00:31:36.690" style="s2">no again as I am not sure it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.409" end="00:31:38.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a legitimate comparison because</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.789" end="00:31:56.070" style="s2">the day you know that this is there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.760" end="00:32:05.880" style="s2">disagreed with ugh Hardy wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.669" end="00:32:08.520" style="s2">chess is real mathematics but if a</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.559" end="00:32:17.429" style="s2">were the rules were artificial and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.539" end="00:32:19.500" style="s2">what it told you about was simply</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.429" end="00:32:22.049" style="s2">internal to the world but they said but</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.760" end="00:32:31.530" style="s2">based on your assumption so is this and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.520" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know the the again</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.530" end="00:32:36.570" style="s2">machines will always win not because</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:38.610" style="s2">they see the perfect solution again ten</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.610" end="00:32:42.570" style="s2">but because they make fewer mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.020" end="00:32:45.030" style="s2">right so there will be closer to</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.030" end="00:32:47.909" style="s2">what is much close or just close it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:51.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter so there will be always</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.909" end="00:32:52.890" style="s2">ahead so same with every other game so</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.030" end="00:32:54.539" style="s2">all you need is to provide machine with</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.890" end="00:32:57.090" style="s2">the rules and machines will start</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:03.960" style="s2">say that it&#39;s today alpha zero is still</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.400" end="00:33:06.840" style="s2">quite an exception most of the machines</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.960" end="00:33:09.270" style="s2">today 99 percent if not 99.9 percent</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.840" end="00:33:10.230" style="s2">they are doing not transformation but</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.230" end="00:33:14.909" style="s2">is still you know operating with human</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:17.100" style="s2">generated data but the future I&#39;ve no</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.909" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">doubt it&#39;s for alpha zero type computers</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.100" end="00:33:22.409" style="s2">you know they they will be it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:23.680" style="s2">like you know computer with AI</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.409" end="00:33:27.610" style="s2">algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.680" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">and the the it&#39;s there will require some</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.610" end="00:33:33.520" style="s2">form of human guidance it&#39;s I I always</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:35.950" style="s2">call this you know the future computer</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.520" end="00:33:38.260" style="s2">experts shepherds so they will be</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.950" end="00:33:41.410" style="s2">nudging the flocks off of intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:42.610" style="s2">algorithms one or another but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.410" end="00:33:45.460" style="s2">still you know they will still need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.610" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">be nudged so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s again moving</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.460" end="00:33:49.030" style="s2">from one system to another it&#39;s it&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.030" end="00:33:53.770" style="s2">will require human guidance what is very</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.210" end="00:33:57.820" style="s2">important for us to recognize is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.770" end="00:34:01.740" style="s2">our role percentage-wise is shrinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.820" end="00:34:04.630" style="s2">yeah but it doesn&#39;t mean that we become</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.740" end="00:34:06.700" style="s2">expendable so actually I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.630" end="00:34:08.679" style="s2">we&#39;re getting we could become even more</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.700" end="00:34:11.350" style="s2">important in this human collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.679" end="00:34:13.540" style="s2">because we will be deciding how these</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.350" end="00:34:16.149" style="s2">massive brute force yeah I worry they</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.540" end="00:34:19.000" style="s2">will be moved with a right or left or</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.149" end="00:34:20.770" style="s2">whatever up and down well if I&#39;m honest</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.000" end="00:34:23.350" style="s2">about that the way in which I receive</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.770" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">what you just said is that in the short</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.350" end="00:34:27.159" style="s2">term I think we become more important</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.179" end="00:34:29.320" style="s2">because the least interesting things are</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.159" end="00:34:31.870" style="s2">taken over by the computers and then if</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.320" end="00:34:33.840" style="s2">we&#39;re smart we invest in what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.870" end="00:34:38.020" style="s2">we do best which is often this act of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.840" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">brilliance induction opening a closed</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.020" end="00:34:43.360" style="s2">system into a larger one which</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:43.990" style="s2">temporarily opening it up and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.360" end="00:34:47.980" style="s2">exciting</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.990" end="00:34:51.879" style="s2">however I do feel that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.980" end="00:34:55.810" style="s2">short-term win for Humanity one short</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.879" end="00:34:58.300" style="s2">term to be well I worry that this is on</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.810" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">the order of decades not centuries it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.300" end="00:35:06.910" style="s2">you and me it&#39;s probably not a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:09.250" style="s2">short yeah it&#39;s look why do we go too</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.910" end="00:35:11.410" style="s2">far so this is again we you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.250" end="00:35:13.750" style="s2">strengths of humanity was always to to</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.410" end="00:35:14.980" style="s2">respond to the challenges that we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.750" end="00:35:18.070" style="s2">not I here now yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.980" end="00:35:21.790" style="s2">table right um I don&#39;t want asked you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:27.670" style="s2">spend time I would say waste our time</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.790" end="00:35:30.190" style="s2">debating what what can or may may happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.670" end="00:35:32.410" style="s2">may not happen 30 40 50 years from now</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.190" end="00:35:35.380" style="s2">we have challenges that we should</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.410" end="00:35:37.430" style="s2">address right now and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.380" end="00:35:41.420" style="s2">universities it&#39;s time for us to and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.430" end="00:35:43.069" style="s2">stand how we can maximize the the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.420" end="00:35:45.319" style="s2">benefits out of human machine</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.069" end="00:35:47.329" style="s2">collaboration well okay uh so I had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.319" end="00:35:49.400" style="s2">very funny interaction preparing for my</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.329" end="00:35:53.960" style="s2">interview with you today which is that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.400" end="00:35:57.170" style="s2">spoke to two brilliant young women one</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.960" end="00:35:58.839" style="s2">of whom just released 25,000 new stock</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.170" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">photos of people who don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.839" end="00:36:04.369" style="s2">generated by her AI she&#39;s a PhD from</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:07.130" style="s2">Berkeley the other of which is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.369" end="00:36:08.930" style="s2">brilliant musician but arguably also one</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.130" end="00:36:12.290" style="s2">of the world&#39;s most stunningly beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.930" end="00:36:14.329" style="s2">women as a supermodel and I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.290" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">the elo system that you use for chess</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.329" end="00:36:18.290" style="s2">can be used in any situation where if</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:20.839" style="s2">like if you asked well who would be who</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.290" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">would people find more beautiful person</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.839" end="00:36:24.680" style="s2">a or person B and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:26.540" style="s2">prediction so you could use an ela</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.680" end="00:36:28.970" style="s2">system and I asked my friend the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.540" end="00:36:32.030" style="s2">supermodel and name is Charlotte Kemp</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.970" end="00:36:35.150" style="s2">Muhl would you be willing to subject</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.030" end="00:36:38.150" style="s2">yourself to a Kasparov versus the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.150" end="00:36:40.839" style="s2">machine type competition where my other</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.150" end="00:36:43.549" style="s2">friend will attempt to generate</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.839" end="00:36:45.500" style="s2">photographs that are even more beautiful</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.500" end="00:36:51.410" style="s2">and we could try to figure out what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.170" end="00:36:54.740" style="s2">elo rating is for simply feminine beauty</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.410" end="00:36:58.220" style="s2">now that&#39;s a very different thing than a</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.740" end="00:36:59.990" style="s2">computational problem on the surface it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.220" end="00:37:02.359" style="s2">may be a computational problem under the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.990" end="00:37:05.210" style="s2">hood but what happened when I started</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.359" end="00:37:07.250" style="s2">looking through the friends catalogue of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.210" end="00:37:09.260" style="s2">stock photos is that I could see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.250" end="00:37:11.030" style="s2">you could very easily fall in love with</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.260" end="00:37:12.890" style="s2">the images that she&#39;d generated even</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.030" end="00:37:16.099" style="s2">though they correspond to no human being</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.890" end="00:37:17.809" style="s2">they were filled with emotion you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.099" end="00:37:19.940" style="s2">grace whatever you whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.809" end="00:37:22.069" style="s2">you associate most with being human and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.940" end="00:37:25.369" style="s2">yet she knew exactly how they&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.069" end="00:37:27.170" style="s2">generated from her neural Nets that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.369" end="00:37:32.089" style="s2">pretty disturbing in some ways would you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.170" end="00:37:34.430" style="s2">not say so it&#39;s you talking about images</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.089" end="00:37:37.970" style="s2">right still even still images still</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.430" end="00:37:39.079" style="s2">images now you need just for proper</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.970" end="00:37:41.240" style="s2">relations you need more than still</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.079" end="00:37:43.190" style="s2">images well that&#39;s true but you the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.240" end="00:37:44.750" style="s2">achieved she&#39;s able to animate a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.750" end="00:37:47.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that that&#39;s becomes</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.499" end="00:38:15.589" style="s2">come off the games in a credible fashion</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.470" end="00:38:16.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a date right what&#39;s the but look I</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.589" end="00:38:19.339" style="s2">do you know what you know what&#39;s here is</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.970" end="00:38:21.319" style="s2">that we&#39;ve associated various things</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.339" end="00:38:23.390" style="s2">with our humanity and I think your point</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.319" end="00:38:27.890" style="s2">about chess which I just think is great</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.390" end="00:38:29.690" style="s2">is don&#39;t make the mistake of holding</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.890" end="00:38:33.019" style="s2">those associations too tightly because</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.690" end="00:38:34.460" style="s2">the machines will let you know that some</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.019" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">of this is not having to do with being</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.460" end="00:38:39.769" style="s2">human at all yes it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.670" end="00:38:42.140" style="s2">decision-making process is not you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.769" end="00:38:44.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not just human prerogative forever</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.140" end="00:38:46.279" style="s2">right so it&#39;s yes we used to think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.539" end="00:38:48.470" style="s2">you know it&#39;s these machines could do</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.279" end="00:38:51.499" style="s2">all sorts of work but not you know not</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.470" end="00:38:53.150" style="s2">to challenge our cognitive skills right</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.499" end="00:38:55.789" style="s2">at the end of the day it&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.150" end="00:38:58.789" style="s2">difference so is this it&#39;s T it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.789" end="00:39:02.989" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s machines could could help us</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.789" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">in just making progress in in what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.989" end="00:39:10.579" style="s2">in in in the field of physical exercises</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:12.829" style="s2">or mental exercises do again it says</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.579" end="00:39:16.249" style="s2">it&#39;s if you look at the statistics is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.829" end="00:39:20.269" style="s2">that is this I think is the Mackenzies a</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.249" end="00:39:24.019" style="s2">report of 2016 u.s. job market show that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.269" end="00:39:27.769" style="s2">I know it&#39;s the only 4% of working</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.019" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">activities yes required medium human</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.769" end="00:39:33.109" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:35.480" style="s2">well 4% yeah so it means that for over</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.109" end="00:39:37.249" style="s2">decades we have been trained people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.480" end="00:39:39.499" style="s2">work like machine like machine and now</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.249" end="00:39:42.069" style="s2">now were shocked that many of these jobs</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.499" end="00:39:44.119" style="s2">they they are just you know they do my</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.069" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">presumably jobs they already dead they</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.119" end="00:39:47.900" style="s2">just don&#39;t know every repetitive job has</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:50.359" style="s2">that character but I see but it could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.900" end="00:39:54.140" style="s2">it repetitive jobs does not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.359" end="00:39:56.329" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a physical one</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.140" end="00:39:58.700" style="s2">it you don&#39;t know it look at ever wrote</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.329" end="00:40:01.579" style="s2">repetitive jobs you know it&#39;s your race</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.700" end="00:40:03.289" style="s2">radio it really easy ones intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.579" end="00:40:04.869" style="s2">right and and when people say oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.289" end="00:40:07.990" style="s2">but these many of these jobs there</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.869" end="00:40:09.849" style="s2">just in in grave danger right but you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.990" end="00:40:12.579" style="s2">know what it&#39;s thank you for managing</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.849" end="00:40:15.249" style="s2">radiology sure so this is yes you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.579" end="00:40:18.700" style="s2">we know that human machine collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.249" end="00:40:19.960" style="s2">right you know shows better results than</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.700" end="00:40:21.730" style="s2">either wanna do that either one</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.960" end="00:40:24.819" style="s2">individual so that means that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.730" end="00:40:26.859" style="s2">you will have some experts and from my</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.819" end="00:40:28.599" style="s2">experience in Aaron chess in combination</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.859" end="00:40:31.569" style="s2">of human plus machines right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.599" end="00:40:33.880" style="s2">need the strongest minds so the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.569" end="00:40:36.069" style="s2">talented players working with machine</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.880" end="00:40:39.009" style="s2">but someone who knows enough to give</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.069" end="00:40:40.809" style="s2">machines solace it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.009" end="00:40:42.549" style="s2">guide machine not interference memory</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.809" end="00:40:45.009" style="s2">superior knowledge so that&#39;s why you may</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.549" end="00:40:46.630" style="s2">not need a top professor but maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.009" end="00:40:48.759" style="s2">know an assistant professor maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.630" end="00:40:52.210" style="s2">experienced nurse - right - to work with</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.759" end="00:40:55.150" style="s2">this machine oh but I hear you know time</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.210" end="00:40:56.769" style="s2">and again thousands of jobs you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.150" end="00:40:58.569" style="s2">there will be at grave risk maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.769" end="00:41:01.690" style="s2">they&#39;ll be lost and it is - well-paid</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.569" end="00:41:03.940" style="s2">jobs yes but what is the what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.690" end="00:41:07.390" style="s2">other side of this well on this point</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.940" end="00:41:09.700" style="s2">the jobs will be lost but the cost goes</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.390" end="00:41:11.349" style="s2">down more people could have access to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.700" end="00:41:13.749" style="s2">that and when you look at the number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.349" end="00:41:16.450" style="s2">lives that can be saved yes in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.749" end="00:41:18.130" style="s2">country or especially in the third world</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.450" end="00:41:20.019" style="s2">countries developing countries yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.130" end="00:41:22.150" style="s2">so then you know all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.019" end="00:41:23.470" style="s2">understand that this it&#39;s while certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.150" end="00:41:26.470" style="s2">groups of people could be in danger</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.470" end="00:41:28.329" style="s2">because their computation worst and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.470" end="00:41:30.519" style="s2">and and and machines they bring in you</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.329" end="00:41:33.519" style="s2">know you know have a canal in our</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.519" end="00:41:35.499" style="s2">professional routine but as a humanity</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.519" end="00:41:37.749" style="s2">will always win well but isn&#39;t it weird</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.499" end="00:41:40.059" style="s2">how many of us are seeking drudgery that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.749" end="00:41:41.349" style="s2">we wish like you watch what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.059" end="00:41:42.910" style="s2">you liberate people and you find that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.349" end="00:41:44.680" style="s2">they go back to these games on their</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.910" end="00:41:46.630" style="s2">computers that they play repetitively</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.680" end="00:41:48.309" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.630" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">humans we had always thought we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.309" end="00:41:51.099" style="s2">to be liberated to do creativity but</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.799" style="s2">there&#39;s something terrifying about</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.099" end="00:41:57.579" style="s2">creativity and many of us actually seek</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.799" end="00:42:01.329" style="s2">repetitive activity which anesthetize is</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.579" end="00:42:03.369" style="s2">us and arguably we&#39;re happiest when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.329" end="00:42:05.859" style="s2">start behaving in a way that is machine</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.369" end="00:42:08.259" style="s2">like again but it&#39;s the it brings us</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.859" end="00:42:10.390" style="s2">back to us that bring us back one human</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.259" end="00:42:12.130" style="s2">yes because you know it&#39;s the you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.390" end="00:42:14.579" style="s2">it&#39;s instead of talking about killer</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.130" end="00:42:17.529" style="s2">robots to terminators metrics and other</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.579" end="00:42:18.840" style="s2">horrors produced by Hollywood so just</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.529" end="00:42:23.790" style="s2">you know it&#39;s your neighbors here</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.840" end="00:42:27.960" style="s2">so brainwashing yeah generations of pay</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.790" end="00:42:31.170" style="s2">no attention dynamic yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.960" end="00:42:34.980" style="s2">it&#39;s quite primitive yeah but it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.170" end="00:42:37.620" style="s2">why don&#39;t we talk about in about humans</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.980" end="00:42:39.360" style="s2">using modern technology yes HAARP other</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.620" end="00:42:41.250" style="s2">humans because humans still have</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.360" end="00:42:42.540" style="s2">monopolies for evil right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.250" end="00:42:44.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s and I think it&#39;s far more</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.540" end="00:42:46.230" style="s2">important now to understand how this</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.460" end="00:42:49.650" style="s2">modern technology that has been designed</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.230" end="00:42:51.270" style="s2">yes in theory to make ours better have</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.650" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">been have been would say it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.270" end="00:42:56.340" style="s2">used right to undermine the very</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:58.680" style="s2">foundation of the free world so what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.340" end="00:43:00.150" style="s2">that&#39;s a great opportunity to transition</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.680" end="00:43:01.710" style="s2">because if there&#39;s anything that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:03.990" style="s2">more interested in than talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.710" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">computers and poetry and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.990" end="00:43:08.310" style="s2">things it&#39;s this bizarre moment that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:10.770" style="s2">find ourselves in in the free world</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.310" end="00:43:13.170" style="s2">where I&#39;ve never seen anything like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.770" end="00:43:15.330" style="s2">in my life it appears that there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.170" end="00:43:16.980" style="s2">almost no adults left in the system it</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.330" end="00:43:18.510" style="s2">appears to me that there&#39;s almost no</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.980" end="00:43:20.910" style="s2">institution that really cares about</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.510" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">ground truth and it appears to me that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.910" end="00:43:26.790" style="s2">we are right now in the process of sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">of abandoning everything we&#39;d built up</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.790" end="00:43:33.570" style="s2">for the most trivial of reasons and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:35.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether you subscribe to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.570" end="00:43:37.800" style="s2">but the transformation of our country</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.400" end="00:43:39.480" style="s2">intellectually to me since slightly</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.800" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">before the election of Donald Trump to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.480" end="00:43:45.180" style="s2">the present moment has been the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:48.230" style="s2">unexpected singularity in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.180" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">ability to hold conversations to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.230" end="00:43:53.670" style="s2">what it is that we in fact hold in</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:55.620" style="s2">common our sense making apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.670" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">appears to have been broken down and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.620" end="00:44:01.050" style="s2">large number of people don&#39;t even seem</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:03.750" style="s2">to be aware of this and I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.050" end="00:44:06.630" style="s2">to explain how many different clusters</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.750" end="00:44:07.980" style="s2">of beliefs have now cropped up which</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.630" end="00:44:09.270" style="s2">appeared to be incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.980" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">communicating with each other you seen</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.270" end="00:44:16.110" style="s2">the same thing yes yes and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:18.990" style="s2">worrying about it for quite a while so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.110" end="00:44:21.060" style="s2">wrote the book winter is coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.990" end="00:44:25.320" style="s2">just you know before the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.060" end="00:44:28.410" style="s2">elections in 2016 and unfortunately it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.320" end="00:44:30.390" style="s2">is worrying nobody understood it no</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.410" end="00:44:32.460" style="s2">nobody wanted to hear this because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.390" end="00:44:35.310" style="s2">seemed that it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.460" end="00:44:36.750" style="s2">so far away yeah the book didn&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.310" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">Trump or Syria but you could read</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.750" end="00:44:41.210" style="s2">between the lines that is this because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:44.310" style="s2">really talked about Putin and about his</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.210" end="00:44:46.320" style="s2">threat to the to the free world so he is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.310" end="00:44:47.970" style="s2">warned the free world that is just it</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.320" end="00:44:49.620" style="s2">was just a matter of time before the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.970" end="00:44:53.130" style="s2">techniques that have been developed in</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.620" end="00:44:55.590" style="s2">Russia and tested in neighboring</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.130" end="00:44:58.530" style="s2">countries and in and in other European</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.590" end="00:45:00.680" style="s2">countries there&#39;s these techniques would</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.530" end="00:45:03.840" style="s2">be used to undermine American democracy</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.680" end="00:45:06.630" style="s2">and also I talked about the growing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.840" end="00:45:08.810" style="s2">vacuum in the world that was a result of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.630" end="00:45:12.180" style="s2">the free world led by the United States</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.810" end="00:45:14.730" style="s2">to depart from its leadership role after</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.180" end="00:45:16.320" style="s2">the end of the Cold War so it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.730" end="00:45:17.790" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to say it&#39;s everything is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.320" end="00:45:20.220" style="s2">about Donald Trump but when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.790" end="00:45:22.500" style="s2">the Donald Trump phenomenon it has roots</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.220" end="00:45:24.750" style="s2">well this is a it&#39;s a symptom it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.500" end="00:45:26.280" style="s2">symptom that somehow Trumpy now just is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.750" end="00:45:29.010" style="s2">demonstrated that the system was already</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.280" end="00:45:32.850" style="s2">so weak that is that it could it could</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.010" end="00:45:34.710" style="s2">have Torsen so unqualified to win</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.850" end="00:45:36.780" style="s2">elections by the rules I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.710" end="00:45:38.340" style="s2">it&#39;s yes was foreign interference with</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.780" end="00:45:40.350" style="s2">other thing about you big you&#39;re exactly</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.350" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">take the evolutionary metaphor was</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.120" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2">created and then suddenly there was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">creature that&#39;s but then that says</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:52.050" style="s2">before we go to Trump we should</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:54.660" style="s2">understand so why the system was so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.050" end="00:45:56.760" style="s2">know it was weak enough susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.660" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">susceptible yes just to to our to</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.240" end="00:49:20.369" style="s2">you know it required a new plan it did</p>

<p begin="00:49:29.010" end="00:49:34.500" style="s2">knew about it or a few years ago so in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:37.260" style="s2">1991 1992 it was America&#39;s role to start</p>

<p begin="00:49:37.260" end="00:49:42.690" style="s2">participation know Soviet units what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.569" end="00:49:44.430" style="s2">the plan and one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.690" end="00:49:46.380" style="s2">things was to address the reform of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.430" end="00:49:49.170" style="s2">United Nations because United Nations</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.380" end="00:49:52.380" style="s2">was built in 1945 as a success or fail</p>

<p begin="00:50:05.069" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">there in 1962 it came close with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.950" end="00:50:11.309" style="s2">Caribbean crisis but it was basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:14.730" style="s2">basically for a couple of weeks it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.309" end="00:50:16.740" style="s2">there was no real threat of war more</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.730" end="00:50:21.450" style="s2">three and and and global it amazingly</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.420" end="00:50:39.480" style="s2">world&#39;s most dangerous places and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.250" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">don&#39;t think about it that way because</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.480" end="00:50:44.369" style="s2">we&#39;ve had this period of stability that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:46.500" style="s2">has been a normal you you you get Europe</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.560" end="00:52:17.610" style="s2">recognized that for nearly half a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.750" end="00:52:19.500" style="s2">century there was an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.610" end="00:52:22.770" style="s2">you know of potential threat of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.500" end="00:52:25.260" style="s2">nuclear war and those who remember 1962</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.770" end="00:52:27.540" style="s2">crisis and Vietnam war so oh wow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.260" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">all over so why don&#39;t we just you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.540" end="00:52:31.140" style="s2">you celebrate why don&#39;t we get rich why</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:32.790" style="s2">don&#39;t we just do other things</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.140" end="00:52:34.920" style="s2">stop worrying to other rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.790" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">you know it&#39;s sometimes I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.920" end="00:52:37.770" style="s2">if the Soviet Union collapsed a year</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:39.750" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.770" end="00:52:41.580" style="s2">yeah probably Bush 41 could be reelected</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.750" end="00:52:43.170" style="s2">because I think one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.580" end="00:52:44.940" style="s2">Clinton you know won the elections is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.170" end="00:52:47.430" style="s2">not just Ross Perot which was important</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.940" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">factor but but but the Republicans lost</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.430" end="00:52:52.020" style="s2">that big heart so yeah whole war was</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">over so why do we need Bush and in an</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.020" end="00:52:57.960" style="s2">economy stupid motor right in one the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:53:00.120" style="s2">day where we turned inward exactly now</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.960" end="00:53:01.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s basically America was still</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.120" end="00:53:05.220" style="s2">there because it was the only superpower</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.650" end="00:53:08.550" style="s2">but it lost its you know its role as the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.220" end="00:53:11.820" style="s2">you know as the stabilizing factor</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.550" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">because look Clinton 1992 you know you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.820" end="00:53:17.760" style="s2">want elections in 2010 a year 2001</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:19.590" style="s2">general he walked away 1992 America was</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.760" end="00:53:22.590" style="s2">basically in the position to do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.590" end="00:53:24.480" style="s2">is make you know make any any any</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.590" end="00:53:27.660" style="s2">suggestions that others had no</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.480" end="00:53:30.090" style="s2">but to accept in 2001 early al-qaeda was</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.660" end="00:53:32.760" style="s2">ready to strike so that&#39;s its we miss</p>

<p begin="00:57:27.739" end="00:57:33.499" style="s2">unique and there Putin believes in only</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.079" end="00:57:35.420" style="s2">in power of money and he just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.499" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">at a point quite early in his presidency</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.420" end="00:57:40.759" style="s2">that money can buy anyone anything and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:43.219" style="s2">and that&#39;s the problem for this was a</p>

<p begin="00:58:25.790" end="00:58:30.860" style="s2">Stalin wanted to take over West Berlin</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.920" end="00:58:33.620" style="s2">it was it he he announced a blockade run</p>

<p begin="00:58:45.440" end="00:58:50.390" style="s2">survive and Stalin decided against</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.230" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">shooting shooting this plane so he knew</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.390" end="00:58:55.130" style="s2">that Harry Truman was not a man just due</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:57.550" style="s2">to that like exactly so and I said look</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.130" end="00:59:00.110" style="s2">Harry Truman faced</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.550" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">Joseph Stalin and this is Russia today</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.640" end="00:59:25.700" style="s2">horrible truth which is that in a weird</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.590" end="00:59:27.980" style="s2">way Putin appears to be relatively in my</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.700" end="00:59:29.780" style="s2">way of thinking one of the most skilled</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.980" end="00:59:32.990" style="s2">players left on the chessboard</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.780" end="00:59:34.970" style="s2">no I just I have to disagree please I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.990" end="00:59:36.350" style="s2">would defend the integrity of my game so</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.970" end="00:59:39.940" style="s2">Putin is not a chess player</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.350" end="00:59:43.130" style="s2">no sir sorry sir he&#39;s easy Napoletano</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.940" end="00:59:45.350" style="s2">its assists it&#39;s the Putin Putin doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.130" end="00:59:47.000" style="s2">create these opportunities he uses them</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.350" end="00:59:48.500" style="s2">so he grabs them okay let me say it</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.000" end="00:59:51.500" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.500" end="00:59:52.070" style="s2">Putin strengths is is is is a witness of</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.500" end="00:59:55.250" style="s2">the free world</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.070" end="00:59:57.530" style="s2">yes but the KGB had a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.250" end="01:00:00.560" style="s2">of know how it was resident within that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.530" end="01:00:02.619" style="s2">yeah but no how is fine but KGB and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.560" end="01:00:04.869" style="s2">has enormous amount of cash</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.619" end="01:00:07.029" style="s2">yes Vladimir Putin controls more money</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.869" end="01:00:08.589" style="s2">than any other individual in history</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.029" end="01:00:11.079" style="s2">richest richest man</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.589" end="01:00:13.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it he&#39;s when when is people say oh</p>

<p begin="01:00:16.930" end="01:00:20.759" style="s2">not the same kind of wealth that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.180" end="01:00:24.609" style="s2">know that&#39;s like a black gay or</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.759" end="01:00:26.829" style="s2">powerslam or bezels or wear because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.609" end="01:00:28.749" style="s2">all depends on him staying in power but</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.829" end="01:00:30.700" style="s2">when you look at the amount of money</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.749" end="01:00:32.380" style="s2">Vladimir Putin can move directly or</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.700" end="01:00:34.420" style="s2">indirectly you&#39;re probably talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.380" end="01:00:37.569" style="s2">something like a 1 trillion dollar</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.420" end="01:00:39.999" style="s2">system one trillion dollar yeah it just</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.569" end="01:00:42.579" style="s2">you you add Russian and no budget you</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.999" end="01:00:45.759" style="s2">add Russian so in a Russian hard</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.579" end="01:00:47.410" style="s2">currency reserves the fortunes of some</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.759" end="01:00:50.109" style="s2">of the top Russian oligarchs ok to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.410" end="01:00:52.839" style="s2">Putin but he&#39;s skilled he&#39;s ruthless</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.109" end="01:00:54.999" style="s2">he&#39;s a single decision maker and he has</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.839" end="01:00:57.940" style="s2">this level of control over resources yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.999" end="01:01:00.970" style="s2">there&#39;s no I know equal to that unless</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.940" end="01:01:02.490" style="s2">it&#39;s the Chinese no no it&#39;s yes more</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.970" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">power probably than seeds in pean</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.490" end="01:01:07.509" style="s2">relatively to can&#39;t to to to the country</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:09.009" style="s2">because seeds and beans resources are</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.509" end="01:01:11.859" style="s2">just incompatible to Putin what he</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.009" end="01:01:13.779" style="s2">farmers it&#39;s just China is much stronger</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.859" end="01:01:15.759" style="s2">than and I think seeds in pain and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.779" end="01:01:17.049" style="s2">Chinese Commons they&#39;re very happy to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.759" end="01:01:19.539" style="s2">see Putin creating these problems</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.049" end="01:01:20.650" style="s2">because it you know it helps them to</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.539" end="01:01:22.599" style="s2">shift their attention</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.650" end="01:01:24.249" style="s2">China is a strategic threat if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.599" end="01:01:25.809" style="s2">using chess line right long-term</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.249" end="01:01:27.910" style="s2">strategic threat okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.809" end="01:01:29.710" style="s2">so Putin is more of a tactical threat</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.910" end="01:01:31.299" style="s2">but right now this is you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.710" end="01:01:33.400" style="s2">this is a real threat because if your</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.299" end="01:01:36.039" style="s2">king is on the threat of being mated you</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.400" end="01:01:38.619" style="s2">guys think about long-term consequences</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.039" end="01:01:40.839" style="s2">of the endgame all right well so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.619" end="01:01:42.299" style="s2">hit another chest terminal and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.839" end="01:01:44.950" style="s2">pull the ripcord if it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.299" end="01:01:47.259" style="s2">there&#39;s a concept which not everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.950" end="01:01:49.210" style="s2">knows called zugzwang yes where where</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.259" end="01:01:50.980" style="s2">you are in a situation where you prefer</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.210" end="01:01:53.140" style="s2">not to have to move because anything you</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.980" end="01:01:55.390" style="s2">do actually put you in a word I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.140" end="01:01:58.029" style="s2">you have to move why do we keep acting</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.390" end="01:01:59.799" style="s2">as if we&#39;re in zugzwang yeah that&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.029" end="01:02:00.249" style="s2">me go back to what I said a few moments</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.799" end="01:02:03.099" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.249" end="01:02:05.349" style="s2">Putin strengths is our witness yes Putin</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.099" end="01:02:07.420" style="s2">is good at looking at opportunities like</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.349" end="01:02:09.279" style="s2">and then and he strikes he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.420" end="01:02:11.019" style="s2">create them but the moment he sees</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.279" end="01:02:13.059" style="s2">witness it&#39;s animal instinct you know he</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.019" end="01:02:15.400" style="s2">goes for kill right so why whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.059" end="01:02:15.750" style="s2">Putin&#39;s in Syria because America walked</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.400" end="01:02:17.580" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.750" end="01:02:19.080" style="s2">because I marry create vacuum there so</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.580" end="01:02:21.780" style="s2">when you look at the added global map</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.080" end="01:02:23.820" style="s2">why putting zero there because the free</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.780" end="01:02:25.770" style="s2">world you know blinked didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.820" end="01:02:28.470" style="s2">interfere and that&#39;s what we learned</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.770" end="01:02:31.320" style="s2">I hope actually I was wrong had to learn</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.470" end="01:02:34.230" style="s2">from the nineteen series it&#39;s the if we</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.320" end="01:02:38.190" style="s2">see rising dictatorship yes and and</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.880" end="01:15:02.860" style="s2">let&#39;s keep it super simple so that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.829" end="01:15:04.989" style="s2">can just stay on one point is that fair</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.860" end="01:15:09.340" style="s2">representation really I think that&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.989" end="01:15:12.130" style="s2">the way I think he he he had other</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.340" end="01:15:13.989" style="s2">impeachable offenses he knows so bet but</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.130" end="01:15:16.530" style="s2">your point was but if you stay win this</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.989" end="01:15:20.230" style="s2">battle because right now the moment you</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.530" end="01:15:22.750" style="s2">accused Trump of numerous crimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.230" end="01:15:24.849" style="s2">I believe he committed it will be very</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.750" end="01:15:26.889" style="s2">very easy for we can see the for that</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.849" end="01:15:30.400" style="s2">for for Trump&#39;s defenders to sort of to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.889" end="01:15:32.320" style="s2">to to sort of dilute it is Michael Carey</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.400" end="01:15:34.090" style="s2">that has that has to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.320" end="01:15:36.010" style="s2">corruption in the in the Democratic side</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.090" end="01:15:37.540" style="s2">because you can see</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.010" end="01:15:39.220" style="s2">that the New York Times and The</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.540" end="01:15:41.590" style="s2">Washington Post are not behaving as</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.220" end="01:15:43.420" style="s2">honest actors and it&#39;s very clear at the</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.590" end="01:15:46.630" style="s2">moment that they&#39;re not you have this</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.420" end="01:15:48.700" style="s2">different problem which is I can&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.630" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">I spent almost all my time criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.700" end="01:15:52.720" style="s2">the left not the right</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:55.690" style="s2">not because I think the right is okay it</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.720" end="01:15:59.040" style="s2">absolutely isn&#39;t but because if the left</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.690" end="01:16:02.950" style="s2">continues to pursue these petty</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.040" end="01:16:05.200" style="s2">transparent ridiculous mini propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.950" end="01:16:07.270" style="s2">operations we&#39;ve undercut our own</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.200" end="01:16:09.070" style="s2">credibility in any place the connections</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.270" end="01:16:12.010" style="s2">all the sudden what I hate most is</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.070" end="01:16:13.090" style="s2">hypocrisy and as this now you know in</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.010" end="01:16:16.000" style="s2">the next democratic debates</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.090" end="01:16:19.239" style="s2">I will hit one question yeah every every</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.000" end="01:16:22.390" style="s2">every demo really hopeful onstage if it</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.239" end="01:16:25.150" style="s2">was a simple yes or no will you will you</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.390" end="01:16:28.060" style="s2">authorize sell-off lethal weapons to</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.150" end="01:16:30.520" style="s2">Ukraine yes or no because you trumpet on</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.060" end="01:16:33.010" style="s2">traumas on trial for that will you or</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.520" end="01:16:35.770" style="s2">not I&#39;m afraid most of them will say no</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.010" end="01:16:37.420" style="s2">and that shows the hypocrisy that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.770" end="01:16:40.239" style="s2">Kenna&#39;s at the end of the day trans</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.420" end="01:16:43.020" style="s2">foreign policy just don&#39;t kill before</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.239" end="01:16:46.030" style="s2">that not so different from Obama&#39;s Trump</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.020" end="01:16:48.040" style="s2">the motivation is different but Obama</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.030" end="01:16:50.380" style="s2">retreated because of his beliefs it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.040" end="01:16:52.390" style="s2">like a ideological retreat Trump doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.380" end="01:16:54.430" style="s2">these things for profit but it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.390" end="01:16:55.750" style="s2">unfortunately not the outcome you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.430" end="01:16:58.300" style="s2">believe that Trump is under direct</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.750" end="01:16:59.830" style="s2">control of Putin or does it matter but</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.300" end="01:17:01.690" style="s2">that&#39;s okay that&#39;s it&#39;s I said</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.830" end="01:17:03.489" style="s2">for-profit yeah you know Trump is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.690" end="01:17:05.200" style="s2">Russian asset I said it many times yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.489" end="01:17:06.220" style="s2">and is it whether you understand it or</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.200" end="01:17:08.020" style="s2">not it&#39;s another story</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.220" end="01:17:10.090" style="s2">Trump is Russian asset I don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.020" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">to know all the details your point is</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.090" end="01:17:14.980" style="s2">that the incentive structures I grew up</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:17.050" style="s2">on the Soviet Union and I just I can I</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.980" end="01:17:19.989" style="s2">can repeat it time and again</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.050" end="01:17:22.000" style="s2">I met enough KGB Colonels yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.989" end="01:17:24.160" style="s2">know how these people look at you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.000" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">so the way pit buton looks at Trump is</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.160" end="01:17:29.350" style="s2">the way KGB handler looks at his asset</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">he looks at NorCal at McCrone with a</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.350" end="01:17:33.580" style="s2">contempt it&#39;s a contempt because he he</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.840" end="01:17:36.070" style="s2">believes he can by anyone on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.580" end="01:17:38.110" style="s2">unfortunately they like failed to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.070" end="01:17:40.480" style="s2">everybody but the way he looks at Trump</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.110" end="01:17:43.630" style="s2">the way they act yeah it&#39;s this it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.480" end="01:17:45.640" style="s2">this this this you know this wry smile</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.630" end="01:17:47.560" style="s2">and this is not a smirk</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.640" end="01:17:49.060" style="s2">Trump is an asset he believes the Trump</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.560" end="01:17:51.460" style="s2">for some reasons will do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.060" end="01:17:53.560" style="s2">and by the way they were it&#39;s the Trump</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.460" end="01:17:55.840" style="s2">you know it&#39;s when people say how can</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.560" end="01:17:58.080" style="s2">you say that now okay yeah I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.840" end="01:18:01.240" style="s2">when the Democratic Party asserts that</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:03.790" style="s2">Donald trum buddy inside of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.240" end="01:18:05.620" style="s2">traditional left-of-centre media or</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.790" end="01:18:07.630" style="s2">political apparatus starts to assert</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.620" end="01:18:09.580" style="s2">that Donald can Trump is under the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.630" end="01:18:12.250" style="s2">direct control as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.580" end="01:18:14.110" style="s2">incentive control like even to advance</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.250" end="01:18:16.180" style="s2">at the end of the ages trumpets look</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.110" end="01:18:18.730" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually my point what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.180" end="01:18:23.050" style="s2">trying to say is there&#39;s a problem right</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.730" end="01:18:25.480" style="s2">now with we can&#39;t form a sense making we</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.050" end="01:18:28.090" style="s2">came from a story that enough of us can</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.480" end="01:18:30.490" style="s2">participate in just start actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.090" end="01:18:32.710" style="s2">dealing with our real problems we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.490" end="01:18:34.540" style="s2">just in freefall and whether or not I</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.710" end="01:18:37.270" style="s2">sign on to everything that you say about</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.540" end="01:18:39.100" style="s2">Trump or not I know that if you and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.270" end="01:18:41.470" style="s2">have enough time we can at least figure</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.100" end="01:18:45.160" style="s2">out what we agree on but agree on what</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.470" end="01:18:46.990" style="s2">the theories are we have another common</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.160" end="01:18:48.430" style="s2">denominator so that&#39;s as clear this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.990" end="01:18:49.780" style="s2">from our conversation you may disagree</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.430" end="01:18:51.820" style="s2">with many things but at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.780" end="01:18:53.680" style="s2">day we know where we are where we stand</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.820" end="01:18:55.480" style="s2">so our disagreements would be more of a</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.680" end="01:18:58.510" style="s2">tactical not a strategical character yes</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.480" end="01:19:00.160" style="s2">so what I&#39;m concerned about is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.510" end="01:19:02.110" style="s2">right now we&#39;re a sitting duck because</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.160" end="01:19:04.450" style="s2">we&#39;re not actually be there there are no</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.110" end="01:19:06.160" style="s2">adults that I can find anywhere on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.450" end="01:19:08.530" style="s2">stage because again it says it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.160" end="01:19:10.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s the again America has to</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.530" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">reinvent itself I mean it has to yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.780" end="01:19:14.500" style="s2">consider what is America&#39;s role and this</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:15.880" style="s2">is and again it says you go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.500" end="01:19:17.590" style="s2">democratic debates they talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.880" end="01:19:19.480" style="s2">things that they they might be very</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.590" end="01:19:20.620" style="s2">important it says I understand you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.480" end="01:19:22.300" style="s2">you should talk about health care you</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.620" end="01:19:24.820" style="s2">should talk about other issues that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.300" end="01:19:27.340" style="s2">important you know for America long term</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.820" end="01:19:28.720" style="s2">but right now you have the foundation of</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.340" end="01:19:31.870" style="s2">the Republic is in jeopardy</p>
