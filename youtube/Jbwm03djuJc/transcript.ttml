<p begin="00:00:16.660" end="00:00:22.210" style="s2">meaning crisis so last time we had begun</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.390" end="00:00:25.000" style="s2">to take a look at the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.210" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">that was occurring in the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.000" end="00:00:30.820" style="s2">Mediterranean around the time of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:35.170" style="s2">advent of what was going to become</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.820" end="00:00:38.500" style="s2">Christianity of course this figures upon</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.170" end="00:00:40.180" style="s2">the person of Jesus of Nazareth a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.500" end="00:00:43.720" style="s2">controversial figure to say the least</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.180" end="00:00:47.320" style="s2">and as I said I&#39;m not going to endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.720" end="00:00:49.000" style="s2">to claim to give the absolute or exhaust</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.320" end="00:00:51.879" style="s2">his account of this extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">individual but instead I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.879" end="00:00:58.780" style="s2">and do what I&#39;ve done before which is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:01:02.140" style="s2">show how what he did contributed to our</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.780" end="00:01:05.649" style="s2">understanding of meaning and wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.140" end="00:01:09.009" style="s2">how that eventually pushed the history</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.009" end="00:01:17.380" style="s2">so we were talking about one of the core</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.270" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">messages of Jesus Jesus seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.380" end="00:01:25.150" style="s2">understood himself or at least those</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:28.150" style="s2">around him understood him as Kairos if</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.150" end="00:01:30.610" style="s2">you remember that&#39;s a turning point in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.150" end="00:01:34.990" style="s2">the course of history because as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.610" end="00:01:37.000" style="s2">spoke before the Israelites and by this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.990" end="00:01:40.080" style="s2">time they were known as the Jews had</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.000" end="00:01:42.250" style="s2">developed the psycho technology of</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.710" end="00:01:51.909" style="s2">turning points and Jesus saw himself as</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:54.369" style="s2">such a Kairos whether or not he saw</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.909" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">himself as the Kairos that was known as</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:01.990" style="s2">controversial I don&#39;t need that for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.140" end="00:02:06.420" style="s2">purposes of my argument it seems though</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.990" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">that he had a sense of himself as deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.420" end="00:02:14.079" style="s2">participating in the way in which God</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">was directing and involving himself in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.079" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">the course of history if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">the model of God we talked about when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:24.569" style="s2">talked about the ancient Israelites the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">god of the exodus is a God who is</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.660" end="00:02:47.050" style="s2">participating in its flow and Jesus of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.650" end="00:02:49.390" style="s2">Nazareth saw himself as having an</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.050" end="00:02:53.350" style="s2">especially deep participation such that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.390" end="00:02:55.930" style="s2">he felt himself to be at one with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.350" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">God who is capable of altering the</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.640" end="00:03:20.230" style="s2">about before makes sense we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:22.840" style="s2">about how this participatory knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.230" end="00:03:25.660" style="s2">a process in which you&#39;re coupled right</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.840" end="00:03:27.850" style="s2">you&#39;re neither making it or be made by</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.660" end="00:03:32.110" style="s2">it but it&#39;s this reciprocal revelation</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.850" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">in which you are you are making it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.110" end="00:03:36.100" style="s2">it is making you the way you participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:37.780" style="s2">in your culture the way you participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.100" end="00:03:40.420" style="s2">in your language the way you participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.780" end="00:03:43.000" style="s2">in history and you know this not by</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.420" end="00:03:45.790" style="s2">gathering beliefs but the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.000" end="00:03:49.050" style="s2">yourself is fundamentally transformed</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.790" end="00:03:52.930" style="s2">and so Jesus understood this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.050" end="00:03:55.750" style="s2">participation this his participation in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:03:59.650" style="s2">God as the disclosing of this profound</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.750" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">kind of love and we began talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.650" end="00:04:08.050" style="s2">this the kinds of love that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:11.080" style="s2">experience and how love is something</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.050" end="00:04:15.160" style="s2">that deeply transforms who we are and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.080" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">our salience landscape our character we</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.160" end="00:04:19.570" style="s2">talked about the Greeks have three terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.830" end="00:04:21.370" style="s2">and it&#39;s helpful because by this time</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.570" end="00:04:24.430" style="s2">the New Testament is being run written</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.370" end="00:04:26.020" style="s2">in Greek it&#39;s helpful to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.430" end="00:04:29.310" style="s2">these Greek terms so there&#39;s eros which</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.020" end="00:04:31.660" style="s2">is the love of being one with something</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.310" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">right and it can be just you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:36.940" style="s2">drinking water so I become one with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:39.100" style="s2">but of course it could become what has</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.940" end="00:04:40.930" style="s2">become more commonly known as becoming</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.100" end="00:04:45.669" style="s2">one with someone through sexual you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.930" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">Ioan erotic love then there&#39;s valia</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.669" end="00:04:51.030" style="s2">that&#39;s at the core of philosophy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:52.259" style="s2">this is the love that is born of right</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:04:57.570" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.259" end="00:05:00.940" style="s2">so I Ross is consumptive making one with</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.570" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">Phi Lea is cooperation we work together</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.940" end="00:05:06.729" style="s2">we work together and a lot of of how we</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:11.889" style="s2">succeed as human beings is by the way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.729" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">work together but Jesus starts to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.889" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">emphasize a new kind of love agape and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:20.220" style="s2">then this is not the love of consumption</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.449" style="s2">or cooperation this is the love of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.220" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">creation it&#39;s the love that God is</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:33.639" style="s2">way God is an ongoing creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.229" end="00:05:35.770" style="s2">open future so God is creating the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.639" end="00:05:38.770" style="s2">future is creating the historical</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.940" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">kind of love that creates persons so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:53.349" style="s2">main metaphor for agape if you remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:56.949" style="s2">is the way a parent loves a child you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.349" end="00:05:58.780" style="s2">don&#39;t love a child because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.949" end="00:06:01.479" style="s2">consume it in some way that&#39;s hideous</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.780" end="00:06:02.830" style="s2">and vicious you don&#39;t love your child</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.479" end="00:06:05.770" style="s2">when you bring it home from the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.830" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s a great friend to you it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.770" end="00:06:10.180" style="s2">can cooperate it can&#39;t do that at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.490" style="s2">it&#39;s fact it&#39;s not even a a person it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.490" end="00:06:18.550" style="s2">agent in fact it&#39;s exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.150" end="00:06:21.970" style="s2">you love it precisely because by loving</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.550" end="00:06:27.400" style="s2">that non person you turn it into a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.970" end="00:06:30.220" style="s2">person this is the powerful creative</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.639" end="00:06:41.789" style="s2">another being we can transform that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.650" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">being from a non person into a person a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.789" end="00:06:49.620" style="s2">person that could enter into a community</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.269" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">right they are in a sense consuming the</p>

<p begin="00:10:13.550" end="00:10:23.509" style="s2">because of the way you have internalized</p>

<p begin="00:10:23.509" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the child&#39;s perspective view so</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.730" end="00:10:31.310" style="s2">you can see for the child it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:33.889" style="s2">egocentric and Freud picked up on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.310" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">that in but I think he also twisted it</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.889" end="00:10:37.819" style="s2">in this sense it&#39;s very our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:40.899" style="s2">to our parents and please listen to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.819" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">very carefully is in that sense erotic</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.899" end="00:10:48.649" style="s2">right in the sense that we are consuming</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:51.110" style="s2">them we are internalizing them we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.649" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">becoming one with them now I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.110" end="00:10:53.930" style="s2">erotic in the sense that Freud</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">ultimately meant because Freud thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.930" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">that all of that was always a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:02.029" style="s2">experience I think that&#39;s too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.470" style="s2">but I think there is insight here but</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.029" end="00:11:05.870" style="s2">take a look at this from the parents</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.470" end="00:11:08.360" style="s2">perspective from the parents perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.870" end="00:11:10.970" style="s2">the person giving agape it is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.360" end="00:11:13.499" style="s2">egocentric at all in fact there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.970" end="00:11:16.899" style="s2">nothing that will more</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.499" end="00:11:19.990" style="s2">challenge your egocentric orientation</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.899" end="00:11:22.749" style="s2">that everything is moving this way then</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.990" end="00:11:25.569" style="s2">having a child if you&#39;re a good parent</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.749" end="00:11:27.670" style="s2">and of course we all vary in how good we</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.569" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">are as parents I have been privileged to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.670" end="00:11:35.290" style="s2">be a parent myself but what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:40.300" style="s2">you are no longer the center of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.290" end="00:11:41.740" style="s2">salience landscape the child is because</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.300" end="00:11:46.779" style="s2">the child is absolutely dependent upon</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.740" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">you do you see this is the Metanoia of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.779" end="00:11:53.079" style="s2">agape I mean the metaphor is turning but</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:55.329" style="s2">the problem with that metaphor is all</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.079" end="00:11:56.889" style="s2">turning is still egocentric you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.329" end="00:12:00.519" style="s2">think of the turning this way the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.889" end="00:12:03.399" style="s2">turning is I go from being egocentric to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.519" end="00:12:05.079" style="s2">being centered on someone else and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.399" end="00:12:08.050" style="s2">I&#39;m actually centered on is I&#39;m very I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.079" end="00:12:11.889" style="s2">centered on the process right of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.050" end="00:12:14.410" style="s2">creating a person like God but not</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.889" end="00:12:16.929" style="s2">egocentric like oh my god it&#39;s like I am</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.410" end="00:12:19.660" style="s2">participating in that a gothic process</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.929" end="00:12:19.959" style="s2">that made me the the agape that precedes</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.959" end="00:12:26.499" style="s2">flows through me and transforms me as</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.499" end="00:12:33.730" style="s2">I believe was he was offering a teaching</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.749" end="00:12:37.149" style="s2">so that all people could experience this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.730" end="00:12:40.600" style="s2">not just individually personally with</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.149" end="00:12:43.769" style="s2">their own parents but in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.600" end="00:12:49.749" style="s2">relationship to God we could all</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.769" end="00:12:54.910" style="s2">experience this fundamental turning such</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.749" end="00:13:00.369" style="s2">that we become vessels through which</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.910" end="00:13:02.110" style="s2">agape creates other human beings so</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.369" end="00:13:07.179" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen of course and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:09.100" style="s2">see this in the epistles of John is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.179" end="00:13:14.549" style="s2">Christian the Christian community starts</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.100" end="00:13:14.549" style="s2">to understand this capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.860" end="00:13:55.690" style="s2">this process that we participated and we</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.200" end="00:14:15.550" style="s2">this is a radical idea as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.230" end="00:14:19.870" style="s2">last time this is going to give the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.550" end="00:14:23.130" style="s2">Christians a psycho technology they a</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.950" end="00:14:34.930" style="s2">of course what I mean is what Christians</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.860" end="00:14:39.970" style="s2">can do is they can offer all the non</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.860" end="00:15:41.580" style="s2">to be the the key idea and it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.950" end="00:15:45.180" style="s2">it carries with it some kind of notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.580" end="00:15:46.950" style="s2">of a sacrificial element to it and again</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.180" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of controversy around this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.950" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">and we have to be careful not to read</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">too much of Paul into this but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">talk about Paul in a few minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:04.770" style="s2">agape has a sacrificial element to it in</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:59.490" style="s2">Jesus emphasizes forgiveness as central</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.490" end="00:17:04.250" style="s2">things we should remember and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.830" end="00:17:07.820" style="s2">controversial to say is Jesus does not</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.560" end="00:17:21.480" style="s2">like that and we&#39;ll talk about that but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.800" end="00:17:25.830" style="s2">when asked how to obtain forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.480" end="00:17:27.870" style="s2">from God this opportunity of radically</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.500" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">them it&#39;s okay that&#39;s not the core idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:18:00.380" style="s2">of forgiveness the the court of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:04.850" style="s2">of forgiveness doesn&#39;t depend on your</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.380" end="00:18:09.580" style="s2">contrition the degree to which you are</p>

<p begin="00:18:17.570" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">forgiveness is when somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:25.400" style="s2">slighted us and the relationship has</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:27.470" style="s2">been damaged and we have to act</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.400" end="00:18:31.420" style="s2">agape clay in order to re-establish the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.470" end="00:18:34.970" style="s2">relationship but in a very real sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.420" end="00:18:39.170" style="s2">all a gothic love is forgiving love</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.970" end="00:18:41.540" style="s2">because it is giving before right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.170" end="00:18:43.880" style="s2">person that is receiving the love can in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.540" end="00:18:48.190" style="s2">any way be said to have earned it so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.880" end="00:18:54.430" style="s2">this idea that are we we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.190" end="00:18:58.670" style="s2">sacrificially extending the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.430" end="00:19:03.740" style="s2">individuals to redirect their own</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.670" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">history experience their own Kairos was</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.740" end="00:19:09.830" style="s2">often captured by Jesus in the famous</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.260" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">language of being born again you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.830" end="00:19:17.510" style="s2">dying and you&#39;re being born again this</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.510" end="00:19:30.170" style="s2">orientation your entire way of being now</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:33.050" style="s2">the tragedy that befall --zz the Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.170" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">movements at least some of them because</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.050" end="00:19:36.560" style="s2">not all the movements care about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">this is again something that many people</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.560" end="00:19:43.299" style="s2">don&#39;t realize they</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:45.429" style="s2">are many elements of the the early</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.299" end="00:19:47.080" style="s2">followers of Jesus communities that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.429" end="00:19:50.590" style="s2">don&#39;t care about his death they only</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.080" end="00:19:56.649" style="s2">care about his teaching but of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.590" end="00:19:59.620" style="s2">Jesus does die and that has a profound</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.649" end="00:20:02.769" style="s2">effect on some of these movements and</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.620" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">again this is hard to state anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.769" end="00:20:07.720" style="s2">clearly or anything that we could have</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">any great confidence in but somehow his</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.720" end="00:20:15.639" style="s2">death exemplifies the sacrificial</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:25.320" style="s2">forgiveness that right that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.639" end="00:20:25.320" style="s2">core of God as agape somehow Jesus death</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.250" end="00:20:35.610" style="s2">enables people to internalize that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:35.610" style="s2">sacrificial love and empowers them to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.809" end="00:20:47.860" style="s2">transform other human beings now there</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.730" end="00:20:50.500" style="s2">of course is resistance to the Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.860" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">movements into Jesus it&#39;s plausible that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.500" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">his death was due to the fact that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:00.190" style="s2">was angering and upsetting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:02.230" style="s2">people we see this as a right as</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.190" end="00:21:08.409" style="s2">something similar to what confronted</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.230" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">Socrates one of the people that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.409" end="00:21:14.350" style="s2">have been an early persecutor is a guy</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">by the name of Saul now Saul&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.350" end="00:21:22.169" style="s2">interesting person he&#39;s both a Jew and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:22.169" style="s2">Roman citizen</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.710" end="00:21:30.239" style="s2">at a time when these two groups of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.629" end="00:21:34.289" style="s2">people are quite antagonistic towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.239" end="00:21:36.509" style="s2">each other there has been already wars</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.289" end="00:21:40.259" style="s2">between the Romans and the Jews a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.509" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">one was about to come to major Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.259" end="00:21:44.489" style="s2">revolts so the relationship is a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:49.409" style="s2">tense one filled with a lot of tension</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.489" end="00:21:55.259" style="s2">and this is reflected within this person</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.409" end="00:21:58.109" style="s2">himself he seems to have he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.259" end="00:22:01.409" style="s2">have integrated these two disparate and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.109" end="00:22:04.649" style="s2">warring aspects of his personality and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.409" end="00:22:10.649" style="s2">his identity together around a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.649" end="00:22:19.129" style="s2">commitment to law organized rules of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.649" end="00:22:19.129" style="s2">behavior and conduct and he sees the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.820" end="00:22:24.029" style="s2">Jesus movements the followers of Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.229" end="00:22:25.109" style="s2">they&#39;re not in fact in fact just to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.029" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">point out something they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.109" end="00:22:30.200" style="s2">initially called the followers of Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:34.909" style="s2">initially call the followers of the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.200" end="00:22:38.999" style="s2">because Jesus had presented a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.909" end="00:22:40.259" style="s2">aka a it&#39;s see the word way is so</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.999" end="00:22:43.889" style="s2">wonderful because it doesn&#39;t just mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.259" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">method it it&#39;s not just some procedures</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.889" end="00:22:49.710" style="s2">it&#39;s also an affordance of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:53.909" style="s2">going to move into the future it is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.710" end="00:22:56.970" style="s2">new orientation so Jesus is the way in</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.909" end="00:23:00.929" style="s2">which we can experience the Kairos of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.970" end="00:23:03.479" style="s2">metanoia and become forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.929" end="00:23:09.269" style="s2">individuals who are constantly forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.479" end="00:23:13.799" style="s2">Agathe CLE to others in Paul so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.269" end="00:23:18.599" style="s2">seems to see these people right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.799" end="00:23:22.909" style="s2">their their language of agape and their</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.599" end="00:23:26.580" style="s2">adoration of Jesus as deeply threatening</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.909" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">to his Jewish heritage and also to Roman</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.580" end="00:23:36.690" style="s2">order and so he becomes involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">persecution of the followers of the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">the time that he&#39;s involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:43.980" style="s2">persecution that they start being called</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:46.200" style="s2">actually as an insult</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.980" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">initially Christians the followers of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.200" end="00:23:54.300" style="s2">Christ what means The Anointed One and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:57.150" style="s2">so he&#39;s involved in persecuting them</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.300" end="00:23:59.660" style="s2">he&#39;s there the first time he&#39;s mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.150" end="00:24:05.430" style="s2">in the Bible he&#39;s there when the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.660" end="00:24:09.390" style="s2">Christian is martyred Stephen Stephen is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.430" end="00:24:11.310" style="s2">talking about this message and the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.390" end="00:24:14.490" style="s2">gets angered and they stoned him</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.310" end="00:24:16.590" style="s2">and Saul gathers every saul basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.490" end="00:24:20.420" style="s2">holds everybody&#39;s coats so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.590" end="00:24:20.420" style="s2">more effectively stone Stephen to death</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.380" end="00:24:27.150" style="s2">so Saul becomes deeply involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.300" end="00:24:32.370" style="s2">and he he gets basically a writ a letter</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.150" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">an official letter to travel to Damascus</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.370" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">and round up these so-called Christians</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.320" end="00:24:45.840" style="s2">and bring them in for prosecution and on</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:50.100" style="s2">the road he has what I think we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.840" end="00:24:55.070" style="s2">call a transformative experience he</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.100" end="00:24:58.590" style="s2">relates it himself and a couple places</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.070" end="00:25:01.860" style="s2">it&#39;s also represented third-person and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.590" end="00:25:03.660" style="s2">the book of Acts and there&#39;s differences</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.860" end="00:25:06.510" style="s2">in it as there always is in something</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.660" end="00:25:08.910" style="s2">that has a mythological element to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.510" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2">again where myth doesn&#39;t mean fable</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.910" end="00:25:16.350" style="s2">where myth means trying to present a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">profound pattern but he&#39;s struck by a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.350" end="00:25:20.370" style="s2">bright light and of course this is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:21.900" style="s2">metaphor of enlightenment and we know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.370" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">the transformative experiences often</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.900" end="00:25:30.030" style="s2">involve this experience of radical super</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:32.210" style="s2">salience often tremendous light then he</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.030" end="00:25:35.570" style="s2">is struck to the ground by it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.210" end="00:25:39.780" style="s2">overwhelming experience and then a voice</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.570" end="00:25:43.680" style="s2">speaks to him and says why why it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.780" end="00:25:45.180" style="s2">Saul why do you persecute me and Saul</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.680" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">says who are you lord</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.180" end="00:25:48.930" style="s2">Lord ease into title for God Lord is</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:52.140" style="s2">anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.930" end="00:25:54.330" style="s2">as some important higher status than you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.140" end="00:25:55.920" style="s2">and the experience carries with it that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.330" end="00:25:57.030" style="s2">on to normativity that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.920" end="00:25:59.310" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.030" end="00:26:02.370" style="s2">he Saul has the sense that he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.370" end="00:26:07.140" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.890" end="00:26:13.890" style="s2">who are you and the voice says I am</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.140" end="00:26:14.700" style="s2">Jesus who you persecute and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.890" end="00:26:19.080" style="s2">we need to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.700" end="00:26:21.870" style="s2">I mean Saul is blinded by this light and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.080" end="00:26:24.450" style="s2">encountering this voice right and we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.870" end="00:26:26.160" style="s2">think about Plato&#39;s metaphor here of as</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.450" end="00:26:29.730" style="s2">we encounter these things were often</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.160" end="00:26:33.420" style="s2">blinded by the light but what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.730" end="00:26:38.310" style="s2">understand is this engenders in Saul a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.420" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">deep deep inner conflict and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.310" end="00:26:43.260" style="s2">when you read his biography as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:45.240" style="s2">already painted here you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.260" end="00:26:48.860" style="s2">his experience of inner conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.240" end="00:26:53.220" style="s2">really profound and this reminds us</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.860" end="00:26:55.890" style="s2">again it&#39;s it&#39;s analogous but different</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.220" end="00:26:57.750" style="s2">of Plato&#39;s concerned with inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.890" end="00:27:00.030" style="s2">the way inner conflict reveals the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.750" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">psyche but as whereas Plato is going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.030" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">develop a scientific theory of inner</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:09.390" style="s2">conflict Saul is going to undergo a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:12.180" style="s2">transformative experience because of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.390" end="00:27:15.630" style="s2">this inner conflict it is going to Riven</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.180" end="00:27:19.920" style="s2">him to his core because how can it be</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.630" end="00:27:22.260" style="s2">that he hasn&#39;t had this transformative</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.920" end="00:27:27.930" style="s2">experience this awakening experiences</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.260" end="00:27:31.190" style="s2">more real from the very being that he</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.930" end="00:27:36.660" style="s2">was persecuting how can he reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.190" end="00:27:39.810" style="s2">these together he&#39;s actually he travels</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.660" end="00:27:43.230" style="s2">to Antioch and he actually gets taken in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.810" end="00:27:46.350" style="s2">by the very people he was going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.230" end="00:27:48.690" style="s2">persecute do you see this this is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.350" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">forgiveness the very people he was going</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">to persecute take him in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.730" end="00:28:00.139" style="s2">so the people that he was going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.259" end="00:28:03.350" style="s2">destroy are actually responsible for his</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.139" end="00:28:05.350" style="s2">care and under their care his sight is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.350" end="00:28:08.389" style="s2">restored</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.350" end="00:28:11.539" style="s2">what&#39;s all this pointing to again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.389" end="00:28:20.029" style="s2">pointing to right he&#39;s at war with agape</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.539" end="00:28:23.690" style="s2">itself and we all are like we all are we</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.029" end="00:28:27.799" style="s2">have a very tough time and this is part</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.690" end="00:28:30.769" style="s2">of the message of Jesus and John and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.799" end="00:28:34.840" style="s2">Paul at least to my mind we have a tough</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.769" end="00:28:41.960" style="s2">time acknowledging the reality of agape</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.840" end="00:28:45.500" style="s2">we like to create personal fables of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.960" end="00:28:51.379" style="s2">we are self-made and self-directed and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.500" end="00:28:56.019" style="s2">self secure and self-sustaining when</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.379" end="00:28:56.019" style="s2">agape challenges that in a profound way</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.879" end="00:29:07.299" style="s2">so Saul goes into the desert to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.740" end="00:29:11.330" style="s2">and this is always a biblical</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.299" end="00:29:16.460" style="s2">mythological paradigm for a process of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.330" end="00:29:20.450" style="s2">undergoing radical reflection and when</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.460" end="00:29:22.970" style="s2">he comes out he has gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.450" end="00:29:27.379" style="s2">radical transformative experience so</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.970" end="00:29:29.809" style="s2">he&#39;s had this higher state of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.379" end="00:29:32.690" style="s2">consciousness this visionary experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.809" end="00:29:35.059" style="s2">he then experiences agape from the very</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.690" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">people he was persecuting he goes into</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.059" end="00:29:39.470" style="s2">the desert and when he comes back he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:41.090" style="s2">new person he&#39;s gone through a radical</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.470" end="00:29:42.490" style="s2">transformative experience and we know</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.090" end="00:29:47.379" style="s2">that because he&#39;s changed his name</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.490" end="00:29:47.379" style="s2">changed his name from Saul to Paul</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.850" end="00:30:02.750" style="s2">and he has a radical message it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.030" end="00:30:02.750" style="s2">powerful message he comes to present</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.840" end="00:30:10.970" style="s2">agape and one of the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">passage of famous passages in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.970" end="00:30:19.650" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably heard it at some point</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:25.080" style="s2">it&#39;s often misread weddings people read</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.650" end="00:30:31.430" style="s2">this passage often at weddings and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.080" end="00:30:31.430" style="s2">I think are misinterpreting it because</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.270" end="00:30:38.310" style="s2">what Paul&#39;s talking about is Anna Gothic</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.150" end="00:30:40.380" style="s2">spiritual kind of love now there should</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.310" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">it definitely be that aspect in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.380" end="00:30:45.060" style="s2">romantic relationship but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:48.660" style="s2">romantic relationships typically are</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.060" end="00:30:51.300" style="s2">understood by most people as venues in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.660" end="00:31:01.740" style="s2">which a Coptic love is the primary focus</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.300" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">let me read the passage to you so Paul</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.740" end="00:31:09.330" style="s2">begins by saying and now I will show you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:13.290" style="s2">the most excellent way so he&#39;s showing</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.330" end="00:31:14.910" style="s2">you the most excellent way this is and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.290" end="00:31:17.670" style="s2">notice the word excellent the way in</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.910" end="00:31:19.830" style="s2">which we can most radically go through</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.670" end="00:31:23.400" style="s2">transformation and grow I&#39;ll show you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.830" end="00:31:28.130" style="s2">the most excellent way now he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.400" end="00:31:30.420" style="s2">gonna make an argument like Plato</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.130" end="00:31:32.280" style="s2">instead what he&#39;s going to do is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.420" end="00:31:34.910" style="s2">going to he&#39;s going to present</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.280" end="00:31:38.310" style="s2">everything from the framework of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.910" end="00:31:41.250" style="s2">participatory kind of knowing that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.310" end="00:31:43.920" style="s2">he begins if I so he&#39;s not making an</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.250" end="00:31:48.590" style="s2">argument he&#39;s talking about what his</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.920" end="00:31:52.680" style="s2">very identity how his identity is being</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.590" end="00:31:56.940" style="s2">informed and transformed by its</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.680" end="00:31:59.340" style="s2">conformity to a gothic love if I speak</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.940" end="00:32:01.110" style="s2">in the tongues of men and angels but</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:02.400" style="s2">have not love I am only a resounding</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.110" end="00:32:06.090" style="s2">gong</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.400" end="00:32:07.650" style="s2">clanging cymbal if I have the gift of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.090" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">prophecy and can fathom all mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.650" end="00:32:11.520" style="s2">and all knowledge and if I have faith</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:13.470" style="s2">that can move mountains but have not</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.520" end="00:32:15.450" style="s2">love I am nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.470" end="00:32:17.280" style="s2">notice all the language here this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.450" end="00:32:23.370" style="s2">participatory language this is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.280" end="00:32:25.140" style="s2">language of knowing by identifying if I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.370" end="00:32:27.240" style="s2">give all I possess to the poor and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.140" end="00:32:29.550" style="s2">surrender my body to the flames because</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.240" end="00:32:29.910" style="s2">Christians are starting to be burnt all</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.550" end="00:32:33.210" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.910" end="00:32:37.310" style="s2">but I have not love I gain nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.210" end="00:32:40.410" style="s2">notice this language it&#39;s very radical</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.310" end="00:32:43.020" style="s2">love is patient love is kind it does not</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.410" end="00:32:44.760" style="s2">envy it does not boast now this of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.020" end="00:32:47.640" style="s2">course is not romantic love because</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.760" end="00:32:51.090" style="s2">romantic love does it experience envy</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.640" end="00:32:54.840" style="s2">and jealousy it is not proud it is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:58.170" style="s2">rude it is not self-seeking it is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:33:01.620" style="s2">easily angered it keeps no record of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.170" end="00:33:04.610" style="s2">wrongs love does not delight in evil but</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.620" end="00:33:06.870" style="s2">rejoices with the truth it always</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.610" end="00:33:09.270" style="s2">protects always trusts always hopes</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.870" end="00:33:11.850" style="s2">always persevere those are the those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.270" end="00:33:15.450" style="s2">the features you need in order to help</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.850" end="00:33:18.030" style="s2">and afford someone coming into</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.450" end="00:33:20.150" style="s2">personhood love never fails</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.030" end="00:33:22.590" style="s2">now we think what are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.150" end="00:33:25.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in so many relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.590" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">they fail that&#39;s because you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.590" end="00:33:37.730" style="s2">of this as romantic love that love does</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:42.930" style="s2">fail what he means is agape can&#39;t fail</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.730" end="00:33:46.020" style="s2">we are always born from and always have</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.930" end="00:33:51.930" style="s2">to give birth to agape or personhood</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.930" end="00:33:55.470" style="s2">are prophecies they will cease where</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.940" end="00:33:57.210" style="s2">there are tongues they will be stilled</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.470" end="00:34:00.900" style="s2">where there is knowledge it will pass</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.900" end="00:34:06.810" style="s2">understand like what what are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:09.600" style="s2">about here before we know in part and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.810" end="00:34:12.649" style="s2">prophesy in part but when perfection</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.600" end="00:34:14.090" style="s2">comes perfection here meaning completion</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.649" end="00:34:19.370" style="s2">the Emperor</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.090" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">disappears and and people like what and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.370" end="00:34:27.710" style="s2">so he gives a metaphor one we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:30.110" style="s2">elsewhere when I was a child I talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.710" end="00:34:32.510" style="s2">like a child I thought like a child I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.110" end="00:34:36.550" style="s2">reasoned like a child when I became a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.510" end="00:34:39.110" style="s2">man I put child tyldus ways behind me</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.550" end="00:34:40.460" style="s2">okay so when you&#39;re a kid you have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.110" end="00:34:42.590" style="s2">particular identity you have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.460" end="00:34:46.460" style="s2">particular salience landscape right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.590" end="00:34:47.570" style="s2">things really really matter to you in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.460" end="00:34:52.310" style="s2">certain way we talked about this when we</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.570" end="00:34:54.920" style="s2">talked about software so when you become</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.310" end="00:34:57.860" style="s2">an adult right your world becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.920" end="00:35:00.200" style="s2">radically reoriented what is salient and</p>

<p begin="00:40:19.150" end="00:40:23.710" style="s2">why Jesus will say his for this</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.410" end="00:40:35.470" style="s2">lives in me right this is knowing by</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.930" end="00:41:07.510" style="s2">in under romantic relationship precisely</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.180" end="00:41:09.940" style="s2">because you are so bound to this person</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.109" end="00:42:11.430" style="s2">see the inner conflict in Paul was very</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.410" end="00:42:16.030" style="s2">profound he comes up against the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.430" end="00:42:17.589" style="s2">that many of us encounter Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.030" end="00:42:19.329" style="s2">talked about this with a crazy and</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:48.460" style="s2">describes it Paul Paul uses the language</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.390" end="00:42:51.190" style="s2">of like somebody in the midst of a civil</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.150" end="00:43:11.380" style="s2">what&#39;s he what&#39;s he so it conflicted</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.190" end="00:43:13.450" style="s2">about but Paul comes up with a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.380" end="00:43:16.450" style="s2">of course it&#39;s gonna be a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.450" end="00:43:17.800" style="s2">right he&#39;s he he&#39;s in the Israelite</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.230" end="00:44:11.140" style="s2">new Paul the Paul of love who feels</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.020" end="00:44:13.810" style="s2">connected and he sees he sees the old</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.810" end="00:44:17.410" style="s2">is the new man is trying to be born from</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.640" end="00:44:20.100" style="s2">the old man and so we we have picked</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.410" end="00:44:25.109" style="s2">this has become endemic to our culture</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.210" end="00:44:37.060" style="s2">up with this such we tell</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.480" end="00:45:10.220" style="s2">here&#39;s where I think the danger of</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.809" end="00:45:30.799" style="s2">because again I&#39;m trying to advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.670" end="00:45:32.690" style="s2">Christianity because we have to</p>

<p begin="00:45:37.970" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">understand the meaning crisis so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.410" end="00:45:50.809" style="s2">got this idea that God has two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:53.869" style="s2">to him or herself one part is God</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.809" end="00:45:58.819" style="s2">represents law and justice and order and</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.819" end="00:46:05.029" style="s2">stand in judgment we have somehow failed</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.489" end="00:46:08.150" style="s2">we have not lived up to the moral</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.150" end="00:46:13.369" style="s2">look the court made a good point about</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.730" end="00:46:17.239" style="s2">this morality demands nothing less than</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.369" end="00:46:19.039" style="s2">perfection from you you have to be</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.039" end="00:46:27.049" style="s2">written courageous and none of us can</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.470" end="00:46:30.920" style="s2">ever meet that standard now I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.049" end="00:46:37.099" style="s2">need to we need to balance that with</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.920" end="00:46:41.170" style="s2">compassion and love but what Paul is</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.099" end="00:46:46.009" style="s2">seeing is he&#39;s saying well God is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.170" end="00:46:49.999" style="s2">perfectly just and therefore we fail to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.009" end="00:46:55.999" style="s2">meet that standard and therefore legally</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.999" end="00:47:00.140" style="s2">we are condemned to death but yet God</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.999" end="00:47:02.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t just a judge God is also the a</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.750" end="00:47:10.990" style="s2">and so what he does is he takes the</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.990" end="00:47:15.590" style="s2">sacrificial because we&#39;ve talked about</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.590" end="00:47:24.109" style="s2">love and he gives it to this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.540" end="00:47:28.760" style="s2">Jesus sacrificed himself in order to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.109" end="00:47:33.980" style="s2">satisfy God&#39;s demand for justice so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.760" end="00:47:37.250" style="s2">God was capable of really loving us now</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.980" end="00:47:39.800" style="s2">there and and you know and and how that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.250" end="00:47:42.230" style="s2">Redemption model works out there&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.230" end="00:47:46.910" style="s2">and and whether or not we should</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:58.060" style="s2">relevant right is that within this</p>
