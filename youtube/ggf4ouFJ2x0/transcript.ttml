<p begin="00:00:04.910" end="00:00:09.200" style="s2">what about eating plants since there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.130" end="00:00:10.490" style="s2">also live organisms if we&#39;re gonna kill</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.200" end="00:00:12.230" style="s2">a plant to eat we&#39;re going to kill an</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.490" end="00:00:13.580" style="s2">animal to eat or is it still the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.230" end="00:00:15.200" style="s2">fundamental truth that we have to kill</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.580" end="00:00:17.980" style="s2">to eat and it&#39;s all the same are we</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.200" end="00:00:20.750" style="s2">still being specious to you know pick</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.980" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2">killing plants over animals and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.750" end="00:00:25.250" style="s2">there&#39;s actually some core distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:27.470" style="s2">here that are really worth making</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.250" end="00:00:29.929" style="s2">there&#39;s an evolutionary purpose for pain</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.470" end="00:00:33.320" style="s2">and that really the ethic that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.929" end="00:00:36.440" style="s2">looking at here is cause no harm or</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.320" end="00:00:38.420" style="s2">cause as little harm as possible to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.440" end="00:00:41.719" style="s2">point of view of a sentient experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.420" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">right shattering a rock apart if the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.719" end="00:00:44.890" style="s2">rock doesn&#39;t feel anything isn&#39;t an act</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:47.030" style="s2">of violence even though there was harm</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.890" end="00:00:48.649" style="s2">from one point of view but the rock</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.030" end="00:00:52.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t experiencing as far as we know</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.649" end="00:00:54.770" style="s2">about rocks experiencing harm so when we</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.610" end="00:00:56.059" style="s2">say cause no harm or cause the least</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.770" end="00:00:58.070" style="s2">amount of harm possible it&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.059" end="00:01:01.910" style="s2">capable of experiencing that harm right</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.070" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an evolutionary purpose</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.910" end="00:01:07.220" style="s2">for pain which is to be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:10.819" style="s2">away from something harmful to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.220" end="00:01:12.920" style="s2">organism okay so in all animals our</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.819" end="00:01:14.690" style="s2">sensory nerves nerves that take in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.920" end="00:01:15.920" style="s2">information and our motor nerves are</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.690" end="00:01:17.660" style="s2">nerves that can then respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.920" end="00:01:19.340" style="s2">information are intimately tied and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.660" end="00:01:23.179" style="s2">actually co-evolved going up the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.340" end="00:01:24.830" style="s2">evolutionary ladder and so notice that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.179" end="00:01:26.690" style="s2">whenever there&#39;s a pain response it will</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.830" end="00:01:28.970" style="s2">always trigger a motor response of one</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.690" end="00:01:30.649" style="s2">of two kinds so either you touch</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.970" end="00:01:33.080" style="s2">something hot or sharp and you move away</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.649" end="00:01:34.940" style="s2">from it or you have a sprained ankle and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.080" end="00:01:36.770" style="s2">you make sure not to step on it or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.940" end="00:01:39.170" style="s2">move into it but the purpose of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.770" end="00:01:40.940" style="s2">pain is to protect the the organism</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.170" end="00:01:42.679" style="s2">because of some response capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.940" end="00:01:45.289" style="s2">that response capacity involves our</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.679" end="00:01:46.369" style="s2">movement capacity right so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.289" end="00:01:48.039" style="s2">place where plants and animals</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.369" end="00:01:51.739" style="s2">fundamentally differ plants don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.039" end="00:01:53.300" style="s2">real-time movement capacity right they a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.739" end="00:01:54.950" style="s2">sunflower can track the Sun over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.300" end="00:01:56.149" style="s2">course of a day very slowly but they</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.950" end="00:01:58.580" style="s2">don&#39;t have the ability to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.149" end="00:02:00.530" style="s2">something harmful or to stop moving in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.580" end="00:02:02.599" style="s2">some way that&#39;s harmful to them and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.530" end="00:02:04.429" style="s2">there&#39;s no evolutionary purpose for pain</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.599" end="00:02:05.830" style="s2">for them and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.429" end="00:02:08.989" style="s2">understand that the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.830" end="00:02:10.819" style="s2">experiencing pain it&#39;s physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.989" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">mediated and it requires a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.819" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">so in us the pain process is mediated</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.030" end="00:02:19.209" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">a acetylcholine crossing synaptic gaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.209" end="00:02:23.650" style="s2">producing an opiate response you know in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">adrenal and sympathetic responses</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.650" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of energy required to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:29.709" style="s2">experience pain and that was only</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">selected for because it was advantageous</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.709" end="00:02:33.790" style="s2">that the creatures who experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:35.080" style="s2">moved away from harm better or didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.790" end="00:02:36.459" style="s2">move into harm better so they they</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.080" end="00:02:38.140" style="s2">actually got through reproduce better</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.459" end="00:02:41.110" style="s2">and natural selection selected for their</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.140" end="00:02:43.329" style="s2">ability to feel pain right when if a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.110" end="00:02:44.860" style="s2">tree or a plant the key to how they can</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.329" end="00:02:46.690" style="s2">gather energy from sunlight and none of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.860" end="00:02:48.519" style="s2">the other animals can has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.690" end="00:02:50.230" style="s2">their ability to be rooted and be able</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.519" end="00:02:52.870" style="s2">to gather a huge amount of nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.230" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">from the soil and to be able to support</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.870" end="00:02:57.430" style="s2">this huge base of foliage that can do</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:59.049" style="s2">all of this photo reception right and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.430" end="00:03:00.910" style="s2">because of that they give up the ability</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.049" end="00:03:02.440" style="s2">for movement and with it there really is</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.910" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2">no evolutionary purpose for pain</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.440" end="00:03:06.569" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been selected for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:09.430" style="s2">the first thing the second thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.569" end="00:03:11.829" style="s2">when we look in other animals we see in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.430" end="00:03:13.930" style="s2">their nervous system opiate receptors on</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.829" end="00:03:16.090" style="s2">their neurons which have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.930" end="00:03:19.209" style="s2">chemistry of modulating the pain process</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.090" end="00:03:21.849" style="s2">and we see that on every animal all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.209" end="00:03:24.160" style="s2">way down to hinge valve creatures like</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.849" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">clams and they all have the same kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.160" end="00:03:27.639" style="s2">of opiate structures that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:29.380" style="s2">indicate the same kinds of pain</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.639" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">processes because they have an ability</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.380" end="00:03:33.010" style="s2">to respond and the clam is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:34.359" style="s2">most simple one which is they can close</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.010" end="00:03:35.769" style="s2">up if there&#39;s something potentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.359" end="00:03:37.419" style="s2">harmful that means they have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.769" end="00:03:38.709" style="s2">experience harm right experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.419" end="00:03:42.310" style="s2">something subjectively and they can open</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.709" end="00:03:44.349" style="s2">in response to positive stimuli or at</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.310" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">least a lack of negative stimuli in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.349" end="00:03:49.359" style="s2">plant kingdom we don&#39;t see anything like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:51.299" style="s2">in opiate kind of chemistry and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.359" end="00:03:55.380" style="s2">see anything response wise like that now</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.299" end="00:03:58.389" style="s2">the book the secret life of plants and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.380" end="00:03:59.260" style="s2">you know a number of books and studies</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.389" end="00:04:01.209" style="s2">that have been done that showed that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.260" end="00:04:03.220" style="s2">plants do show some kind of electrical</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.209" end="00:04:04.870" style="s2">response to being cut or to other plants</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.220" end="00:04:06.760" style="s2">being cut or burned in their presence</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.870" end="00:04:12.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean plants have no response</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.760" end="00:04:15.069" style="s2">capacity but their response capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.549" end="00:04:17.560" style="s2">very very limited relative to animals</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.069" end="00:04:19.269" style="s2">response capacity and so the main kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.560" end="00:04:20.470" style="s2">of thing is if a plant is being cut it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.269" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">can&#39;t stop that from happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.470" end="00:04:24.849" style="s2">cannot move away from it can&#39;t pull into</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">its turtle shell can&#39;t close its clam</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.849" end="00:04:29.650" style="s2">shell can&#39;t what it can do is it can add</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.650" end="00:04:34.180" style="s2">area to be able to stop the loss of sap</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.050" end="00:04:36.340" style="s2">right and so when we see the electrical</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.180" end="00:04:38.380" style="s2">responses galvanic responses in plants</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.340" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">we see that they&#39;re responding and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">can answer amorphize that and call it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:45.010" style="s2">plant screaming but we don&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">any basis to to suspect that the plant</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.010" end="00:04:48.970" style="s2">is having a subjective experience of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">pain does this mean that plants have no</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.010" end="00:04:54.760" style="s2">this is actually at the edge of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.620" style="s2">scientific knowledge we don&#39;t know most</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.760" end="00:04:59.260" style="s2">neuroscientists say no plants don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.660" end="00:05:10.539" style="s2">pain or kind of suffering process</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:13.810" style="s2">because they couldn&#39;t respond to it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.539" end="00:05:16.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t show those signs so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.810" end="00:05:19.060" style="s2">major distinction right in the in in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.630" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">process of saying hey if I&#39;m taking a</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:31.650" style="s2">indications we have indicate no and even</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.350" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">if so in a radically different way right</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.650" end="00:05:36.970" style="s2">the other thing that&#39;s worth noting is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:39.330" style="s2">that even if there was some pain or</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.970" end="00:05:42.700" style="s2">suffering that the plant experienced</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.330" end="00:05:45.460" style="s2">when we are eating animals the animals</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.700" end="00:05:47.020" style="s2">had to eat plants and they there&#39;s some</p>
