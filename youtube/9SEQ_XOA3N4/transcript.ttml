<p begin="00:00:42.860" end="00:00:47.390" style="s2">been inspired by Peters reflections that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.050" end="00:00:49.549" style="s2">beauty is found in communitas and they</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:12.950" style="s2">here with you all is developing</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.780" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">experiencing a more rich mythology so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.870" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">that&#39;s why I called the series sensing</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:32.510" style="s2">the new myth as I am wanting to sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:34.550" style="s2">into what is an artful expression that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.510" end="00:01:37.150" style="s2">wants to happen through me that will</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.550" end="00:01:39.650" style="s2">beautify the world around me and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.150" end="00:01:40.490" style="s2">Andrew I&#39;d love to hear from you some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.650" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">the thoughts at the edge of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.490" end="00:01:47.210" style="s2">thinking like what is beauty really</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">and how are have you been reinventing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.210" end="00:01:55.240" style="s2">for yourself lately okay well first of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">all thank you very much for inviting me</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.240" end="00:02:01.940" style="s2">Tyson and thank you I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:04.420" style="s2">Timothy you said beauty is the your</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.940" end="00:02:07.310" style="s2">compass or your core and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.420" end="00:02:10.459" style="s2">that&#39;s just absolutely perfect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.310" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">absolutely I feel the same way I feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.459" end="00:02:15.530" style="s2">that beauty is the compass and the core</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.060" style="s2">not just my compass in the core but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.530" end="00:02:22.700" style="s2">compass in the core so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">exactly right and I also agree with was</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.700" end="00:02:27.290" style="s2">it Jordan who said that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:29.150" style="s2">no longer up to the task like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.290" end="00:02:32.230" style="s2">culture is falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.150" end="00:02:34.849" style="s2">and this is why there&#39;s so much ugliness</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.230" end="00:02:36.950" style="s2">so I&#39;m just gonna ramble here a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.849" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">bit about you know my thoughts on beauty</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.950" end="00:02:42.769" style="s2">and also the denial of beauty and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.840" style="s2">gonna start with that because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.769" end="00:02:48.610" style="s2">think we can understand beauty unless we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.840" end="00:02:51.019" style="s2">can understand what beauty is not and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.610" end="00:02:53.780" style="s2">should also say that this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.019" end="00:02:56.150" style="s2">the genesis of this conversation comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.780" end="00:02:59.090" style="s2">from some discussions I&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:03:05.859" style="s2">with genre Vicky and Christopher and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.090" end="00:03:08.180" style="s2">master Pietro on my podcast and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.859" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">inspired me to to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.180" end="00:03:14.780" style="s2">subject and also Peter who posted</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.690" end="00:03:19.220" style="s2">something from this wonderful Korean</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.780" end="00:03:23.319" style="s2">philosopher named Han I can&#39;t pronounce</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.220" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">this first part of his name but called</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.319" end="00:03:28.970" style="s2">called not reinvented Beauty called</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:31.370" style="s2">saving Beauty right and so I read this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.970" end="00:03:34.669" style="s2">and this inspired this article which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.370" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">why I was invited here so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.669" end="00:03:37.790" style="s2">interesting how all of these people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.769" style="s2">contributed to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.790" end="00:03:44.750" style="s2">you know the genesis of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.769" end="00:03:46.489" style="s2">conversation already and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.750" end="00:03:48.139" style="s2">things that me and John and Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.489" end="00:03:50.569" style="s2">Kristoff we&#39;re talking about was there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.139" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">this chorus always right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.569" end="00:03:55.239" style="s2">this chorus of voices you know in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:58.099" style="s2">minds and all around us and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.239" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">classical theatre you have a chorus and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.099" end="00:04:02.989" style="s2">the chorus is informing you and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:04.639" style="s2">choruses is is creating you know is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.989" end="00:04:07.819" style="s2">coming through you so it&#39;s never and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.639" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">never you like beauty is not an isolated</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.819" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">event it&#39;s always it always has a chorus</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">it always has a course behind it if that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:19.099" style="s2">makes any sense so first I want to just</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">talk about what I what I think beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.099" end="00:04:28.610" style="s2">not and what is the denial of beauty in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:31.699" style="s2">our culture and the hijacking of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.610" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">say beauty to be something else</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.699" end="00:04:37.580" style="s2">you know entirely so Hagel has this term</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">called the beautiful soul and he did not</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:41.810" style="s2">mean that in a flattering sense he meant</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:43.009" style="s2">that is in a sarcastic sort of insulting</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.810" end="00:04:48.439" style="s2">sense he says somebody who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.009" end="00:04:50.599" style="s2">beautiful soul is really you know he</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.439" end="00:04:52.699" style="s2">meant that this person was was was not</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.599" end="00:04:54.649" style="s2">really in touch with some something they</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.699" end="00:04:57.409" style="s2">were they were they were faking it they</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.649" end="00:05:01.610" style="s2">were putting on a front or a persona or</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.409" end="00:05:05.210" style="s2">a moralistic you know interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.610" end="00:05:06.619" style="s2">beauty so so so they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.210" end="00:05:07.939" style="s2">faking this kind of beauty so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.619" end="00:05:10.159" style="s2">that&#39;s the beautiful soul</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.939" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">and the beautiful soul is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.159" end="00:05:14.719" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s like a kind of uglies and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:16.759" style="s2">ugliness because beauty is not just</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.719" end="00:05:19.639" style="s2">being pretty or being cute or being nice</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.759" end="00:05:22.159" style="s2">or not this facade or the sexiness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.639" end="00:05:26.089" style="s2">it also has to have rough rough edges</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.159" end="00:05:28.969" style="s2">and one of the things that Hans says in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.089" end="00:05:31.789" style="s2">his essay is he talks about smoothness</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.969" end="00:05:34.550" style="s2">how how this culture interprets you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.789" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">Beauty as being smooth the smooth right</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:39.529" style="s2">whereas actual Beauty is a bit rough it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:47.479" style="s2">has rough edges I know I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.529" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just pretty so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.479" end="00:05:50.809" style="s2">it&#39;s because there&#39;s some gravity</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:52.039" style="s2">because there&#39;s some depth because</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.809" end="00:05:54.559" style="s2">there&#39;s not only light there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.039" end="00:05:56.569" style="s2">contrast of light and darkness there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.559" end="00:05:58.399" style="s2">not only life there&#39;s the meditation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.569" end="00:06:01.339" style="s2">death you know you can&#39;t have beauty</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.399" end="00:06:03.830" style="s2">that is divorced from let&#39;s say that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.339" end="00:06:07.519" style="s2">darker others are the the lunar or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.830" end="00:06:11.180" style="s2">the sadness or the tragic or that kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.519" end="00:06:13.249" style="s2">of thing you know so so beauty is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.180" end="00:06:15.439" style="s2">involved in the tragic aspect of life as</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.249" end="00:06:18.919" style="s2">well as being the vital and celebratory</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.439" end="00:06:21.559" style="s2">aspect to play so I think what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.919" end="00:06:23.599" style="s2">not beauty is is the smooth and I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.559" end="00:06:27.949" style="s2">thinking the product you know when</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.599" end="00:06:29.809" style="s2">something becomes a product it loses for</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.949" end="00:06:32.689" style="s2">me its its sense of beauty because</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.809" end="00:06:37.099" style="s2">beauty isn&#39;t a unique instance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.689" end="00:06:40.819" style="s2">something that appears from nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.099" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">if so I made this little list and on my</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.819" end="00:06:45.889" style="s2">list I had beautiful Souls cuteness the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:47.599" style="s2">smooth the product and then I had porn</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.889" end="00:06:50.509" style="s2">if occation which is a word I learned</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.599" end="00:06:52.339" style="s2">from Alexander Bart and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.509" end="00:06:54.139" style="s2">just porn you know I mean the porn of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.339" end="00:06:56.339" style="s2">the total poor notification of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.139" end="00:06:59.459" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.339" end="00:07:01.769" style="s2">and this means that that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.459" end="00:07:03.629" style="s2">everything becomes a sort of porn</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.319" end="00:10:09.229" style="s2">and in totalitarian societies you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.689" end="00:10:12.169" style="s2">this you know you see this Imperial</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.339" end="00:10:25.899" style="s2">thing I wrote for for the denial of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.229" end="00:10:29.269" style="s2">beauty was noise it just pure pure noise</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.899" end="00:10:31.220" style="s2">there&#39;s so much noise enos in our minds</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.329" end="00:10:53.460" style="s2">culture is a denial you know of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.970" end="00:10:57.510" style="s2">in my estimation</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.460" end="00:11:00.600" style="s2">so the next thing so that&#39;s my list</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.510" end="00:11:02.310" style="s2">which I wrote this morning about what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.600" end="00:11:03.690" style="s2">a denial of beauty because I think we</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.690" end="00:11:08.610" style="s2">approach what is beauty and actually we</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.860" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">should define it actually I think we</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.649" end="00:11:19.410" style="s2">should consider it a kind of we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.110" end="00:11:21.330" style="s2">we should approach it with a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.330" end="00:11:25.500" style="s2">Vicki&#39;s terminology so I&#39;m I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.730" end="00:11:27.570" style="s2">trying to define beauty here I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.500" end="00:11:31.589" style="s2">to give you propositions that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.570" end="00:11:32.820" style="s2">play with some of them you know or you</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.589" end="00:11:34.380" style="s2">know come from you know my own</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.649" end="00:11:48.540" style="s2">has a sense of a veil there&#39;s a veil to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:50.850" style="s2">beauty right in other words there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.540" end="00:11:56.070" style="s2">something hidden it&#39;s not explicit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.850" end="00:11:58.200" style="s2">not all on the surface it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.070" end="00:12:00.209" style="s2">makes it deep right which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.200" end="00:12:02.250" style="s2">opposite of the kind of you know porn if</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.209" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">ocation where you have you know wax</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.250" end="00:12:07.290" style="s2">bodies with their genitals exposed you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:08.580" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s not really beauty you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.290" end="00:12:10.920" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.580" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">perversion of beauty and again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.920" end="00:12:18.600" style="s2">want to talk you know in moralistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:21.720" style="s2">terms but but the erotic for example it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.600" end="00:12:22.980" style="s2">is when we say the erotic we feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.720" end="00:12:26.640" style="s2">something very different than we talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.980" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">when we talk about porn because because</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.640" end="00:12:32.220" style="s2">so what is erotic is is is this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:33.860" style="s2">quality of beauty I think and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.220" end="00:12:38.040" style="s2">deeper quality of beauty which is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.860" end="00:12:40.740" style="s2">explicit always right it eludes us it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.040" end="00:12:47.100" style="s2">tricks us you know it&#39;s got a quality of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.740" end="00:12:49.170" style="s2">being a bit of a trickster so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.100" end="00:12:50.820" style="s2">that you know I think you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.170" end="00:12:52.860" style="s2">denial of beauty is also the denial of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.820" end="00:12:55.800" style="s2">poetry the poche and I don&#39;t mean poetry</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.860" end="00:12:58.529" style="s2">just written poetry I mean I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.800" end="00:13:06.410" style="s2">poetry a meaning a complex sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.529" end="00:13:09.270" style="s2">language and a complex sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.410" end="00:13:12.780" style="s2">how we communicate with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.270" end="00:13:17.970" style="s2">how the communicates with us and how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.780" end="00:13:21.630" style="s2">we create you know we have a poetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.970" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">manner or way or about a grace about us</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.630" end="00:13:27.210" style="s2">which isn&#39;t necessarily poetry but but</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:30.210" style="s2">poetry is is is a it&#39;s a primary form of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.210" end="00:13:32.300" style="s2">beauty and that reminds me I was going</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.210" end="00:13:35.100" style="s2">to read this at the beginning because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.300" end="00:13:37.460" style="s2">had a girlfriend when I was in college</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.100" end="00:13:41.700" style="s2">and and she had this written on her</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.460" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">mirror in in red ink and it&#39;s a quote by</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.700" end="00:13:48.840" style="s2">real Kay and it says Beauty is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:51.420" style="s2">but the beginning of terror for which we</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.840" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">are barely able to endure and it amazes</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.420" end="00:13:57.810" style="s2">us so because it serenely disdains to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:14:01.560" style="s2">destroy us every angel is terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.810" end="00:14:04.440" style="s2">maybe you know that quote I find the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.560" end="00:14:08.820" style="s2">word serenely disdains to destroy us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.440" end="00:14:11.640" style="s2">be very interesting again and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.820" end="00:14:16.080" style="s2">after after after you know reading this</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.640" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">on on my on this person&#39;s mirror and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.080" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been reflecting I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:22.770" style="s2">reflected I mean that why is beauty why</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:23.820" style="s2">is there a terror to beauty and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.770" end="00:14:25.410" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I&#39;ll be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.820" end="00:14:28.500" style="s2">about the rest of my life I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.410" end="00:14:29.850" style="s2">I could I could give you an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.500" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">any of the questions especially the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.850" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">question about what is beauty so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.790" end="00:14:39.870" style="s2">next thing I had written on my thing was</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2">elegance and I think this is related to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.870" end="00:14:47.010" style="s2">stoicism actually so one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">I think stoicism is very popular in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.010" end="00:14:52.440" style="s2">these days is because it&#39;s taking a step</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:54.330" style="s2">back right from this point if ocation</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.440" end="00:14:57.000" style="s2">from this instant gratification from</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.330" end="00:14:59.550" style="s2">this you know we&#39;ve all we&#39;ve all turned</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.000" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">into you know addicts of some kind and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.550" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">and stoic stoicism is is is is taking a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:08.250" style="s2">step back in and saying we should be</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:14.140" style="s2">elegant you know in our morality and an</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.250" end="00:15:17.110" style="s2">error in our disposition the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.140" end="00:15:18.610" style="s2">next the next part I had was wildness so</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.110" end="00:15:20.940" style="s2">if their elegance on one hand and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.610" end="00:15:24.670" style="s2">and Nietzsche calls out the Apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.940" end="00:15:27.070" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the Dionysian and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.670" end="00:15:31.480" style="s2">Dionysian is this dynamic wildness is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.070" end="00:15:33.970" style="s2">elemental wildness you know so if things</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.480" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">become too stoic become too contained</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.970" end="00:15:38.920" style="s2">become too elegant too contrived you</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:41.140" style="s2">know we have to in a Verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.920" end="00:15:42.520" style="s2">language you have to break the frame you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.140" end="00:15:44.200" style="s2">know and experience some wildness we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.520" end="00:15:46.990" style="s2">have to allow chaos into our lives we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.200" end="00:15:48.640" style="s2">have to you know have a have an orgy</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.990" end="00:15:50.320" style="s2">Earth&#39;s not not a real ergy but how</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.640" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">about you know well maybe how about</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:54.700" style="s2">having just some kind of a you know wild</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:56.110" style="s2">expression you know of the Dionysian you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.700" end="00:15:59.520" style="s2">know which we need to experience that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:16:02.530" style="s2">that&#39;s an important experience to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.520" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">whatever that means I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.530" end="00:16:06.130" style="s2">that means in this culture and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:09.490" style="s2">sure if we experienced that maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.130" end="00:16:13.320" style="s2">you know maybe in this kind of dance</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.490" end="00:16:18.370" style="s2">wild dance parties and and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.320" end="00:16:19.810" style="s2">okay so I also wrote down you know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.370" end="00:16:21.640" style="s2">know there&#39;s something vulnerable about</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.810" end="00:16:24.760" style="s2">beauty they&#39;re not fragile but</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.640" end="00:16:26.170" style="s2">vulnerable right that&#39;s a difference so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.760" end="00:16:29.290" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a vulnerability which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.170" end="00:16:32.260" style="s2">actually a form of strength there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.290" end="00:16:35.200" style="s2">complexity right there again i-it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.260" end="00:16:37.960" style="s2">there&#39;s not a simple it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.200" end="00:16:39.820" style="s2">simple it&#39;s it&#39;s not complicated right</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.960" end="00:16:42.700" style="s2">beauty is not complicated we know what</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.820" end="00:16:44.380" style="s2">it is we know everybody knows what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.700" end="00:16:46.300" style="s2">even though we can&#39;t define it because</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.380" end="00:16:49.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s complex it&#39;s it&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.300" end="00:16:54.580" style="s2">complex phenomenon beauty and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.630" end="00:16:57.070" style="s2">why again it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s the compass</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.580" end="00:16:59.890" style="s2">maybe in at the same time you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.070" end="00:17:01.510" style="s2">stormy sea and and and and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.890" end="00:17:03.550" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know which way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.510" end="00:17:05.949" style="s2">going so it is the core and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.550" end="00:17:09.699" style="s2">compass but but we have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.949" end="00:17:15.880" style="s2">sort of keep unveiling these veils that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.699" end="00:17:17.770" style="s2">are presented to us and I guess the last</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.880" end="00:17:20.230" style="s2">thing I think I wrote which was contrary</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.770" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">to the idea of noises is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.230" end="00:17:26.290" style="s2">beauty emerges from from from silence at</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:28.280" style="s2">least in my experience as being somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.290" end="00:17:30.010" style="s2">who&#39;s done a lot of Buddhist meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.280" end="00:17:34.100" style="s2">you know the most the moments where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.010" end="00:17:36.200" style="s2">felt the most beauty I have to have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.100" end="00:17:38.030" style="s2">in moments of intense presence and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.200" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">silence and that could that could be in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.030" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">meditation retreat it could be a you</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:46.100" style="s2">know it could be in a in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.100" end="00:17:47.210" style="s2">with with a person you know it&#39;s but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.100" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">but there&#39;s always there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.210" end="00:17:57.830" style="s2">ground of silence contained which</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">contains that expression so um hmm what</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.830" end="00:18:00.680" style="s2">else didn&#39;t want to say about that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:03.710" style="s2">think I think I&#39;ve gone through my list</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.680" end="00:18:08.030" style="s2">so what if and perhaps could do right</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.710" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">now is just just open you open the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.030" end="00:18:17.900" style="s2">conversation up you know to maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">know some you know you know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.900" end="00:18:23.750" style="s2">if what anything I&#39;ve said has sparked</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:25.400" style="s2">any have provoked you in any kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.750" end="00:18:29.660" style="s2">or or you think it&#39;s true or not true</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.400" end="00:18:31.670" style="s2">it&#39;s fine we I just want to I just want</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.660" end="00:18:32.870" style="s2">to I I love the the first two things</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.670" end="00:18:35.270" style="s2">that people said in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.870" end="00:18:37.400" style="s2">and I thought jeez you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.270" end="00:18:41.900" style="s2">there&#39;s so many ways to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.400" end="00:18:43.460" style="s2">it&#39;s almost infinite so beauty is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.900" end="00:18:47.150" style="s2">compass that&#39;s that&#39;s a good one the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.460" end="00:18:48.680" style="s2">core and and again the fact that as</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.150" end="00:18:50.990" style="s2">Timothy says with you know this this</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.680" end="00:18:53.420" style="s2">task that we have and the culture is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.990" end="00:18:57.950" style="s2">responding you know with any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.420" end="00:19:00.290" style="s2">elegance or any kind of beauty to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.950" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">going on it&#39;s just increased creasing ly</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.290" end="00:19:03.860" style="s2">noisy and that&#39;s oh that&#39;s the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">thing I want to say it&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.860" end="00:19:09.500" style="s2">doing here is a resistance to that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">so resistance is that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.500" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">revolutionary act of beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:20.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a resistance to that noise to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:23.030" style="s2">denial of beauty okay yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.660" end="00:19:25.550" style="s2">Andrew for these these questions these</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.030" end="00:19:26.860" style="s2">ideas provocations I want to remind</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.800" end="00:19:53.090" style="s2">as it comes up to share and I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.320" end="00:19:54.590" style="s2">inspired by this idea like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.090" end="00:19:57.320" style="s2">things I wrote down is I&#39;m rebelling</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.590" end="00:19:59.330" style="s2">against these parts of me that are have</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.320" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">been addicted to this immediate</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.330" end="00:20:05.720" style="s2">gratification and these facades of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">beauty and I appreciate that the way you</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.720" end="00:20:11.690" style="s2">ended that Andrew yeah addiction is is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:14.420" style="s2">perhaps another denial of beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.690" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">it&#39;s how we deny Beauty because Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.420" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">can be painful and put us in vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">situations yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:31.040" style="s2">Timothy would you like to ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:33.500" style="s2">question yeah I wondered if for me I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.040" end="00:20:38.390" style="s2">thinking about what what is beauty for</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.500" end="00:20:42.100" style="s2">me and it seems to somehow relate to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.390" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">authenticity like when either I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.100" end="00:20:50.330" style="s2">deeply authentic or I experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:54.200" style="s2">somebody something a situation that has</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.330" end="00:20:55.910" style="s2">that deep authenticity I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.200" end="00:20:57.500" style="s2">there&#39;s any difference between that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.910" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">what I perceive as beauty</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.500" end="00:21:04.120" style="s2">I wondered what people thought about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:09.920" style="s2">relationship maybe between authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.120" end="00:21:12.290" style="s2">and beauty yeah but an authenticity is</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.920" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">often this is an abused term in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.290" end="00:21:19.430" style="s2">sense at times because just being</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:22.070" style="s2">authentic right all the time you know is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.430" end="00:21:24.140" style="s2">what a child does right on some level so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.070" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the perversion of this idea I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.140" end="00:21:30.340" style="s2">agree with what you&#39;re saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:33.530" style="s2">what is truly authentic it is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.340" end="00:21:34.940" style="s2">so I think that that I think we grow</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.530" end="00:21:37.250" style="s2">into beauty like there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.940" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">stages of authenticity and I think there</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.250" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">will always have to be beyond ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:43.580" style="s2">we can&#39;t we can&#39;t just be there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:45.980" style="s2">something phony about authenticity if</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.580" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just remaining what it is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.980" end="00:21:50.500" style="s2">not transcending itself does that make</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:50.500" style="s2">any sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.430" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">makes sense to me it reminds me of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.100" end="00:22:04.020" style="s2">my youngest cousin why my little cousin</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:06.330" style="s2">why I&#39;m playing with her and she&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.020" end="00:22:08.310" style="s2">all of her authenticity she doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.330" end="00:22:12.090" style="s2">that she&#39;s being authentic she&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.310" end="00:22:13.350" style="s2">herself and often times I&#39;ve put on like</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.090" end="00:22:17.010" style="s2">sort of a performance of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.350" end="00:22:19.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed that in myself and I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.010" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">sort of learn from her that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.680" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">think she&#39;s learned how to do that yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.160" end="00:22:28.610" style="s2">Jacob would you share your inquiry here</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.050" end="00:22:46.620" style="s2">yeah how good is beauty not just in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.580" end="00:22:51.330" style="s2">dimension of good and if so talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.620" end="00:22:54.990" style="s2">beauties is to moralize and if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.330" end="00:22:56.130" style="s2">not case why not that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.990" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">question and that&#39;s what I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.130" end="00:23:00.120" style="s2">to John about that actually and he was</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:03.180" style="s2">he said wisdom is the virtue of PR</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.120" end="00:23:05.910" style="s2">beauty is a virtue of wisdom know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.180" end="00:23:08.130" style="s2">that what he said beauty is the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.910" end="00:23:11.430" style="s2">of wisdom yeah yeah I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.130" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">and I agree with that statement in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.430" end="00:23:16.050" style="s2">and another way I think beauty is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:18.060" style="s2">good and evil so I want to put into</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.050" end="00:23:19.980" style="s2">Nietzsche inside there because beauty</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.060" end="00:23:22.680" style="s2">drives you forward it&#39;s like the sirens</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.980" end="00:23:24.810" style="s2">in the audience right um it can destroy</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.680" end="00:23:28.140" style="s2">your or you know or make you make you I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.810" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">knew so so there&#39;s some there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.140" end="00:23:32.160" style="s2">there&#39;s some post morality Beauty I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.410" style="s2">would say that there&#39;s an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.160" end="00:23:36.570" style="s2">component always always to to what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.410" end="00:23:38.250" style="s2">what it&#39;s beautiful and I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.570" end="00:23:39.420" style="s2">say ethics in this you know Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.250" end="00:23:43.680" style="s2">would say ethics is a more dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.420" end="00:23:48.420" style="s2">process than good evil morality does</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.680" end="00:23:50.040" style="s2">that make sense we&#39;d have to go long</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.420" end="00:23:52.800" style="s2">form to make sense of it I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.040" end="00:23:56.340" style="s2">but for now sure thank you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.800" end="00:23:59.100" style="s2">welcome thank you it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.340" end="00:24:01.400" style="s2">to carry into the bonus round maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.100" end="00:24:01.400" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.900" end="00:24:10.590" style="s2">um I liked that the concept of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.470" end="00:24:13.170" style="s2">got brought up um I see that as one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.590" end="00:24:14.700" style="s2">the biggest denials of beauty that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.170" end="00:24:16.680" style="s2">see in our culture and I just wondered</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.700" end="00:24:20.490" style="s2">if you could riff a bit about how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.680" end="00:24:25.160" style="s2">could resist addiction and and get more</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.490" end="00:24:27.270" style="s2">beauty in that area of our lives well</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.160" end="00:24:29.070" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.270" end="00:24:31.530" style="s2">my experience during the Kovan you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.070" end="00:24:34.380" style="s2">crisis and the fact that I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.530" end="00:24:37.380" style="s2">to go to work and I managed to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.380" end="00:24:39.390" style="s2">managed to tone down my addiction to</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.380" end="00:24:43.590" style="s2">television I stopped watching so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.390" end="00:24:46.230" style="s2">television and and I think that helped</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.590" end="00:24:47.880" style="s2">me perceive the world better so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.230" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">I think I could I could see I could see</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.880" end="00:24:53.400" style="s2">things better so so I think that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:56.100" style="s2">of the you know because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.400" end="00:25:00.390" style="s2">entertainment we can entertain ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.100" end="00:25:01.980" style="s2">to death right so it&#39;s stepping up</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.390" end="00:25:03.030" style="s2">that&#39;s why stoicism probably is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.980" end="00:25:05.429" style="s2">important right now because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.030" end="00:25:09.480" style="s2">stepping stepping out of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.429" end="00:25:16.290" style="s2">constantly salient and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.480" end="00:25:17.910" style="s2">diversion and yeah well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.290" end="00:25:21.179" style="s2">addiction is a contraction it&#39;s a self</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.910" end="00:25:23.190" style="s2">contraction right you just you wallow in</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.179" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">your inwardness and you stop seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.190" end="00:25:29.309" style="s2">world or you get you get hooked on all</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:31.730" style="s2">these experiences and you stop seeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.309" end="00:25:34.450" style="s2">the small things</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.730" end="00:25:36.310" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.450" end="00:25:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s perhaps one way to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.310" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">this huge topic addiction I think again</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.280" end="00:25:42.850" style="s2">I&#39;m quoting John for Vicki because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:44.680" style="s2">spoken to him a lot recently and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.850" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">talks about reciprocal narrowing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.680" end="00:25:48.340" style="s2">world gets narrower and narrower and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:54.910" style="s2">narrower the more you know addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.340" end="00:25:56.500" style="s2">you are two things on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.910" end="00:25:59.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a dynamic between our addictions</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.500" end="00:26:02.230" style="s2">and and and then wanting to break the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.860" end="00:26:04.060" style="s2">frame right like in the evening I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.230" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">have a glass of wine because my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.060" end="00:26:08.650" style="s2">too contracted and I want to you know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:10.920" style="s2">want to break out of so so you can ride</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.650" end="00:26:13.750" style="s2">the edge of your addictions a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.920" end="00:26:16.270" style="s2">and that can be an interesting process</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.750" end="00:26:17.430" style="s2">because we all have addictions I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:19.180" style="s2">we&#39;re addicted to coffee</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.430" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;re addicted to everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.180" end="00:26:23.500" style="s2">that there&#39;s a hundred percent addiction</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:25.420" style="s2">in our culture basically nobody is I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.500" end="00:26:29.400" style="s2">haven&#39;t met a person that&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.420" end="00:26:29.400" style="s2">addicted to something</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.570" end="00:26:40.850" style="s2">thanks for your question yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:45.289" style="s2">what you asked you a question about</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.850" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">stoicism I probably got stoicism all all</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.289" end="00:26:52.609" style="s2">wrong because I&#39;m not an expert but join</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:54.440" style="s2">the club my friend so thank you paces so</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.609" end="00:26:57.529" style="s2">Andrew you previously wrote</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.440" end="00:27:00.169" style="s2">stoicism aru&#39;s what does it say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.529" end="00:27:03.019" style="s2">worship is stoicism the religion that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.169" end="00:27:04.909" style="s2">not a religion I love those juicy</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.019" end="00:27:06.619" style="s2">questions so I wonder if you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.909" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">elaborate and maybe how that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.619" end="00:27:14.389" style="s2">beauty yeah well perhaps I could speak</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:16.100" style="s2">from the perspective of you know my own</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.389" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">experience in tradition which is you</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.100" end="00:27:20.659" style="s2">know I&#39;m a practitioner of Tanjung</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">Buddhism and in touch and Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.659" end="00:27:24.200" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s you can divide you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.580" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">provide Buddhism into if you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.200" end="00:27:28.369" style="s2">divide it into all kinds of things but</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:30.379" style="s2">you could divide it into Sutra which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.369" end="00:27:32.509" style="s2">the path of renunciation which means</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.379" end="00:27:34.519" style="s2">giving up things and I kind of think of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.509" end="00:27:38.450" style="s2">that as being a stoic activity at giving</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.519" end="00:27:40.429" style="s2">up things like letting go of things and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.450" end="00:27:42.379" style="s2">letting go of all that and then Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.429" end="00:27:44.690" style="s2">means that you you you sorta move into</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.379" end="00:27:51.169" style="s2">the area where you you confront energies</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.690" end="00:27:54.489" style="s2">directly and and and you kind of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.169" end="00:27:54.489" style="s2">that&#39;s the place beyond good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.210" end="00:28:00.289" style="s2">beyond let&#39;s say a fixed kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.470" end="00:28:01.730" style="s2">morality and I don&#39;t mean a morality I</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.289" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">don&#39;t mean because you always have you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.730" end="00:28:08.299" style="s2">always have to have a good grounding in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:10.369" style="s2">discipline before you can become an</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.299" end="00:28:16.279" style="s2">experimental person an experimental</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.369" end="00:28:18.799" style="s2">artist and so I think for me the stores</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.279" end="00:28:21.619" style="s2">like a pop culture version of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:23.480" style="s2">in a way a very expensive version of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.619" end="00:28:26.389" style="s2">stoicism and a kind of sexy version of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.480" end="00:28:27.980" style="s2">stoicism which I like you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.389" end="00:28:30.259" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.980" end="00:28:33.889" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how it compares to how</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.259" end="00:28:41.090" style="s2">actual stoicism was practiced back in</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.889" end="00:28:43.539" style="s2">the day so a rue if it&#39;s a ruse it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.090" end="00:28:43.539" style="s2">good ruse</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.129" end="00:28:53.879" style="s2">does that is that satisfying your your</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.649" end="00:28:56.129" style="s2">question Peter or do you want to I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.879" end="00:28:58.649" style="s2">probably couldn&#39;t talk to you about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.129" end="00:29:07.979" style="s2">all day but I think that&#39;s good for now</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.649" end="00:29:13.379" style="s2">okay Gwen would you share what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.979" end="00:29:15.179" style="s2">shared in the chat where&#39;s Glenn shared</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.379" end="00:29:17.759" style="s2">C Segar me he&#39;s on the second page</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.179" end="00:29:21.080" style="s2">where&#39;s Glenn yeah we just got an image</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.759" end="00:29:26.639" style="s2">of him in outer space can you hear me</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.080" end="00:29:29.999" style="s2">yes perfect so yeah when you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.639" end="00:29:31.739" style="s2">talking about beauty it reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.999" end="00:29:35.159" style="s2">something that I heard Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.739" end="00:29:36.629" style="s2">talked about and he made the point that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.159" end="00:29:39.720" style="s2">you want to surround yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.629" end="00:29:42.929" style="s2">beauty because it is intimidating and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.720" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">basically holds up a mirror to all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.929" end="00:29:49.830" style="s2">things that are ugly right by having the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:52.499" style="s2">ultimate form of say beauty in front of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.830" end="00:29:55.019" style="s2">you it makes you self reflect and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.499" end="00:29:57.570" style="s2">realize where you&#39;re lacking in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.019" end="00:30:01.710" style="s2">standard that the artist is presenting</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.570" end="00:30:04.190" style="s2">in front of you and I find that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.710" end="00:30:07.889" style="s2">artists that live right on the edge are</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.190" end="00:30:10.379" style="s2">staring dead in the face of beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.889" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">ugliness and they&#39;re able to come back</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.379" end="00:30:17.580" style="s2">from that edge and present to the public</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:20.759" style="s2">at large what they saw and in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.580" end="00:30:23.099" style="s2">when the public interacts with it they</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.759" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">see their own flaws and they see their</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.099" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">own promise for potential and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the value of having art in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:33.720" style="s2">life and and I didn&#39;t realize the full</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:35.639" style="s2">potential of that until I just took that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.720" end="00:30:37.529" style="s2">wisdom and applied it to my life and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.639" end="00:30:42.029" style="s2">began putting a lot of art into my</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.529" end="00:30:44.909" style="s2">immediate space and it is it it makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.029" end="00:30:46.769" style="s2">you reassess everything that you do in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.909" end="00:30:47.399" style="s2">the presence of something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.769" end="00:30:49.739" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.399" end="00:30:51.869" style="s2">and then I happen to see in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.739" end="00:30:54.679" style="s2">documentary about Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.869" end="00:30:58.679" style="s2">how his house is decorated but by sheer</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.679" end="00:30:59.309" style="s2">massive pieces of artwork from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.679" end="00:31:01.830" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.309" end="00:31:04.409" style="s2">or to and and and communist Russia time</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.830" end="00:31:07.980" style="s2">period and he basically intimidates</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.409" end="00:31:11.070" style="s2">himself with beauty and the ugliness of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.980" end="00:31:13.350" style="s2">beauty at the same time and I just found</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.070" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">that very powerful so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.350" end="00:31:18.210" style="s2">bringing it up it was a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:20.220" style="s2">topic yeah I like that and and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.210" end="00:31:21.929" style="s2">comes to mind is the sublime when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.220" end="00:31:26.669" style="s2">say that and the sublime is always</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.929" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">something you know beyond you and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.669" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">it&#39;s good it&#39;s good it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.970" end="00:31:35.940" style="s2">good it&#39;s good to always be self trans</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:40.980" style="s2">transcending and if you if you surround</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.940" end="00:31:42.539" style="s2">yourself in beauty yeah yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.980" end="00:31:44.519" style="s2">there is a sense that the ugliness</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.539" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">because of the world becomes more stark</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.519" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">or evident I agree with that and so so</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">but so your life becomes you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.769" end="00:31:59.429" style="s2">more difficult actually Beauty presents</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.779" end="00:32:01.860" style="s2">a difficulty it&#39;s not again that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.429" end="00:32:04.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not a smoothness in the hands in</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.860" end="00:32:07.769" style="s2">the Han sense of it it predict it</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.230" end="00:32:10.649" style="s2">presents a challenge to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.769" end="00:32:14.700" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.649" end="00:32:16.710" style="s2">rejected in a relationship you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.700" end="00:32:19.340" style="s2">there&#39;s you fall in love with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.710" end="00:32:21.749" style="s2">and then you just crash because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.340" end="00:32:24.059" style="s2">something and then then you you start to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.749" end="00:32:27.809" style="s2">say okay I have to find out who I am and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.059" end="00:32:30.840" style="s2">I have to you know build myself up from</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.809" end="00:32:33.029" style="s2">scratch and and you know I have to meet</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.840" end="00:32:35.429" style="s2">that beauty somehow we have to meet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.029" end="00:32:37.649" style="s2">something we need to to meet on some</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.429" end="00:32:43.350" style="s2">level and and yeah that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.649" end="00:32:46.049" style="s2">serenely disdains to annihilate us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.350" end="00:32:49.019" style="s2">it seems to force you to take the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.049" end="00:32:53.309" style="s2">ultimate responsibility right and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.019" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">the more responsibility you take the yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.309" end="00:32:57.990" style="s2">the more difficult life can seem but</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:59.340" style="s2">then actually it you kind of transcend</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.990" end="00:33:01.799" style="s2">that difficulty through the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.340" end="00:33:04.259" style="s2">responsibility and on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.799" end="00:33:05.940" style="s2">seems to be this this freedom right this</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.259" end="00:33:09.059" style="s2">freedom yeah on the other side is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.940" end="00:33:10.860" style="s2">freedom of play right which is yes my</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.059" end="00:33:12.860" style="s2">boundless beauty which doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.860" end="00:33:15.330" style="s2">reference points</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.860" end="00:33:18.510" style="s2">you know there is there&#39;s a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.330" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">the kind of you know so I live in Paris</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.510" end="00:33:21.450" style="s2">and sometimes I walk around the louver</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:23.010" style="s2">and there&#39;s these grandiose paintings</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.450" end="00:33:24.870" style="s2">and you feel crushed by them because</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.010" end="00:33:27.210" style="s2">they&#39;re so and then you walk into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.870" end="00:33:29.610" style="s2">impressionist area and you see Cezanne</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.210" end="00:33:31.799" style="s2">and what stays and did is very</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.610" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">interesting you know the painter Paul</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.799" end="00:33:36.690" style="s2">Cezanne who invented Impressionism he</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.669" style="s2">was a classically trained painter and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.690" end="00:33:40.590" style="s2">was trying to do this imposing form of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.669" end="00:33:42.929" style="s2">beauty right he was trying to he</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.590" end="00:33:44.789" style="s2">mastered all the the the classical</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.929" end="00:33:46.110" style="s2">techniques and then he took all of his</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.789" end="00:33:48.510" style="s2">paintings and he put them in a bonfire</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.110" end="00:33:50.520" style="s2">and burnt them all cuz he was he knew</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.510" end="00:33:53.850" style="s2">that he wasn&#39;t really creating beauty he</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.520" end="00:33:56.820" style="s2">was creating an imitation right and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.850" end="00:33:58.710" style="s2">he came up with like you know this these</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.820" end="00:34:00.750" style="s2">mountains that have no perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.710" end="00:34:02.850" style="s2">you know and they&#39;re just color and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.750" end="00:34:04.650" style="s2">he started to paint an interior</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.850" end="00:34:08.129" style="s2">landscape he started to find his own</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.650" end="00:34:10.080" style="s2">sense of beauty which wasn&#39;t in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.129" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">hierarchical mode right it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.080" end="00:34:17.580" style="s2">beyond that somehow and that that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.030" end="00:34:19.050" style="s2">this creation of Impressionism and which</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.580" end="00:34:21.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that hierarchical sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.050" end="00:34:23.100" style="s2">it&#39;s you can look at the mountain of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.780" end="00:34:26.609" style="s2">Sant Victoire from all different angles</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.100" end="00:34:29.369" style="s2">and you know and see something it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.609" end="00:34:33.270" style="s2">a constricted landscape there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.369" end="00:34:35.639" style="s2">a freedom to it so I I agree with what</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.270" end="00:34:37.850" style="s2">Petersen says but that&#39;s the first step</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.639" end="00:34:41.129" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s the suit trionic step</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.850" end="00:34:46.500" style="s2">if I can use Buddhist terminology or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.129" end="00:34:49.169" style="s2">stoic stoic step yeah you remind me of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.500" end="00:34:51.540" style="s2">kind of like what Carl Jung or junior</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.169" end="00:34:54.810" style="s2">tolking did like talking said that he</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.540" end="00:34:57.330" style="s2">entered into the land of fairy and he he</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.810" end="00:34:59.640" style="s2">gave you the stories that he saw and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.330" end="00:35:02.100" style="s2">seems that Jung entered the land of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.640" end="00:35:05.580" style="s2">unconsciousness right and he he brought</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.100" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">back the stories so to your point yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.580" end="00:35:11.220" style="s2">there seems to be something beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">that hierarchy that people want to fight</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.220" end="00:35:14.850" style="s2">in right it seems to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:18.359" style="s2">dominant culture ideal that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.850" end="00:35:20.330" style="s2">fight to be on the top but it almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.359" end="00:35:23.369" style="s2">seems when you enter into this other</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.330" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">liminal space that there is no more</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.369" end="00:35:27.510" style="s2">competition it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:29.970" style="s2">Hey what are your what are you seeing</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.510" end="00:35:33.270" style="s2">from your perspective and let&#39;s share</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.970" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">stories and see if we witness the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.270" end="00:35:37.980" style="s2">thing or not for Vickie said that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">beauty is the sweet spot between</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.980" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">suchness and more nests and more nests</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:46.170" style="s2">is this expensive quality right you you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.849" style="s2">know you go beyond yourself you just you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.170" end="00:35:50.940" style="s2">know it&#39;s too much right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.849" end="00:35:52.950" style="s2">unbearable right in a sense and and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.940" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">it just keeps going and going and going</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.950" end="00:35:57.450" style="s2">and going right and then the suchness is</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:59.550" style="s2">the most intimate the most near the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.450" end="00:36:03.240" style="s2">domestic the most it&#39;s that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.550" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">earth it&#39;s grounded and and so so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.240" end="00:36:07.589" style="s2">always going you know we always have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">experiment with more earnest right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.589" end="00:36:21.480" style="s2">then and then come down to such nacelle</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:24.210" style="s2">ever dynamic process you know then we we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.480" end="00:36:25.829" style="s2">can we can become connected with</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.210" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">something that we might be able to call</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.829" end="00:36:35.099" style="s2">beauty you show you a question sorry</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:36.660" style="s2">Brendan sorry was you wanted to finish</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.099" end="00:36:39.059" style="s2">what he was saying so you want to just</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.660" end="00:36:41.490" style="s2">continue oh sure I was gonna say I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.059" end="00:36:44.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a very good point that you kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.490" end="00:36:48.140" style="s2">of have to reach out into chaos while</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.790" end="00:36:51.299" style="s2">you still keep one foot grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.140" end="00:36:54.839" style="s2">sometimes you can fall 100% in the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.299" end="00:36:56.819" style="s2">and the ones that seem to come back seem</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.839" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">to be the the wounded people that heal</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.819" end="00:37:02.460" style="s2">themselves and they throw out times have</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:04.349" style="s2">been called shamans and I think we need</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.460" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">to see more and more of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.349" end="00:37:09.960" style="s2">archaic revival to take terence</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:12.089" style="s2">mckenna&#39;s idea and and respect the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.960" end="00:37:14.040" style="s2">archaic traditions that allowed human</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.089" end="00:37:16.559" style="s2">beings to reach the point where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.040" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">right now I mean I think diving into</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.559" end="00:37:21.510" style="s2">that that space that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:23.700" style="s2">about introduces a lot of people to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.510" end="00:37:27.900" style="s2">the ancients saw and that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.700" end="00:37:30.530" style="s2">trying to rediscover and recreate thank</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.900" end="00:37:30.530" style="s2">you for letting me finish</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.140" end="00:37:41.369" style="s2">Thank You Glenn David I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.549" end="00:37:46.859" style="s2">good time for your question and thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.369" end="00:37:48.269" style="s2">on transcendence yeah you said notice</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.859" end="00:37:52.440" style="s2">like my heart&#39;s pounding and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.269" end="00:37:55.079" style="s2">like all this aliveness in me and like</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.440" end="00:37:58.170" style="s2">all my nervous how am I excited like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.079" end="00:38:00.599" style="s2">really care about this and listening to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.170" end="00:38:02.759" style="s2">you Andrew when you&#39;re like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.599" end="00:38:04.349" style="s2">gesturing towards beauty like we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.759" end="00:38:06.390" style="s2">really define it you can kind of point</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.349" end="00:38:09.480" style="s2">towards it I kept thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.390" end="00:38:11.609" style="s2">transcendence or like the sacred like</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.480" end="00:38:14.700" style="s2">beauty maybe is like getting a glimpse</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.609" end="00:38:17.910" style="s2">of the transcendence and then definitely</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.700" end="00:38:21.569" style="s2">our culture seems to kind of obliterate</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.910" end="00:38:23.099" style="s2">the sacred through abstraction and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.569" end="00:38:25.650" style="s2">know commodification and all these</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.099" end="00:38:27.329" style="s2">things and and so I&#39;m curious in your</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.650" end="00:38:29.819" style="s2">world what is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.329" end="00:38:34.829" style="s2">beauty and transcendence or the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.819" end="00:38:36.630" style="s2">like what&#39;s the difference yeah that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.829" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">had an interesting again I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.630" end="00:38:40.829" style="s2">my conversation with for Vicki about</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:43.289" style="s2">this and he said the sacred and I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.829" end="00:38:47.339" style="s2">thinking of Renny Gerard you know who is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.289" end="00:38:49.739" style="s2">he had this theory about the sacred the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.339" end="00:38:53.279" style="s2">sacred is is is is often related to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.739" end="00:38:54.749" style="s2">violence in some kind of a way so</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.279" end="00:38:58.349" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two kinds of sacred</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.749" end="00:39:00.569" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.349" end="00:39:04.529" style="s2">what is what is hidden there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.569" end="00:39:06.539" style="s2">hidden hidden aspect of the sacred and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.529" end="00:39:08.190" style="s2">and then I I said John what I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.539" end="00:39:12.059" style="s2">it&#39;s not the sacred I think it&#39;s way you</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.190" end="00:39:14.279" style="s2">have to worship right that that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.059" end="00:39:16.349" style="s2">more direct relationship to what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.279" end="00:39:18.359" style="s2">divine is is to worship because if</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.349" end="00:39:20.069" style="s2">there&#39;s something sacred then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.359" end="00:39:21.420" style="s2">distance from it a little bit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.069" end="00:39:24.239" style="s2">making its sacred you&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.420" end="00:39:27.150" style="s2">precious you&#39;re you&#39;re not really very</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.239" end="00:39:28.859" style="s2">yet on the other hand he&#39;s and then he</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.150" end="00:39:30.119" style="s2">said we a but it&#39;s like a fire you need</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.859" end="00:39:33.329" style="s2">to be sort of you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.119" end="00:39:35.849" style="s2">distance from the fire so so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.329" end="00:39:37.319" style="s2">interesting discussion in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.849" end="00:39:39.150" style="s2">transcendence there&#39;s these two</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.319" end="00:39:40.380" style="s2">movements there&#39;s transcendence and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.150" end="00:39:42.089" style="s2">there&#39;s the imminence so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.380" end="00:39:43.210" style="s2">breathing breathing in and breathing out</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.089" end="00:39:47.260" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.210" end="00:39:49.780" style="s2">you know Trent you&#39;re always you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.260" end="00:39:53.109" style="s2">always need should be on the edge right</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.780" end="00:39:54.849" style="s2">so there&#39;s an edge to beauty right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.109" end="00:39:56.619" style="s2">that you&#39;re transcending yourself all</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.849" end="00:39:58.810" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.619" end="00:40:00.940" style="s2">yeah but but but but you should you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.810" end="00:40:02.950" style="s2">should also be bringing that down to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.940" end="00:40:07.150" style="s2">most domestic the most ordinary the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.950" end="00:40:08.680" style="s2">real you know making it real so so</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.150" end="00:40:11.099" style="s2">beauty has to be grounded in the real</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.680" end="00:40:13.180" style="s2">that&#39;s why all this phantasmagorical</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.099" end="00:40:14.980" style="s2">images of beauty aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.180" end="00:40:16.930" style="s2">butyl beauty &#39;fl that&#39;s why the smooth</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.980" end="00:40:21.250" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily beautiful or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.930" end="00:40:24.010" style="s2">pornographic because it hasn&#39;t been it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.250" end="00:40:26.310" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been brought into I could say the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.010" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">heart and on some level if I can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.310" end="00:40:38.020" style="s2">prosaic about it and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.849" style="s2">there&#39;s this movie I don&#39;t know you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.020" end="00:40:43.030" style="s2">the movie metropolis and they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.849" end="00:40:44.380" style="s2">like the head and the hands need to join</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.030" end="00:40:46.839" style="s2">in the heart</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.380" end="00:40:50.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s beauty is a meeting place</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.839" end="00:40:52.510" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s funny how this this subject</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.920" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">is so vast and infinite you could just</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.510" end="00:41:01.570" style="s2">find different angles of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:41:05.770" style="s2">there&#39;s no end to it to to the important</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.570" end="00:41:12.190" style="s2">you know to the importance of meditating</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.770" end="00:41:14.890" style="s2">on on the beautiful I think and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.190" end="00:41:17.650" style="s2">don&#39;t come up with platonic ideals this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.890" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">is of let&#39;s say symmetry or something is</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.650" end="00:41:22.770" style="s2">beautiful or asymmetry is beautiful or</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:25.089" style="s2">you know whatever theory you have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.770" end="00:41:27.550" style="s2">beauty is this kind of ends up to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.089" end="00:41:30.869" style="s2">bullshit no because it&#39;s it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.550" end="00:41:30.869" style="s2">propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.610" end="00:41:43.980" style="s2">Lisa if you&#39;d like maybe expand on your</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:48.450" style="s2">question about relationships yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.980" end="00:41:51.150" style="s2">you you Tyson I think what Andrew just</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.450" end="00:41:59.840" style="s2">said about the meeting place that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.150" end="00:42:09.840" style="s2">God I got wondering about the if is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.840" end="00:42:12.060" style="s2">Beauty to goodness analogous to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.840" end="00:42:18.710" style="s2">moment of that meeting place the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.060" end="00:42:23.960" style="s2">encounter in that meeting place versus</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.710" end="00:42:28.200" style="s2">any kind of critique of judgment or</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.960" end="00:42:31.230" style="s2">agency I&#39;m fascinated by this question</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.200" end="00:42:33.750" style="s2">about the distinction between truth and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.230" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">beauty and I&#39;m thinking about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.750" end="00:42:38.790" style="s2">about time in this conversation so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:45.720" style="s2">relationship to the relationship that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.790" end="00:42:48.570" style="s2">can only encounter in the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.720" end="00:42:51.960" style="s2">know well a few thoughts when you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.570" end="00:42:54.690" style="s2">speaking the truth and beauty are not</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.960" end="00:42:57.810" style="s2">separate things right yeah you know you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.690" end="00:43:00.210" style="s2">know and often we associate truth with</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.810" end="00:43:02.520" style="s2">with the masculine and beauty with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.210" end="00:43:06.210" style="s2">feminine but and we have both those</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.520" end="00:43:09.180" style="s2">things inside of us right and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.210" end="00:43:11.250" style="s2">not separate that&#39;s one thought thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.180" end="00:43:14.850" style="s2">I had when you&#39;re speaking and in terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.250" end="00:43:17.250" style="s2">of time I say that beauty is oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.850" end="00:43:18.810" style="s2">it&#39;s completely unseats</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.250" end="00:43:21.450" style="s2">I think I have a French word on my head</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.810" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">on say said it can&#39;t be seized it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:27.780" style="s2">be captured it can&#39;t be it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:30.360" style="s2">reduced to anything it&#39;s always related</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.780" end="00:43:33.180" style="s2">to the relationship and in the moment in</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.360" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">time as you say I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.180" end="00:43:39.950" style="s2">it&#39;s very much related to context and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:42.210" style="s2">and this living moment in time and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.950" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">Heidegger talked about dies n being</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.210" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">being in time the beingness quality of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:48.600" style="s2">time and it&#39;s it&#39;s only alive and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:51.900" style="s2">only lives because</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.600" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">it&#39;s going to reach its end so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.900" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">poignant quality to that right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.160" end="00:44:05.370" style="s2">maybe Gray&#39;s comment reminds me of one</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.140" end="00:44:06.930" style="s2">of the questions that I woke up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.370" end="00:44:10.470" style="s2">this morning which was something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.930" end="00:44:13.830" style="s2">why beauty and why this conversation now</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.470" end="00:44:16.350" style="s2">as I&#39;ve been sort of I feel like forced</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.830" end="00:44:17.940" style="s2">to look at in in a good way but forced</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.350" end="00:44:20.670" style="s2">to look at a lot of the suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.940" end="00:44:23.660" style="s2">the pain in the world that maybe before</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.670" end="00:44:26.310" style="s2">I was maybe a little naive too or</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.660" end="00:44:29.880" style="s2">ignoring or distracted from it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.310" end="00:44:32.610" style="s2">more in my face and so I was questioning</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.880" end="00:44:34.080" style="s2">myself and like is this a sign of my</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.610" end="00:44:35.790" style="s2">privilege if I get to have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.080" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">conversation about beauty and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.790" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">going down these these thoughts but then</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:42.060" style="s2">having these reminders come in about why</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:43.260" style="s2">this conversation and deepening this</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.060" end="00:44:45.600" style="s2">relationship is important to me right</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.260" end="00:44:47.100" style="s2">now and so maybe I appreciate you asking</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.600" end="00:44:50.280" style="s2">this question I&#39;d love for you to share</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.100" end="00:44:54.420" style="s2">it so so basically why is Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.280" end="00:44:58.830" style="s2">important right now like as as we&#39;re as</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.420" end="00:45:06.650" style="s2">we have a sense that the world is sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:10.770" style="s2">of falling apart and I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.650" end="00:45:13.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a temptation to live in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.770" end="00:45:19.320" style="s2">kind of space of propositional you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.790" end="00:45:20.940" style="s2">idea law ideological thinking but it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.320" end="00:45:25.140" style="s2">it ends up being very counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.940" end="00:45:28.140" style="s2">often you know you just waste a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.140" end="00:45:33.000" style="s2">time thinking about you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.140" end="00:45:35.370" style="s2">watching the news and and and so so I I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.000" end="00:45:37.110" style="s2">do think that beauty has a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.370" end="00:45:40.620" style="s2">aspect but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.110" end="00:45:45.180" style="s2">propositional and and I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.620" end="00:45:49.580" style="s2">should deny it for any kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.180" end="00:45:52.410" style="s2">program any kind of movement any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.580" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">ideology I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think we should</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.410" end="00:45:59.160" style="s2">deny it because it is a compass eye that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:46:00.780" style="s2">was I think that was those Timothy who</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.160" end="00:46:02.440" style="s2">said that at the beginning it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.780" end="00:46:07.930" style="s2">compass and if we don&#39;t have that come</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.440" end="00:46:12.930" style="s2">we&#39;re lost you know maybe would you like</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.930" end="00:46:12.930" style="s2">to expand on that at all I respond I</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.700" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">like your name maybe I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.319" end="00:46:24.940" style="s2">maybe is a good name because cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:27.990" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s this we don&#39;t know right we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.940" end="00:46:32.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is that&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.990" end="00:46:34.030" style="s2">yeah anytime anybody qualifies their</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.140" end="00:46:38.859" style="s2">certainty I&#39;m like what is that does</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.030" end="00:46:43.690" style="s2">that mean I think the only thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.859" end="00:46:46.690" style="s2">ask as like a follow-up is um how does</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.690" end="00:46:50.290" style="s2">it feel brave to you to prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.690" end="00:46:51.819" style="s2">beauty does it ever feel hard is there</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.290" end="00:46:53.800" style="s2">anything you ever have to do to like</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.819" end="00:46:54.490" style="s2">psych yourself up to be like no Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.800" end="00:47:02.920" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.490" end="00:47:04.660" style="s2">I don&#39;t throw what the haters well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.920" end="00:47:06.490" style="s2">because we have in our minds you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.660" end="00:47:09.400" style="s2">weird ideas of beauty it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.490" end="00:47:13.869" style="s2">related to the cosmetic or the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.400" end="00:47:17.260" style="s2">or the cultural but I think I think I</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.869" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">think courage is inherited in beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.260" end="00:47:21.339" style="s2">all these perennial notions like</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:23.349" style="s2">theythey we were talking about indras</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.339" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">net right Enders net is like everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.349" end="00:47:26.890" style="s2">is reflected in everything else so</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:29.260" style="s2">virtue is reflected in beauty which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.890" end="00:47:32.109" style="s2">reflected in courage which is reflected</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.260" end="00:47:33.310" style="s2">in wisdom which is reflected in you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.109" end="00:47:35.319" style="s2">they&#39;re all reef they&#39;re all they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.310" end="00:47:41.349" style="s2">part of the you know they&#39;re all part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.319" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">this dynamic process and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.349" end="00:47:51.369" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a living textured experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:53.980" style="s2">and well I think maybe even politics</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.369" end="00:47:56.770" style="s2">could have an aspect of beautiful the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.980" end="00:48:00.040" style="s2">beauty if it was done right it almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.770" end="00:48:01.930" style="s2">never is alright and we can see that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.040" end="00:48:05.260" style="s2">well you know what they call game a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.930" end="00:48:07.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s it when it when when</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.260" end="00:48:10.390" style="s2">something becomes reified and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.480" end="00:48:11.320" style="s2">just it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a dead land it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.390" end="00:48:17.290" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.320" end="00:48:19.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a land of the dead right so so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.290" end="00:48:23.470" style="s2">I think any you wouldn&#39;t want I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.930" end="00:48:26.790" style="s2">want to limit beauty or poetry it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.470" end="00:48:29.950" style="s2">any particular domain I think it</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.790" end="00:48:32.530" style="s2">politics okay you know it&#39;s not my thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.950" end="00:48:34.540" style="s2">so much but other people I know are more</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.530" end="00:48:38.050" style="s2">involved in politics and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.540" end="00:48:40.450" style="s2">philosophy you know whatever you do if</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.050" end="00:48:42.190" style="s2">you&#39;re a waitress you know now you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.450" end="00:48:46.090" style="s2">do that with with a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.190" end="00:48:50.200" style="s2">beauty you know if you if you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.090" end="00:48:54.340" style="s2">know it&#39;s also related to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.200" end="00:48:56.200" style="s2">style as well you know somehow and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.340" end="00:49:00.550" style="s2">can feel it when you&#39;re in the presence</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.200" end="00:49:03.160" style="s2">of that somehow there&#39;s a coherence to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.550" end="00:49:07.810" style="s2">it that&#39;s Jordan halls term but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.160" end="00:49:09.460" style="s2">also a mystery so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.810" end="00:49:12.850" style="s2">coherence it&#39;s not just oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.460" end="00:49:19.350" style="s2">clarity right it&#39;s also mystery and</p>
