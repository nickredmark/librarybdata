<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.100" style="s2">I think it is more obvious than it has</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.129" end="00:00:08.610" style="s2">ever been that we live in subjective</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.100" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">realities and Trump you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.610" end="00:00:12.780" style="s2">want to talk a lot about Trump but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">he&#39;s clearly the person who most</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.780" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">exemplifies that the you could see what</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:20.699" style="s2">I call the two movies playing on one</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:22.980" style="s2">screen yeah that people are living in</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.699" end="00:00:25.380" style="s2">completely different realities some</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.980" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">people are living in a some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">horror movie in which everything&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">blow up any minute and others of us are</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:34.170" style="s2">living in the Golden Age it&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">better and it&#39;s not just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">better for some people it&#39;s worse for</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">others it&#39;s really the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">people they just happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">different political views some see it as</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:46.890" style="s2">a tragedy and some see it as a comedy</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">but they can both survive and reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.890" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">and work so one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">we&#39;re all learning at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what I write about is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">not seeing the world the way other</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">people are you&#39;re just not experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">the same thing they are and for all</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">practical purposes you live in your own</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">subjective world now that&#39;s independent</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">of whether there is a is a truth below</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even we don&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">get to that the only thing we we know</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">for sure is that we don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">it as humans so that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">interesting point it&#39;s sort of headed</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">off my next question at the pass a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">little bit my last recording I did was</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">with an artificial intelligence expert a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">PhD from MIT who&#39;s worked in the field</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">for a number of years his name is Nick</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">cos mattis and he&#39;s gonna be I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">probably release his a little bit before</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">this one and I asked him a question</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">about you know computers and their</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">ability to you know perceived the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">visually and whether or not that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:49.970" style="s2">going to lead us to conclude that there</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">was an actual concrete objective reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.970" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">that you know we can point to and say</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">yeah that rock is the rock and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">all the things to it and look these</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">computers from my very different angle</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">are seeing it the same way to would that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">at the end of the day to you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">of definitively show us that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">objective reality so that&#39;s my question</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">to you on that subject and then I guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve already told me that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">matter but well it might be true that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">all robot</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:17.879" style="s2">have the same subjective reality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:19.379" style="s2">I can see that because you&#39;d program</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.879" end="00:02:22.110" style="s2">them they&#39;d act they&#39;d act in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.379" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">predictable way but if you said okay now</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.110" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">let&#39;s take my robot my artificial</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:28.769" style="s2">intelligence and have it talked to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:29.489" style="s2">two of us who disagree on the reality it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.769" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.489" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">you know even if you totally trusted</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">that the robot was seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:38.610" style="s2">realistically you&#39;d still think this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:41.010" style="s2">robot was broken if it disagreed with</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.610" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">you it&#39;s like well I see what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.010" end="00:02:45.060" style="s2">saying but I&#39;m pretty sure this robots</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:47.849" style="s2">defective because that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:49.799" style="s2">seeing so people don&#39;t really easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.849" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">change their minds about reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.799" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">but but really I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.880" style="s2">interpretations of reality not not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">question of whether a rock is there or</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.880" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">not there we we generally agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">the rock is there or not there right do</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">you how much do you think our</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">perceptions of an objective reality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:12.410" style="s2">our own subjective reality then is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">influenced by our sort of our DNA and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.410" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">sort of a biological determinism because</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:20.280" style="s2">in your writing I definitely get the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:22.230" style="s2">sense that you mean very explicitly say</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.280" end="00:03:23.819" style="s2">that the information that we absorb in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.230" end="00:03:26.549" style="s2">the language that we use the language</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.819" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">that we&#39;re given help shape our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.549" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">reality but at the same time I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">struggle with the notion that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">for example you know can men and women</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">just switch their genders and their</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:38.700" style="s2">sexuality is on a whim I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.500" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">know that that&#39;s true because I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.700" end="00:03:42.540" style="s2">believe that there&#39;s an element of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">gender expression masculinity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.540" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">tied to our biology and to who we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:50.849" style="s2">chemically you know etc and so to what</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:54.810" style="s2">extent are those forces working together</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.849" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">in opposition which one is stronger what</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.810" end="00:03:59.849" style="s2">do I need to rely on more do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">rely on I&#39;m changing the inputs that go</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.849" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">into my head or maximizing the outputs</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.660" style="s2">that come out of my DNA what do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">think about that well in my how to fail</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.660" end="00:04:14.099" style="s2">book I talk about humans as being voiced</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:16.260" style="s2">robots in other words the the common way</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.099" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">that people imagine themselves and other</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.260" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">people is that you have thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">then those thoughts translate into your</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">actions and and certainly that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:27.480" style="s2">know true ish that that does happen but</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:29.760" style="s2">the hypnotist</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.480" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">you know and I&#39;m a trained hypnotist and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.760" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">when you learn the hypnosis you you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">learn that the world is backwards or</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:39.390" style="s2">upside down if you prefer and that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:41.910" style="s2">really happens is that our body is</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.390" end="00:04:44.340" style="s2">informing our brain what to think so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.910" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">can see that easily if you&#39;re let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.340" end="00:04:49.830" style="s2">you have kids and your kids are tired or</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.160" end="00:04:51.930" style="s2">hungry you know they start fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.830" end="00:04:53.670" style="s2">complaining and yelling and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.930" end="00:04:56.490" style="s2">get them to do anything and then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.670" end="00:04:58.410" style="s2">feed him a hot dog and then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.490" end="00:05:00.600" style="s2">they stop complaining they clean up</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.410" end="00:05:01.920" style="s2">their room and the first time somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.600" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">explained that to it was it was my</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.920" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">ex-wife she said no they&#39;re just hungry</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">and I would look at them and say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">not just hungry there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">deeply disturbing with these children</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:15.960" style="s2">and then you feed them and then they</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:17.730" style="s2">become normal immediately now of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.960" end="00:05:20.790" style="s2">as an adult you&#39;ve had that experience a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.730" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">million times you know that if depending</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.790" end="00:05:26.820" style="s2">on your state of mind the world can look</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">like a horror or a delight and and once</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.820" end="00:05:30.600" style="s2">you learn that if you get your body</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:34.200" style="s2">right if you take care of your health</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.600" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">your your stress especially you know get</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.200" end="00:05:38.070" style="s2">to sleep diet exercise if you get that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.450" style="s2">stuff right then your brain starts</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.070" end="00:05:42.030" style="s2">working the way you think you should</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.450" end="00:05:43.830" style="s2">have before but if but if you just start</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.030" end="00:05:45.830" style="s2">with the brain and said let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.830" end="00:05:48.450" style="s2">think my way out of these bad thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.830" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a tough one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.450" end="00:05:53.130" style="s2">interesting so if you took two people</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">who are watching them the screen and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.130" end="00:05:56.360" style="s2">seeing two different movies and you feed</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">them properly train them properly</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.360" end="00:06:01.320" style="s2">exercise them give them enough sleep</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.790" style="s2">make them as comfortable as possible is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.320" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">that gonna get them closer to the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.790" end="00:06:06.180" style="s2">movie or are they still gonna be seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:08.040" style="s2">two different movies if you can optimize</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.180" end="00:06:09.540" style="s2">yourself you&#39;re still going to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.040" end="00:06:11.070" style="s2">those differences yeah you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.540" end="00:06:12.900" style="s2">gonna have those differences the only</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.070" end="00:06:15.060" style="s2">difference in that example you gave me</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.900" end="00:06:17.730" style="s2">is that&#39;s people watching the scary</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.060" end="00:06:21.210" style="s2">movie it might be less scared yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.730" end="00:06:22.230" style="s2">because if your body is physically in</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.210" end="00:06:24.630" style="s2">good shape</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.230" end="00:06:27.810" style="s2">you can handle stress better so so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.630" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">would only be a minor correlation there</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.810" end="00:06:32.850" style="s2">is it possible to get people just to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">watch a different movie</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.850" end="00:06:41.130" style="s2">I hear people who say that I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">changed them so I asked after the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.130" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">election I did a tweet in which I asked</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:49.110" style="s2">people if anything I had done had</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:51.930" style="s2">changed their vote or their opinion</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.110" end="00:06:54.360" style="s2">about Trump as a candidate and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.930" end="00:06:56.700" style="s2">something like if I recall fifty and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.360" end="00:06:58.890" style="s2">hundred people told me that they changed</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.700" end="00:07:01.080" style="s2">their entire political view because of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.890" end="00:07:03.720" style="s2">watching me now that&#39;s just how many</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.080" end="00:07:05.940" style="s2">people responded Brian so you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.720" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">usually you know ten times that at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.940" end="00:07:11.010" style="s2">minimum okay so I don&#39;t know maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.000" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">fifty hundred thousand people changed</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.010" end="00:07:15.320" style="s2">their views after watching me but there</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:18.420" style="s2">were probably people who did not have</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.320" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">super-hardened views so the people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.420" end="00:07:22.740" style="s2">said you know let&#39;s say they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:24.660" style="s2">conservative to begin with and their</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.740" end="00:07:27.480" style="s2">first impression of Trump was negative</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.660" end="00:07:29.460" style="s2">well they were still conservatives and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.480" end="00:07:33.030" style="s2">he was still promoting conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.460" end="00:07:35.670" style="s2">views so it wasn&#39;t that big of a leap to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.030" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">go from you know being conservative to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.670" end="00:07:39.660" style="s2">embracing Trump it would be really hard</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">to change somebody from Democrat to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.660" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">Republican or vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:49.230" style="s2">changing demo hey everybody that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:52.230" style="s2">dog Rosie hey Rosie my podcast listeners</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.230" end="00:07:53.610" style="s2">an audience deaf whoa Rosie and just so</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.230" end="00:07:55.880" style="s2">happens the mailman decided to come</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.610" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">right that&#39;s we&#39;re recording so Rosie</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.880" end="00:07:59.550" style="s2">thank you honey I&#39;ll probably edit this</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:03.030" style="s2">part out I don&#39;t usually I did anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.550" end="00:08:05.070" style="s2">but maybe this part so that brings me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.030" end="00:08:07.350" style="s2">another question is so if people well</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.070" end="00:08:09.270" style="s2">first of all Democrats are deplorable is</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.350" end="00:08:11.180" style="s2">kind of my whole shtick so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.270" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">where my main focus has been on on</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.180" end="00:08:16.380" style="s2">myself I went through a process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">abandoning the Democratic Party I voted</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.380" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">for Obama two times I probably voted for</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:22.950" style="s2">Clinton if I can remember I never ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:25.920" style="s2">voted Republican no one in my family</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.950" end="00:08:27.300" style="s2">ever voted Republican but 2016 was was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.920" end="00:08:28.710" style="s2">time in which I realized that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.300" end="00:08:31.410" style="s2">Democratic Party had definitely moved</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.710" end="00:08:34.140" style="s2">away from me and that the the the new</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.410" end="00:08:35.640" style="s2">Republican Party as embodied by Trump</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.140" end="00:08:38.010" style="s2">and some of other elements to it were</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.640" end="00:08:39.930" style="s2">appealing to me and so maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.010" end="00:08:41.700" style="s2">maybe I didn&#39;t really change the party&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.930" end="00:08:45.410" style="s2">changed I think that that&#39;s one one</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.700" end="00:08:48.200" style="s2">reasonable example but if we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.410" end="00:08:50.750" style="s2">to watch two different movies and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.200" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">doing so watching those two different</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.750" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">movies leads us to conflict or when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">ask you what what are the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:01.790" style="s2">of having a nation that can observe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:04.700" style="s2">same thing and come away with to almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.790" end="00:09:07.610" style="s2">terrifyingly different conclusions well</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.700" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s not new so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.610" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">if you if you look at the super big</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:14.930" style="s2">picture or the course of evolution over</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:16.610" style="s2">the life of the earth look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.930" end="00:09:19.340" style="s2">animals who don&#39;t understand their</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.610" end="00:09:21.290" style="s2">reality you know does a clam understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.340" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">this reality does your dog understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.290" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">its reality really I mean it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.750" style="s2">know that the mailman is delivering mail</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:30.530" style="s2">it just just thinks it&#39;s an intruder or</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:32.150" style="s2">something right so apparently and and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.530" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">think we can say this safely because</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.150" end="00:09:37.070" style="s2">they&#39;re just literally what tens of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.790" end="00:09:38.990" style="s2">thousands of examples and no counter</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.070" end="00:09:40.790" style="s2">examples we can see all these creatures</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.990" end="00:09:42.230" style="s2">who don&#39;t understand their reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.790" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not humans but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.230" end="00:09:46.490" style="s2">understand that and yet they could</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:48.050" style="s2">reproduce they have they have everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.490" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">they need there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.050" end="00:09:52.130" style="s2">lacking if they can reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">that&#39;s all evolution demands of you so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.130" end="00:09:57.290" style="s2">what are the odds that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:09:59.450" style="s2">evolved to finally get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.290" end="00:10:01.490" style="s2">where they understand their reality and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.450" end="00:10:06.650" style="s2">you were lucky enough to be here for it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.490" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">I mean 15 billion years of since the Big</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.650" end="00:10:12.110" style="s2">Bang and how lucky that this little you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:14.600" style="s2">know hundred year period you just happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.110" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">to be born when we figured it all out so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:20.390" style="s2">I take it as given that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:23.480" style="s2">understand a reality but the the the two</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.390" end="00:10:25.640" style="s2">moviepro thing is not that different</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:29.270" style="s2">from a lot of things we see that work</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.640" end="00:10:30.950" style="s2">for example capitalism is you know buyer</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.270" end="00:10:33.650" style="s2">and a seller each you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.950" end="00:10:35.390" style="s2">it over on the other one it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.650" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">they&#39;re probably nine entertain ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.390" end="00:10:40.310" style="s2">things fail in capitalism and yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:44.120" style="s2">capitalism works even though it&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.310" end="00:10:45.410" style="s2">built around primarily failing nine and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.120" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">ten businesses that&#39;s a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.410" end="00:10:51.080" style="s2">failure rate and if you look at voting</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:55.220" style="s2">and cap and democracy you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.080" end="00:10:58.050" style="s2">democratic systems republic etc it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.220" end="00:11:02.130" style="s2">full of conflict and lying</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.050" end="00:11:05.130" style="s2">and and and fake news and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.130" end="00:11:07.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just this big cauldron of bile and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.130" end="00:11:09.330" style="s2">and evil and then we wake up in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.860" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">morning and we have the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.330" end="00:11:14.130" style="s2">economy you know a super capable</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:19.829" style="s2">military we&#39;re safer than we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.130" end="00:11:22.110" style="s2">been and I&#39;d have to say that the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.829" end="00:11:25.100" style="s2">conflict that we see is largely a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.110" end="00:11:28.440" style="s2">theatrical construct meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.100" end="00:11:30.630" style="s2">because politics is now our new form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.440" end="00:11:33.149" style="s2">entertainment and the whole world is</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.630" end="00:11:36.420" style="s2">watching you see essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.149" end="00:11:39.180" style="s2">exaggerated a hyperbolic theatrical</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.420" end="00:11:41.399" style="s2">version of reality and people you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.180" end="00:11:43.260" style="s2">as a lifestyle they buy into one version</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.399" end="00:11:45.540" style="s2">or another but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">the way the system is designed let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.540" end="00:11:50.190" style="s2">give all credit to the founders who came</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">up with the Constitution and yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.190" end="00:11:54.870" style="s2">tweaked it over time but if somehow</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:57.660" style="s2">handles all of that conflict all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.870" end="00:12:00.170" style="s2">stupidity all of that selfishness all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.660" end="00:12:04.110" style="s2">that fake news all that lying and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.170" end="00:12:06.660" style="s2">produces the Golden Age and we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.110" end="00:12:08.339" style="s2">point where humans have never looked at</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.660" end="00:12:12.180" style="s2">a better situation than we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.339" end="00:12:13.980" style="s2">right now absolutely so apparently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.180" end="00:12:16.589" style="s2">not a problem that needs to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.980" end="00:12:19.170" style="s2">because think them at the the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.589" end="00:12:22.920" style="s2">picture is things improve basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.170" end="00:12:25.110" style="s2">every year yeah you know that is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.920" end="00:12:27.720" style="s2">perspective I think that comes with age</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:30.570" style="s2">when I have these conversations with my</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.720" end="00:12:32.640" style="s2">mother no I&#39;m 44 so I&#39;m not young but</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.570" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">when I have these questions with my mom</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.640" end="00:12:37.140" style="s2">she always takes those like 10 steps</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.550" style="s2">back and she&#39;s like I has just been like</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.140" end="00:12:40.020" style="s2">that forever and look where we are now</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.550" end="00:12:42.209" style="s2">everything&#39;s gonna be just fine don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.020" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">you worry about it but then you know you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.209" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">get focused on the minutia and you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.610" end="00:12:49.529" style="s2">you experience like for example I went</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:52.890" style="s2">to the Richmond Second Amendment gun</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.529" end="00:12:56.010" style="s2">rally on January 20th and while I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.890" end="00:12:58.350" style="s2">there everyone was super nice there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.010" end="00:13:00.029" style="s2">a variety of different people diverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.350" end="00:13:02.519" style="s2">groups of people were there everybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.029" end="00:13:04.860" style="s2">had their guns out it was like it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.519" end="00:13:07.110" style="s2">like one one-hundredth of rowdy as any</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.860" end="00:13:08.790" style="s2">NFL football game you&#39;ve ever been to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.110" end="00:13:09.990" style="s2">and it was just like a really lovely</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.790" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">pleasant day</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.990" end="00:13:13.800" style="s2">and then the news reports that came out</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:15.930" style="s2">of it we&#39;re just like look at all these</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.800" end="00:13:17.430" style="s2">racists with their guns what if there</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.930" end="00:13:18.750" style="s2">were black people there with guns what</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.430" end="00:13:20.279" style="s2">would happen then we&#39;ll guess what there</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.750" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">were and they were and they took</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.279" end="00:13:24.180" style="s2">pictures with them and everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.750" end="00:13:26.279" style="s2">super cool and nice and so I left that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.180" end="00:13:29.100" style="s2">experience which I&#39;ve had a number of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.279" end="00:13:30.839" style="s2">times my own personal life being called</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.100" end="00:13:33.420" style="s2">a Nazi and getting fired for it even</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.839" end="00:13:35.580" style="s2">though I was and you know obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.420" end="00:13:38.279" style="s2">each of these times they still still</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.580" end="00:13:41.580" style="s2">managed to you know cause us really</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.279" end="00:13:44.730" style="s2">severe just I get incensed though a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.580" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">little bit I&#39;ve really agitated because</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.730" end="00:13:49.860" style="s2">I feel like this is something that needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">to be resolved we need to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">facts and and things the same way so</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.200" end="00:13:56.100" style="s2">that we can come together we can do</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:57.660" style="s2">happy but that&#39;s what you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.100" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">this what I&#39;m saying yeah you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.660" end="00:14:03.029" style="s2">no no they&#39;re all evidence suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:05.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to agree on reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.029" end="00:14:07.620" style="s2">because we have you know thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.820" end="00:14:10.770" style="s2">years of civilization and which we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.620" end="00:14:11.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t we got this are I mean we made</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.770" end="00:14:13.320" style="s2">it this far</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.520" end="00:14:15.029" style="s2">with all of those flaws and it made no</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.320" end="00:14:17.130" style="s2">difference at all now do you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.029" end="00:14:19.230" style="s2">perhaps these circumstances are</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.130" end="00:14:21.390" style="s2">different given the prevalence of social</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.230" end="00:14:25.529" style="s2">media and Technology</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.390" end="00:14:28.440" style="s2">I read her Aires or Harvey sapiens book</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.529" end="00:14:30.600" style="s2">and in there he talks about how our</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.440" end="00:14:33.270" style="s2">societies coalesced around him shared</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.600" end="00:14:35.520" style="s2">imagined orders and then I read a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.270" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">of technologists and and and media</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.520" end="00:14:40.470" style="s2">specialists today that talk about how in</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:42.660" style="s2">the old days we had a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.470" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">information distribution system where</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.660" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">Walter Cronkite would tell us all what</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:48.810" style="s2">to think and feel at night and we were</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.459" style="s2">all unified and we had cohesion today</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.810" end="00:14:52.980" style="s2">now because the liberation of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.459" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">communication via technology we are not</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.980" end="00:14:56.310" style="s2">talking one-to-many we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:58.770" style="s2">many-to-many and therefore there&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.310" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">million different imagine orders and now</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.770" end="00:15:02.010" style="s2">we don&#39;t share in those imagined orders</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:03.750" style="s2">in the way that we did and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.010" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">we&#39;re now seeing a breakdown in social</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.750" end="00:15:09.870" style="s2">cohesion well any weight to that well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:12.690" style="s2">would modify that by saying that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.870" end="00:15:14.250" style="s2">two dominant at least political views</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.690" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.250" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">and I&#39;ve always said that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">form political opinions on their own</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">opinions are assigned to them by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.020" end="00:15:25.140" style="s2">dominant media</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:28.680" style="s2">now if you ask somebody they say well</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.140" end="00:15:31.080" style="s2">it&#39;s my opinion but here&#39;s the tell it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.680" end="00:15:34.350" style="s2">always matches their preferred news</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.080" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">source always so you know you could take</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.350" end="00:15:39.750" style="s2">almost any negative story about Trump</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:42.120" style="s2">and say okay let&#39;s just try to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.750" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">that this had been reported as just the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.120" end="00:15:45.900" style="s2">facts would no opinion Laird on what</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">would you think about it and you would</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.900" end="00:15:50.450" style="s2">find that almost everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:52.980" style="s2">alarming and scary and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.450" end="00:15:54.500" style="s2">completely inappropriate and everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.980" end="00:15:57.089" style="s2">else about Trump whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.500" end="00:15:58.440" style="s2">complaint they&#39;re bringing today you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.089" end="00:16:01.230" style="s2">would find that almost all of it would</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.440" end="00:16:03.420" style="s2">just go away if all you did is describe</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.230" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">what he did instead of having the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.420" end="00:16:07.860" style="s2">pundits come and say well what he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:11.220" style="s2">thinking or or where this will lead us</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.860" end="00:16:13.650" style="s2">to or what he really means but didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.220" end="00:16:16.140" style="s2">say it&#39;s all that stuff they divides us</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.650" end="00:16:18.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not what he actually does right but</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.140" end="00:16:20.790" style="s2">I think in this in this argument people</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.360" end="00:16:23.010" style="s2">are talking about how it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.790" end="00:16:24.900" style="s2">dominant news media that are creating</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.010" end="00:16:27.089" style="s2">new narratives for us</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.900" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">for example our mutual friend Mike Serna</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.089" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">Mitch he&#39;s very successful at creating</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.490" style="s2">media narratives and they of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">spread into larger institutions and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.490" end="00:16:37.320" style="s2">people get it from there but there is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:38.760" style="s2">element now I think of a you know we</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.320" end="00:16:40.680" style="s2">were sort of like in a unipolar</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.760" end="00:16:42.600" style="s2">communication world and now we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.680" end="00:16:44.279" style="s2">this multipolar world where everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.600" end="00:16:46.620" style="s2">talking and there&#39;s nodes everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.279" end="00:16:49.709" style="s2">I I just wonder if it&#39;s not so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.620" end="00:16:52.440" style="s2">dismiss this notion that failing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.709" end="00:16:55.470" style="s2">maintain a shared imagined world order</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.440" end="00:16:57.240" style="s2">or shared ideas of who we are in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.470" end="00:16:59.010" style="s2">head because in America at least we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.240" end="00:17:01.950" style="s2">very much our identity is based on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.010" end="00:17:04.679" style="s2">shared idea rather than shared genetics</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.950" end="00:17:06.900" style="s2">or shared bloodlines that in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.679" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">particular case especially since our</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.900" end="00:17:12.780" style="s2">nation is one of ideas that if these</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">ideas are now multiple and diverse and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:16.530" style="s2">coming at you from all directions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.350" style="s2">able to recruit you into smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.530" end="00:17:21.150" style="s2">smaller teams that they may that may</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.350" end="00:17:22.949" style="s2">have a long-term negative effect on</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:26.100" style="s2">social cohesion that we have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.949" end="00:17:27.540" style="s2">been seen before or or positive because</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.100" end="00:17:30.300" style="s2">all this stuff is completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.540" end="00:17:34.650" style="s2">unpredictable but what I said</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.300" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">what I see is it seems like it used to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.650" end="00:17:39.930" style="s2">be a question of you know you got your</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:41.580" style="s2">Democrats against your Republicans then</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.930" end="00:17:44.430" style="s2">of course you had the media that was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.580" end="00:17:47.040" style="s2">big player but I think things because of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.430" end="00:17:49.860" style="s2">social media we now see a battle that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.040" end="00:17:52.530" style="s2">seems to be shaping up between two sides</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.860" end="00:17:55.710" style="s2">one that has money and the other has</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.530" end="00:17:57.690" style="s2">influence now now that you know both</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.710" end="00:18:00.540" style="s2">sides have both some money and some</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.690" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">influence etc but people who were</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.540" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">skilled at influence you know they</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:07.140" style="s2">actually have the tools to influence and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:11.430" style="s2">make sort of itches one I&#39;m another if</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.140" end="00:18:13.560" style="s2">we have a big enough audience we become</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.430" end="00:18:16.380" style="s2">the people who create that shared</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.560" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">imagination yeah I don&#39;t mean just me</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.380" end="00:18:20.460" style="s2">personally but people were influential</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:22.140" style="s2">enough to have big audiences and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.460" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">know they&#39;re good with words and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.140" end="00:18:26.520" style="s2">understand persuasion so they can you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:29.240" style="s2">know package their words just right it</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.520" end="00:18:32.790" style="s2">makes things viral I mean if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.240" end="00:18:35.580" style="s2">you know Jack pasaba k-- mics or in a</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:20:00.690" style="s2">and how much of that is out of jealousy</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:02.549" style="s2">or fear and and I want to circle back</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.690" end="00:20:03.960" style="s2">later to this idea of fear I feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.549" end="00:20:07.080" style="s2">lot of us are motivated we&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.080" end="00:20:13.950" style="s2">what extent is there backlash based on</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.480" end="00:20:15.270" style="s2">fear or jealousy and if so and talking</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.910" end="00:20:26.760" style="s2">continue on a trajectory slippery slope</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:28.950" style="s2">just kidding a trajectory like this what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.760" end="00:20:31.950" style="s2">is that what what could happen when</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.950" end="00:20:34.710" style="s2">people with money see their influence</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.950" end="00:20:36.330" style="s2">slipping they don&#39;t like that well</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.330" end="00:20:39.660" style="s2">who have influence so I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:41.970" style="s2">that they&#39;re gonna try to buy whatever</p>
