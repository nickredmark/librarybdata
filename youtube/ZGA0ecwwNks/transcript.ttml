<p begin="00:00:03.570" end="00:00:07.529" style="s2">hour-long conversation we bring</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.150" end="00:00:09.120" style="s2">ourselves that are biased everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.529" end="00:00:10.710" style="s2">else to the conversations so all of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.120" end="00:00:12.300" style="s2">experience everything that you bring but</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.710" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">the idea is to generate something new</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.300" end="00:00:16.379" style="s2">not necessarily hold on to something we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">had before coming to the conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.379" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">this is to run parallel to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">conversation game be had last week</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">although both of you attended you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.029" style="s2">welcome to bring what was what happened</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">there into the conversation but it is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.029" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t there that&#39;s why I can&#39;t build</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">on what was done there it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">parallel and anyone can watch it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">decide what they want to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">mapping game B this issue has come up</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">consistently in game B is how do you map</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:42.629" style="s2">it how does somebody new understand it</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:44.610" style="s2">how does this is the first time we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.629" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">done a solution raising on game beats</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">specifically where people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">maybe it wouldn&#39;t be able to really</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">participate so we spend 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">talking about what&#39;s currently being</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:56.250" style="s2">done 15 minutes talking about what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">would like an art ideal version of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.250" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">future and then we spend half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">usually talking about we could do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:04.860" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 for this</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">particular solution raising because game</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have 10,000 people and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">focusing on game B I&#39;m gonna say with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:16.979" style="s2">thousand people and $10,000 also with</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">the ingenuity that&#39;s in game B right I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.979" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">think there are people who are willing</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:22.200" style="s2">to do some of the labor for free so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:23.549" style="s2">don&#39;t need to if I have $100,000 so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">going to change in the parameter so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.549" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">something that could happen in game</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">because again we don&#39;t have 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">people and what we could still stick</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:31.880" style="s2">with $100,000 but then would be everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">putting in $100 I think this a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.880" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll play with that when we get there</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">so for the first part we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">about what is Curt what is getting map</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">being game B currently look like and why</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:46.020" style="s2">it keeps being a topic that we need we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">need to talk about so you can each take</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.020" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">a turn to share or you can pass it you</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">don&#39;t want to share for that for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">portion then we can have an open</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">discussion for the remainder of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:56.119" style="s2">time and when it feels right transfer on</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">to the next part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.119" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">again the first 15 minutes or other 10</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">minutes about we&#39;ll be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">what is currently being done to math</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">game B and why we feel we need something</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">currently what&#39;s good and bad about</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">what&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.860" end="00:02:16.010" style="s2">either you would like to start since I</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:17.660" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there last week I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.010" end="00:02:22.310" style="s2">know it&#39;s currently being done and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.660" end="00:02:25.460" style="s2">gonna talk okay so what is currently</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.310" end="00:02:31.630" style="s2">being done I am to be honest not sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.460" end="00:02:36.140" style="s2">apart from Adrian&#39;s quick project mmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.630" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">least application but apart from that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.140" end="00:02:45.470" style="s2">did not find any specific like</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:49.610" style="s2">encompassing all-encompassing library or</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.470" end="00:02:54.950" style="s2">catalogue of projects groups individuals</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.610" end="00:02:56.420" style="s2">and I understand that it&#39;s because first</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.950" end="00:03:00.580" style="s2">there is no clear definition of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.420" end="00:03:04.300" style="s2">Lane B is and what criteria there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.580" end="00:03:08.360" style="s2">for a define and determining if</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.300" end="00:03:13.610" style="s2">something is then B is something between</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.360" end="00:03:22.970" style="s2">there named a Lane a game B and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.610" end="00:03:25.670" style="s2">there is that and and yeah as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.970" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want to define it and write in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.670" end="00:03:33.470" style="s2">stone what exactly we are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:36.650" style="s2">and what exactly is going be in I guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.470" end="00:03:38.840" style="s2">the concern there are many concerns</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:41.330" style="s2">about it so we don&#39;t want this but at</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.840" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">the same time the projects that are out</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.330" end="00:03:47.540" style="s2">there are real and you would very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:51.770" style="s2">like to know about them and have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.540" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">sort of like overview maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.770" end="00:04:00.650" style="s2">necessarily of mmm like everything from</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">a specific angle but more like we would</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.650" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">like to know what is out there in very</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:12.320" style="s2">general terms so what is currently</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:18.590" style="s2">banana I know of several projects that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.320" end="00:04:20.359" style="s2">are in a beta stage to be said that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.590" end="00:04:25.270" style="s2">there are many people working on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.359" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">and I did see along those years</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.270" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">phew</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:36.110" style="s2">designs of few descriptions of what such</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:42.430" style="s2">a system would look like but as I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.110" end="00:04:42.430" style="s2">aware there is nothing written yet so</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:51.860" style="s2">James you wanna share um yeah I probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:53.569" style="s2">I feel like I&#39;m also not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.860" end="00:04:57.139" style="s2">probably a lot of the stuff that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.569" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">on related to Macri at the moment but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.139" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">that does seem to be quite a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:03.020" style="s2">popping up and it was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.220" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">in the call last week to see some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.020" end="00:05:06.680" style="s2">projects actually kind of connect into</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">the game be space who are working on</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:12.139" style="s2">different tools that are kind of related</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:16.009" style="s2">to the subject of mapping so one example</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.139" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">is a group called the brain and just to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.009" end="00:05:19.639" style="s2">clarify this because it can be confusing</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:21.470" style="s2">there&#39;s actually two different mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.639" end="00:05:23.110" style="s2">mapping tools called the brain but</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.470" end="00:05:25.970" style="s2">they&#39;re both felt slightly differently</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.110" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">the original one is spelled like the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.970" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">normal way you&#39;d spell the brain and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:30.650" style="s2">new one which the guys who are involved</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:34.370" style="s2">with j-b</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.650" end="00:05:38.150" style="s2">it&#39;s spelled like BR ane like like</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.370" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">membrane or something and yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.150" end="00:05:42.650" style="s2">doing some really interesting work</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.940" end="00:05:44.090" style="s2">there&#39;s also some some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.650" end="00:05:46.099" style="s2">people who kind of came along you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.090" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">just been involved in mind mapping for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.099" end="00:05:52.180" style="s2">long time using for example at the old</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">version of the brain and tools like Kumu</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.180" end="00:05:56.270" style="s2">to kind of plot out you know just even</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:57.620" style="s2">just from a kind of a personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.270" end="00:05:59.330" style="s2">perspective just to map out the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.620" end="00:06:00.889" style="s2">different things that they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.330" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">interested in their life to kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.889" end="00:06:05.300" style="s2">track of stuff different links that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:07.310" style="s2">come across different projects they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">interested in and to kind of organize it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.310" end="00:06:10.159" style="s2">in a framework that makes it easy for</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:14.360" style="s2">them to then go and find that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.159" end="00:06:15.710" style="s2">information and navigate through it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.360" end="00:06:17.570" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot of people that kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:19.009" style="s2">of have an interest in this subject it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.570" end="00:06:22.099" style="s2">seems and there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.009" end="00:06:26.690" style="s2">projects kind of moving pushing the ball</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.099" end="00:06:30.729" style="s2">forward in that space for me I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.690" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">like the value of mapping is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.729" end="00:06:35.839" style="s2">it&#39;s actually relevant to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">different areas so whenever you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.839" end="00:06:40.729" style="s2">situation where there&#39;s a landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:43.089" style="s2">some kind that&#39;s that&#39;s very complex and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.729" end="00:06:46.460" style="s2">filled with lots of different data and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.089" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make sense of that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.460" end="00:06:50.270" style="s2">I think I&#39;m the value of a map is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:53.569" style="s2">it kind of takes all that complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.270" end="00:06:55.639" style="s2">reduces it down to a simple model that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.569" end="00:06:57.499" style="s2">much easier to comprehend and has the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.639" end="00:06:58.879" style="s2">kind of key bits of information that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.499" end="00:07:01.699" style="s2">need to be able to navigate that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.879" end="00:07:03.469" style="s2">landscape so that could be you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.699" end="00:07:05.779" style="s2">rebase ik sense that could be like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.469" end="00:07:08.089" style="s2">physical landscape with just like a you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.779" end="00:07:10.099" style="s2">know a paper map that visualizes where</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.089" end="00:07:12.830" style="s2">the mountains are the villages and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.099" end="00:07:15.939" style="s2">roads or it could be you know mapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.830" end="00:07:21.349" style="s2">something a bit more ephemeral like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.939" end="00:07:22.699" style="s2">social network and visualizing different</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.349" end="00:07:24.559" style="s2">communities and different types of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.699" end="00:07:26.569" style="s2">connections within that space that if</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.559" end="00:07:28.839" style="s2">you didn&#39;t have a map to visualize that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.569" end="00:07:31.279" style="s2">would be very difficult to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.839" end="00:07:33.139" style="s2">and especially to code and navigate</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.279" end="00:07:37.270" style="s2">through so I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.139" end="00:07:40.039" style="s2">of value in maps for that kind of reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.270" end="00:07:41.689" style="s2">but to me this is what I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.039" end="00:07:43.990" style="s2">bringing up in the call last week what</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.689" end="00:07:47.509" style="s2">I&#39;m most excited about with mapping is</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.990" end="00:07:51.620" style="s2">how it can be how people can collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.509" end="00:07:53.689" style="s2">around shared Maps because I think like</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.620" end="00:07:56.120" style="s2">part of the way that our brains work is</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.689" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">that we the way we understand reality in</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.120" end="00:07:59.689" style="s2">the world around us is that we build</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.699" style="s2">maps out of the information that we we</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.689" end="00:08:04.219" style="s2">take it and kind of build models within</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.699" end="00:08:06.979" style="s2">our minds so we&#39;re already I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.219" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">naturally wired to be able to build maps</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.979" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">and to do that in a very kind of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:14.449" style="s2">flexible way but I think what we lack at</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:15.949" style="s2">the moment is the ability to build maps</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.449" end="00:08:18.499" style="s2">in that same kind of way but</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.949" end="00:08:20.449" style="s2">collectively in large groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.499" end="00:08:23.539" style="s2">often dispersed you know across huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.449" end="00:08:26.209" style="s2">distances so I think that&#39;s where that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.539" end="00:08:27.830" style="s2">real potential lies in the future is if</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.209" end="00:08:30.289" style="s2">we can kind of develop tools that enable</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.830" end="00:08:32.360" style="s2">groups that are coordinating around any</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.289" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">different subject to be able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.360" end="00:08:35.870" style="s2">come together and add their little</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:37.849" style="s2">pieces of data that they each have from</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.870" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">their perspectives and have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.849" end="00:08:42.829" style="s2">synthesized in a shared map that takes</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:44.449" style="s2">in all that information and provide</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.829" end="00:08:47.990" style="s2">something that&#39;s very useful to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.449" end="00:08:50.060" style="s2">in terms of kind of coordinating finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.990" end="00:08:53.750" style="s2">out what&#39;s going on and knowing where to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.060" end="00:08:54.649" style="s2">add their contributions so to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:08:56.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.649" end="00:08:58.819" style="s2">there&#39;s a real exciting potential that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.360" end="00:09:01.369" style="s2">to level up group collective</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.819" end="00:09:08.059" style="s2">intelligence through designing the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.369" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">tools thank you I will try to take only</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.059" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">a couple minutes to do it to do mine</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:15.079" style="s2">about the game be space is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">interesting to map because one we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.079" end="00:09:17.629" style="s2">even know what game B is you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:19.879" style="s2">where we&#39;re going we don&#39;t have you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.629" end="00:09:21.499" style="s2">transition to it we don&#39;t we there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.879" end="00:09:24.110" style="s2">many people who have ideas on how we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.499" end="00:09:25.699" style="s2">that but masking those and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.110" end="00:09:29.749" style="s2">how do you do your individual piece to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.699" end="00:09:31.999" style="s2">make sense but in doing so not like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.749" end="00:09:34.490" style="s2">want my sense to add to the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.999" end="00:09:35.660" style="s2">of the group not dissipate it and right</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.490" end="00:09:37.579" style="s2">now because there&#39;s so many people come</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.660" end="00:09:39.619" style="s2">into the game&#39;s peace space and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.579" end="00:09:40.759" style="s2">confused what&#39;s going on what is game B</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.619" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">so I pretend you can answer that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.759" end="00:09:44.179" style="s2">question let alone what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:46.129" style="s2">here who&#39;s involved what are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.179" end="00:09:46.819" style="s2">projects and so there&#39;s a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.129" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.819" end="00:09:50.389" style="s2">what is game B some of us it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:51.589" style="s2">conversation or some of us it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.389" end="00:09:53.149" style="s2">personal work some of us it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.589" end="00:09:55.399" style="s2">project work and I think it&#39;s all of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.149" end="00:09:57.259" style="s2">above so to be able to have somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.399" end="00:09:58.790" style="s2">come and be new and be like right</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.259" end="00:10:00.019" style="s2">where&#39;s the gas station you need to pull</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.790" end="00:10:01.459" style="s2">out the map and say here&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.019" end="00:10:03.139" style="s2">and here&#39;s where we need to go and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.459" end="00:10:06.649" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.139" end="00:10:09.439" style="s2">really I think we need to take a step</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.649" end="00:10:11.540" style="s2">back and brainstorm what we would want</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.439" end="00:10:12.769" style="s2">mapped before we ever map and the PERT</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.540" end="00:10:13.910" style="s2">the problem is is everyone&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.769" end="00:10:15.350" style="s2">their own map and it&#39;s never really</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.910" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">gonna be able to be used by somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.350" end="00:10:20.089" style="s2">else because we orient differently there</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.040" style="s2">is no north-south east-west here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.089" end="00:10:25.009" style="s2">gas station here&#39;s here&#39;s how you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.040" end="00:10:26.569" style="s2">there it&#39;s well my version of game B is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.009" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">this we do this with currency and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.569" end="00:10:28.999" style="s2">with governance and it&#39;s okay if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:30.860" style="s2">is this different but we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.999" end="00:10:34.879" style="s2">towards that and what is the next step</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.860" end="00:10:36.769" style="s2">and so having the conversation like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.879" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">was just writing down here in the game B</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.769" end="00:10:40.730" style="s2">space they gave you Facebook groups</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:43.459" style="s2">there&#39;s already three that really are</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.730" end="00:10:45.379" style="s2">mapping there&#39;s game B wiki which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.459" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">dealing with all the same things but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.379" end="00:10:49.549" style="s2">came to a standstill because the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:50.809" style="s2">the wiki is that it does all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.549" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">right it&#39;s the tools it tells us what</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.809" end="00:10:53.689" style="s2">projects it tell us with people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:57.319" style="s2">together tech which I&#39;m involved in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.689" end="00:10:58.879" style="s2">Patricius is is involved in of okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.319" end="00:11:00.649" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing our projects together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.879" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">figure you know how can we create all</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.649" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">new in solutions for our project so they</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:06.799" style="s2">can get out in the world but the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">issues keep coming up of how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.799" end="00:11:09.589" style="s2">what&#39;s going on how do you under</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:11.029" style="s2">Alma can be is and I think it isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.589" end="00:11:13.670" style="s2">documents it is a bunch of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.029" end="00:11:15.350" style="s2">understanding of definitions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.670" end="00:11:19.579" style="s2">multiple definitions for each word and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.350" end="00:11:21.199" style="s2">multiple courses and to honor and truly</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.579" end="00:11:23.329" style="s2">get that there&#39;s complexity and no</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.199" end="00:11:25.069" style="s2">single map can actually be the full</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.329" end="00:11:26.569" style="s2">thing and so there&#39;s gonna be things</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.069" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">other people have on their map that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.569" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">don&#39;t have on yours because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:31.160" style="s2">care about gas stations you don&#39;t drive</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:33.740" style="s2">by date and there&#39;s other things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.160" end="00:11:36.649" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have that or comment and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.740" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">that to me is right now it feels</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.649" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">confusing to be a new person and game be</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:42.379" style="s2">even not being a new person game be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.300" style="s2">when you come in it&#39;s like well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.379" end="00:11:47.000" style="s2">going on where can I be what can what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.300" end="00:11:50.180" style="s2">what conversations can I attend what</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.000" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">conversations can i watch what projects</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.180" end="00:11:53.449" style="s2">can I be part of how do I create a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:54.740" style="s2">project how do we create project</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.449" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">together how do we work through even not</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.740" end="00:12:00.379" style="s2">being together right and so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:12:01.850" style="s2">very fertile ground for complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.379" end="00:12:03.800" style="s2">mapping complexity and working through</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.850" end="00:12:04.670" style="s2">this as a group and having it be that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.800" end="00:12:06.740" style="s2">there&#39;s all this different stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.670" end="00:12:08.720" style="s2">happening like there&#39;s missing there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.740" end="00:12:10.459" style="s2">wiki there&#39;s the map newer mapping</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:12.829" style="s2">Facebook group and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.459" end="00:12:15.110" style="s2">technology tools which are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.829" end="00:12:17.240" style="s2">looking at what&#39;s already out there that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.110" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">we can use in game B but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.240" end="00:12:20.899" style="s2">they come up constantly right like the</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:26.899" style="s2">and you try to understand what projects</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.899" end="00:12:32.990" style="s2">that and it feels like we never get</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.379" end="00:12:35.540" style="s2">beyond beta because there&#39;s so many</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.980" end="00:12:41.240" style="s2">many people are mapping but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">ton of people who have a project of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.240" end="00:12:45.139" style="s2">projects Janelle has one I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.569" style="s2">remember the name of perhaps you know I</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.709" end="00:12:54.470" style="s2">competing things and none of them have</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.470" end="00:12:57.230" style="s2">transition to the next part of the topic</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.939" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">which is what do we want it to look like</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.230" end="00:13:00.949" style="s2">and our idea version of the future if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.059" style="s2">came together and truly match game beat</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.949" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">whatever that means to us is an</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.059" end="00:13:06.620" style="s2">individual what does that look like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:08.600" style="s2">us and this portion of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.620" end="00:13:10.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to match it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.600" end="00:13:12.019" style="s2">democracy if James&#39;s version of a map</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.490" end="00:13:14.750" style="s2">looks for them and - sizzles - friend of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.019" end="00:13:16.250" style="s2">mine that&#39;s totally fine it&#39;s what could</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.750" end="00:13:18.170" style="s2">it look like right it&#39;s the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.250" end="00:13:19.300" style="s2">we&#39;re all feeling different pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.170" end="00:13:21.010" style="s2">instead of arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.300" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">right it&#39;s like putting those pieces</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.010" end="00:13:25.990" style="s2">together to get the elephant this in for</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:27.880" style="s2">this solution racing even more so than</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.990" end="00:13:29.890" style="s2">the rest so whoever would like to share</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.880" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">their version of what their ideal</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.890" end="00:13:34.990" style="s2">version of mapping game B looks like in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:43.540" style="s2">the future whether that&#39;s tomorrow or</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.990" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">five years ago I think I liked what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.540" end="00:13:48.130" style="s2">said like I think a really key part is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:50.650" style="s2">that when people come to game B it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.130" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">just having a very clear roadmap of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.650" end="00:13:55.210" style="s2">how to find our way to what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.590" style="s2">so that they can actually find their way</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.210" end="00:13:58.300" style="s2">into these different subjects and if</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.590" end="00:13:59.590" style="s2">they&#39;ve got you know if they&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.300" end="00:14:01.990" style="s2">kind of gem that they&#39;ve got to give</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.590" end="00:14:03.220" style="s2">just making sure that it&#39;s very easy for</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.990" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2">them to find where they&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.220" end="00:14:08.260" style="s2">appropriate place where that is to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:11.590" style="s2">shared and I&#39;ve just noted down here a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.260" end="00:14:14.860" style="s2">couple things like to me an ideal map</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.590" end="00:14:17.410" style="s2">would would one aspect would be that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.860" end="00:14:19.510" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of fractal so you could have</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.410" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">knit kind of high level map it takes you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.510" end="00:14:24.400" style="s2">to the main sections of game B then as</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:25.660" style="s2">you navigate down to those areas it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.400" end="00:14:27.310" style="s2">like a fractal and you could kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.660" end="00:14:31.660" style="s2">down to some more smaller smaller</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.310" end="00:14:33.820" style="s2">details so I think in that sense you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.660" end="00:14:35.950" style="s2">could actually have a single overarching</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.820" end="00:14:38.200" style="s2">map that kind of integrates all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.950" end="00:14:41.470" style="s2">different smaller and smaller areas that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.200" end="00:14:43.090" style="s2">you could find within game B another</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.470" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">aspect of it for me that I think would</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.090" end="00:14:47.980" style="s2">be really key is is making it as</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:50.080" style="s2">flexible as possible so kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.980" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">back to your point that you know if if</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.080" end="00:14:53.170" style="s2">we&#39;re to keep creating kind of separate</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:55.990" style="s2">Maps but they&#39;re very much like</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.170" end="00:14:57.340" style="s2">customized to our preferences then their</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.990" end="00:14:59.860" style="s2">value to other people is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.340" end="00:15:03.280" style="s2">quite limited so if we can create maps</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.860" end="00:15:06.520" style="s2">that have the give users the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.280" end="00:15:08.020" style="s2">kind of customize how they&#39;re viewed so</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.520" end="00:15:09.640" style="s2">that they can kind of they can highlight</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.020" end="00:15:12.640" style="s2">different aspects of the map maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.640" end="00:15:14.770" style="s2">they&#39;re interested in and you know even</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.640" end="00:15:16.900" style="s2">down to things like potentially even</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.770" end="00:15:20.500" style="s2">customizing the UI so they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.900" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">see it in a different way I think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.500" end="00:15:25.450" style="s2">would make it more accessible to a wider</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">range of people so yes those two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.450" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:39.020" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to tell what should be on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.080" end="00:15:45.080" style="s2">map because who because we are not 100%</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.020" end="00:15:47.060" style="s2">sure what it is we are mapping so I also</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.080" end="00:15:50.180" style="s2">wanted to point out that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.060" end="00:15:52.370" style="s2">important what we don&#39;t map and what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.180" end="00:15:59.959" style="s2">leave out of the big picture</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.370" end="00:16:05.240" style="s2">well scene could be okay what I loved it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.959" end="00:16:11.959" style="s2">what I thought it could start with in</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.240" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">the most simple way so users who are new</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.959" end="00:16:19.070" style="s2">to the space are not lost immediately in</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:23.870" style="s2">the you know forest of ideas ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.070" end="00:16:26.209" style="s2">and high-level descriptions of what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.870" end="00:16:31.339" style="s2">wrong with they may and what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.209" end="00:16:34.600" style="s2">done like for example many people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.339" end="00:16:38.209" style="s2">come to the space do come here because</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.600" end="00:16:40.700" style="s2">they perceive something being around</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.209" end="00:16:43.900" style="s2">with capitalism and they are very anti</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.700" end="00:16:47.720" style="s2">something so they would expect a map of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.900" end="00:16:51.260" style="s2">tools to destroy some economic system as</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.720" end="00:16:56.450" style="s2">they see being not fit to rule the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.260" end="00:16:59.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s not third so if I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.450" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">start small I&#39;ll start with set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.630" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">well-defined problems that can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.020" end="00:17:12.620" style="s2">ascribed to like can be viewed as game</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:16.280" style="s2">be solutions or ideas but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.620" end="00:17:18.829" style="s2">time that not necessarily need this</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.280" end="00:17:21.410" style="s2">whole concept of the envy being present</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.829" end="00:17:23.959" style="s2">at all it for example we know that food</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.410" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">and water are problematic especially in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.959" end="00:17:31.370" style="s2">certain parts of the world so if there</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:35.390" style="s2">was a webpage describing various ideas</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.370" end="00:17:39.290" style="s2">about how to clean water that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.390" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">gained be on one hand as we see them be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.290" end="00:17:43.490" style="s2">but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:45.409" style="s2">for someone who is new they would see</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.490" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">okay this is solution for one particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.409" end="00:17:51.409" style="s2">problem that we can all agree that it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:56.659" style="s2">the problem it is real and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.409" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">dealt with in local communities in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.659" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">open-source way and generally yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.870" end="00:18:13.639" style="s2">using non game a solutions and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:17.510" style="s2">dealing with problems so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.639" end="00:18:20.360" style="s2">one thing and then it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.510" end="00:18:26.120" style="s2">there are just few groups of problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.360" end="00:18:28.870" style="s2">that we need to deal with and like I</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.120" end="00:18:32.679" style="s2">said something like before the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.870" end="00:18:35.210" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s pyramid food water shelter</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.679" end="00:18:38.750" style="s2">communication electricity like power</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.210" end="00:18:44.059" style="s2">stuff like that and they all have their</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.750" end="00:18:47.450" style="s2">own define sets of subproblems and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.059" end="00:18:50.840" style="s2">all can fractally expand from like okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.450" end="00:18:54.260" style="s2">we need there&#39;s problem with power as in</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.840" end="00:18:59.240" style="s2">electricity and then there are solutions</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.260" end="00:19:05.690" style="s2">and just open like a tree like no flower</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.240" end="00:19:08.330" style="s2">tree and it could be visualized in of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.690" end="00:19:15.139" style="s2">course 3d space as we discussed on this</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.330" end="00:19:19.250" style="s2">big big meeting about mapping and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.139" end="00:19:21.500" style="s2">the brain one or the other and various</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.250" end="00:19:24.019" style="s2">other solutions that deal with mapping</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.500" end="00:19:27.220" style="s2">they will be very useful in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.019" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">area but they are not complete enough to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.220" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">to be sufficient to like not only</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">visualize everything but only have</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:42.919" style="s2">additional okay I&#39;m getting ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:47.649" style="s2">myself I think that because details not</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.919" end="00:19:50.899" style="s2">needed at this point so yeah fractal</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.649" end="00:19:54.060" style="s2">tree like structure that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.899" end="00:19:55.730" style="s2">like to see and that is what would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.060" end="00:19:57.810" style="s2">the least confusing to new people</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.730" end="00:20:03.210" style="s2">because it would start with okay the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.810" end="00:20:06.630" style="s2">problem is water and solutions ABCD and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.210" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">then each of the solutions will have</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.630" end="00:20:21.780" style="s2">their own set of like more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:24.750" style="s2">detailed way of explaining so my person</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.780" end="00:20:28.020" style="s2">I&#39;m Jane be mapped in my NGO world is</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.670" end="00:20:42.120" style="s2">can they find their teams of people how</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:43.770" style="s2">can they find what projects would most</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:50.220" style="s2">and also the team would most be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.700" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">use them what I was doing here and Ryan</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.220" end="00:20:56.340" style="s2">was this idea between its map so having</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">where we are we might be in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.340" end="00:20:59.160" style="s2">with but that we&#39;re starting somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:00.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.160" end="00:21:01.470" style="s2">thing called capitalism this thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.360" end="00:21:03.210" style="s2">called game and this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.470" end="00:21:05.040" style="s2">history and we might absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.210" end="00:21:07.020" style="s2">different-- what&#39;s broken about what</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.040" end="00:21:09.330" style="s2">right now but that&#39;s okay we also might</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.020" end="00:21:10.920" style="s2">differ on what game B actually is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.330" end="00:21:12.660" style="s2">does constitute game B I think it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.920" end="00:21:14.190" style="s2">of these interlocking circles that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.660" end="00:21:16.710" style="s2">different depending on who you are so</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.190" end="00:21:18.090" style="s2">for me it&#39;s all new in solutions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.710" end="00:21:20.370" style="s2">concentrating on the anti rival</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.090" end="00:21:21.810" style="s2">resolutions that actually getting better</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.370" end="00:21:23.250" style="s2">the more people are involved the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.810" end="00:21:25.080" style="s2">scalability and being a natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:27.960" style="s2">attractor and out competing game a at</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.080" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s in its own its own field for other</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.960" end="00:21:32.340" style="s2">people it&#39;s not all it&#39;s part of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.470" style="s2">but not all of that and so for me game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.340" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">is kind of the sweet spot of long by</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.470" end="00:21:38.520" style="s2">Venn diagrams but really game B is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">all of our interpret actually circles</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.520" end="00:21:42.600" style="s2">together and showcasing like what James</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:45.540" style="s2">had to say that having to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.600" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">individualistic the UI being what I see</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.540" end="00:21:50.520" style="s2">can be in develop individualized me but</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.240" style="s2">understanding the complexity I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">almost like a choose-your-own-adventure</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.240" end="00:21:56.010" style="s2">like here&#39;s where I think we&#39;re broken</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">right like like my version of the map</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.010" end="00:21:59.400" style="s2">could be where we&#39;re starting where I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.370" style="s2">want to get to and then the many</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.400" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">different paths they could get us there</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.370" end="00:22:06.660" style="s2">it&#39;s somehow mapping that so that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.890" style="s2">individual has access to their best</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.660" end="00:22:09.240" style="s2">information about where we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.890" end="00:22:11.850" style="s2">how they understand it their best</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.240" end="00:22:13.290" style="s2">version of this this idea in the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.850" end="00:22:15.690" style="s2">of this ideal world we&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.290" end="00:22:17.730" style="s2">get to because utopias aren&#39;t possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.690" end="00:22:20.970" style="s2">because you&#39;re maximizing it for your</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.730" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">values the path to getting there is like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.970" end="00:22:24.450" style="s2">this magical just everyone having that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:25.950" style="s2">vision and starting from where they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.450" end="00:22:27.810" style="s2">instead of arguing about where we</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.950" end="00:22:30.750" style="s2">starting over yet - we just start moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.810" end="00:22:33.750" style="s2">it actually weaves together to be game B</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.750" end="00:22:35.790" style="s2">but not only show things within the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.750" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">doing of it it is the different people</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.790" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">working on different projects and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:41.550" style="s2">figuring out the the fractured nests of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.680" style="s2">it it isn&#39;t fractal it&#39;s fractured and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.550" end="00:22:45.240" style="s2">then making the fractured fractal and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.680" end="00:22:47.580" style="s2">constantly B instead of it being</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.240" end="00:22:49.710" style="s2">everyone&#39;s dissipated hey where did it</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.580" end="00:22:50.820" style="s2">we&#39;re why do you feel that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.710" end="00:22:52.290" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on what would</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.820" end="00:22:54.090" style="s2">make it make sense to you like having</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.290" end="00:22:55.560" style="s2">the feedback in it for what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.090" end="00:22:57.960" style="s2">working so that it continually be</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.560" end="00:23:00.780" style="s2">improved for everybody and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.960" end="00:23:03.990" style="s2">is a bit of what mine would would look</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.780" end="00:23:08.460" style="s2">like that&#39;s the best summary I heard</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.990" end="00:23:19.230" style="s2">about game B space is just making the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.460" end="00:23:22.740" style="s2">fractured fractal yeah because now we</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.230" end="00:23:27.300" style="s2">have all this shards of good wheel</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.740" end="00:23:31.560" style="s2">energy skills and they are just not</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.300" end="00:23:34.350" style="s2">connected so the way I see this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.560" end="00:23:37.080" style="s2">project it would be not even there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.350" end="00:23:40.500" style="s2">many different aspects of this that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.080" end="00:23:43.860" style="s2">one meeting is not going to cover even a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.500" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">small amount of it but in short there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:47.790" style="s2">not only the mapping aspect the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:49.800" style="s2">knowledge of what&#39;s out there there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.790" end="00:23:53.130" style="s2">the connectivity aspect as well there</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.800" end="00:23:56.160" style="s2">was this enabling that is talking to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.130" end="00:24:06.090" style="s2">everyone involved who might be involved</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.160" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">would like to be involved and yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.090" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">exciting yeah but I think there is ways</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.210" style="s2">like we because it hasn&#39;t been done</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:15.330" style="s2">before we look at it like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.210" end="00:24:17.490" style="s2">chaotic mess that can never happen like</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.330" end="00:24:19.800" style="s2">these conversations never happen until</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.490" end="00:24:21.510" style="s2">they did right we&#39;re able to come up</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.800" end="00:24:23.820" style="s2">with a possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.510" end="00:24:26.039" style="s2">adjacent possible that we could create</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.820" end="00:24:28.529" style="s2">right now with 10,000 people at $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.039" end="00:24:29.639" style="s2">just having the conversation showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.529" end="00:24:30.809" style="s2">it&#39;s possible right well like once</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.639" end="00:24:33.029" style="s2">you&#39;re able to run this is a five-minute</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.809" end="00:24:34.289" style="s2">mile then everyone was here not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.029" end="00:24:37.019" style="s2">but a lot of people are able to break</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.289" end="00:24:39.539" style="s2">the five-minute mile that how mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.019" end="00:24:41.610" style="s2">people showcase what is possible creates</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.539" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">the idea that&#39;s possible cuz game be is</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.610" end="00:24:44.610" style="s2">complex right having everyone have food</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">everyone have water every one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.610" end="00:24:48.090" style="s2">electricity everyone have these on you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:50.639" style="s2">in solutions we have different ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.090" end="00:24:53.460" style="s2">how to get there yeah I do think we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.639" end="00:24:55.830" style="s2">a cop fairly common if if we had let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.460" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">say a hundred game B people brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.830" end="00:24:59.490" style="s2">what are all the things that we need a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:02.100" style="s2">place for you to be living your game B</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.490" end="00:25:04.679" style="s2">we would see that although none of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.100" end="00:25:06.990" style="s2">have exactly the same we all have very</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.679" end="00:25:08.700" style="s2">common overlapping ones like having an a</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.990" end="00:25:10.019" style="s2">tool to assess how do we get water how</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.700" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">do we get food that the best way for</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.019" end="00:25:15.809" style="s2">ourselves right having their information</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">that&#39;s accessible and usable on you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.809" end="00:25:18.840" style="s2">if we&#39;re going through pandemic cope in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:20.130" style="s2">nineteen but like on climate change on</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.840" end="00:25:21.539" style="s2">health care on anything that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.130" end="00:25:23.700" style="s2">dealing with having information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.539" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">usable and accessible and so breaking it</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.700" end="00:25:28.740" style="s2">down in that way so we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:30.779" style="s2">problem and then how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.740" end="00:25:32.639" style="s2">working on solutions and what solution</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.779" end="00:25:34.679" style="s2">offers what and can be you know combine</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.639" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">them and just smacking that mapping</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.679" end="00:25:39.690" style="s2">where we are and how we get to our</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:41.070" style="s2">version of maybe gets us all the game</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.690" end="00:25:43.710" style="s2">because my version might not include</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.070" end="00:25:45.029" style="s2">feeding the world it does but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.710" end="00:25:47.159" style="s2">know why it wouldn&#39;t but right I might</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.029" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">think it&#39;s less important to educate the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.159" end="00:25:53.639" style="s2">world I want everyone have access</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">everything it&#39;s like active mapping it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.639" end="00:26:00.120" style="s2">not only knowledge but it&#39;s only also</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:02.789" style="s2">connectivity and I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.120" end="00:26:06.299" style="s2">common mistake too and it&#39;s very game a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.789" end="00:26:07.769" style="s2">to think that everyone sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.299" end="00:26:10.169" style="s2">connected to some other piece of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.769" end="00:26:11.630" style="s2">information should follow the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.169" end="00:26:14.370" style="s2">manifesto or the same set of values</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.630" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">everyone is in game gain be actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.370" end="00:26:23.429" style="s2">expected to do their own thing by their</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:25.620" style="s2">own rules to some extent maybe on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.429" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">foundation of the same set of values</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.620" end="00:26:31.410" style="s2">more or less because</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:34.410" style="s2">the higher order values seem to be very</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.410" end="00:26:40.280" style="s2">similar between people like all over the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.410" end="00:26:45.630" style="s2">world but yeah by doing their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.280" end="00:26:47.270" style="s2">feeling on like nish of like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.630" end="00:26:49.590" style="s2">be doing this so I&#39;m doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.270" end="00:26:53.160" style="s2">somehow magically disconnected with</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.590" end="00:26:56.039" style="s2">every every scene else let me know</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.160" end="00:26:59.280" style="s2">and everyone what everyone else is doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.039" end="00:27:01.890" style="s2">that by doing their own thing they just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.280" end="00:27:04.500" style="s2">create everyone straight in the den B so</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.890" end="00:27:09.240" style="s2">what we need to say like a platform it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.500" end="00:27:12.539" style="s2">like hmm in the forest that trees like</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.240" end="00:27:15.630" style="s2">lots of trees and on the surface like</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.539" end="00:27:18.950" style="s2">they are not connected maybe they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.630" end="00:27:22.020" style="s2">but you know but underneath the surface</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.950" end="00:27:24.409" style="s2">there is this whole like mycelium thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.020" end="00:27:29.640" style="s2">going on it is vast networks of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.409" end="00:27:34.620" style="s2">information and value exchange that can</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.640" end="00:27:36.299" style="s2">cover like square miles and I see the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.620" end="00:27:39.260" style="s2">platform being something like something</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.299" end="00:27:41.970" style="s2">like this connecting providing</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.260" end="00:27:44.070" style="s2">communication means of means of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.970" end="00:27:47.250" style="s2">coordination and cooperation something</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.070" end="00:27:48.120" style="s2">like this in the most agnostic way</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.250" end="00:27:53.490" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.120" end="00:27:58.260" style="s2">like no ideology no unforeseen a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.490" end="00:28:01.280" style="s2">specific set of worldviews or values</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.260" end="00:28:03.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not what it&#39;s for it&#39;s only for</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.280" end="00:28:07.590" style="s2">making cooperation and communication</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.870" end="00:28:09.710" style="s2">possible you know I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.590" end="00:28:11.820" style="s2">actually the side that for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.710" end="00:28:13.080" style="s2">because Matthew where we are and where</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.820" end="00:28:14.909" style="s2">we need to get to and how we get there</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.080" end="00:28:17.640" style="s2">is very different for every individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.909" end="00:28:17.850" style="s2">and so is sorry I lost my train of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.640" end="00:28:21.150" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.850" end="00:28:26.330" style="s2">are you just a magician having the tools</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.150" end="00:28:26.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember it was great though</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.510" end="00:28:33.750" style="s2">it&#39;ll be back if it&#39;s meant to but that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.740" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">was making me think that actually what</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.750" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">you&#39;re saying which is that one value of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:40.909" style="s2">mapping is that it can can enable it can</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:43.159" style="s2">be a framework but a name</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.909" end="00:28:45.049" style="s2">people to all be acting at they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.159" end="00:28:46.609" style="s2">of individual level doing that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.049" end="00:28:48.679" style="s2">things that they&#39;re interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.609" end="00:28:50.450" style="s2">yet somehow we&#39;ve those contributions</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.679" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">together so that you get something</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.450" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">emerging at the collective level that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:57.409" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be achieved by any of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:59.479" style="s2">individuals alone and they may not even</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.409" end="00:29:01.879" style="s2">be aware of what that bigger picture is</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.479" end="00:29:04.099" style="s2">going to be but by having the right kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.879" end="00:29:05.960" style="s2">of tools and framework it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.099" end="00:29:08.149" style="s2">weave all these different contributions</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.960" end="00:29:11.869" style="s2">together so I think it can be a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.149" end="00:29:15.529" style="s2">like integrating process and I it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.869" end="00:29:17.269" style="s2">the analogy of like similarities to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.529" end="00:29:18.470" style="s2">actually the way our brain works and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.269" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">that you know we build very complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.470" end="00:29:23.389" style="s2">models of the world around us and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">know single neuron is not able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.389" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">the fullness of one of those models it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">only through coordinating those neurons</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:32.809" style="s2">very effectively that you get this</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:35.029" style="s2">capacity to build complex models that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.809" end="00:29:37.190" style="s2">transcend by a long way the capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.029" end="00:29:39.229" style="s2">of any individual neurons so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.190" end="00:29:40.820" style="s2">that&#39;s my kind of like one of my dreams</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.229" end="00:29:42.649" style="s2">with mapping is that you know if we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.820" end="00:29:44.210" style="s2">if we can work out the dynamics and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.649" end="00:29:46.340" style="s2">can build those kind of basic tools</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.210" end="00:29:48.440" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s going to start small and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.340" end="00:29:51.109" style="s2">they&#39;ll probably be a long period where</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.440" end="00:29:53.059" style="s2">it&#39;s being tested and refined but once</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.109" end="00:29:55.220" style="s2">we get that capacity it&#39;s it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.059" end="00:29:56.809" style="s2">isn&#39;t really any scale limits and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.220" end="00:29:58.879" style="s2">could be one of those kind of game B</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.809" end="00:30:01.249" style="s2">technologies where actually the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.879" end="00:30:04.179" style="s2">people that participate I mean the value</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.249" end="00:30:06.169" style="s2">goes up rather than down looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.179" end="00:30:09.769" style="s2">global scale something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.169" end="00:30:12.950" style="s2">have incredibly complex things being</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.769" end="00:30:14.570" style="s2">mapped a very quick speed just by having</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.950" end="00:30:16.340" style="s2">the right tool that everyone can log on</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.570" end="00:30:18.679" style="s2">online can kind of explore the map</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.340" end="00:30:20.029" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s been created already they</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.679" end="00:30:21.409" style="s2">can find the areas that where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.029" end="00:30:22.970" style="s2">blind spots in the map they can add</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.409" end="00:30:24.889" style="s2">their little contributions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.970" end="00:30:26.690" style="s2">everyone&#39;s doing this simultaneously you</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.889" end="00:30:29.529" style="s2">just get this this complex landscape</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.690" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">mapped very quickly through everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.529" end="00:30:37.519" style="s2">collaboration yeah never ever thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:40.340" style="s2">which was to what Matisse had said and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.519" end="00:30:41.929" style="s2">who not to deal with this as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.340" end="00:30:43.309" style="s2">right where individuals living our lives</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.929" end="00:30:45.139" style="s2">so what does it look like at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.309" end="00:30:47.570" style="s2">individual as Jubilee how do I have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.139" end="00:30:49.429" style="s2">moat as much sovereignty as possible the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.570" end="00:30:51.259" style="s2">irony is there&#39;s only so much I can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.429" end="00:30:52.429" style="s2">by myself in sovereignty there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.259" end="00:30:53.950" style="s2">certain amount that we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.429" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">collectively like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:30:57.460" style="s2">and house and clothes I have more</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.559" style="s2">sovereignty do not rely on my government</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.460" end="00:31:00.970" style="s2">to not rely on outside forces and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.559" end="00:31:02.350" style="s2">keep owning that and looking for place</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.970" end="00:31:04.029" style="s2">from where sovereignty and then in</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.350" end="00:31:05.830" style="s2">groups looking at okay how does this</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.029" end="00:31:07.419" style="s2">group have sovereignty how do we decide</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.830" end="00:31:10.870" style="s2">on a collective governance and then have</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.419" end="00:31:13.000" style="s2">the bigger group that group of groups to</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.870" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">know how little Authority do they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.000" end="00:31:16.659" style="s2">on the teams in the individuals right</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:18.870" style="s2">because we are the ones making it up and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.659" end="00:31:20.860" style="s2">there is this difference that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.870" end="00:31:22.840" style="s2">exploring in my own life like the war</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.860" end="00:31:24.730" style="s2">versus the dance and I know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.840" end="00:31:26.230" style="s2">men or with people that I want them to</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.730" end="00:31:27.909" style="s2">do what I want them to do because of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.230" end="00:31:29.889" style="s2">outcome right I want people to stay at</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.909" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">home right now how dare you go out this</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.889" end="00:31:33.220" style="s2">is my but it&#39;s like it&#39;s they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:34.779" style="s2">doing it to spite me and they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.220" end="00:31:36.970" style="s2">it for their own their own best interest</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.779" end="00:31:38.470" style="s2">if I am needing to be in control over</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.970" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">someone&#39;s life even though of course I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.470" end="00:31:41.799" style="s2">don&#39;t have control over their life but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">my being wants to be in control of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.799" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">right I want like new governing rules</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">that will get you to behave in the way I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.409" style="s2">want you to behave instead of how do I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.899" style="s2">behave and when I won with Haven how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.409" end="00:31:55.450" style="s2">we create this society that if there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.899" end="00:31:56.950" style="s2">a good way to be it enables people to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.450" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">that way instead of enforcing it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.950" end="00:32:00.309" style="s2">that is very again the individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:02.260" style="s2">like what is my map and how do I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.309" end="00:32:03.580" style="s2">increase myself how do I find my groups</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.260" end="00:32:05.380" style="s2">how do I help other people find their</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.580" end="00:32:07.899" style="s2">groups and then how can the tools and</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.380" end="00:32:10.029" style="s2">the technology facilitate that and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.899" end="00:32:12.460" style="s2">process without ruling over it right</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.029" end="00:32:13.929" style="s2">without saying you have to do X Y and D</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.460" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">to be part of this to be part of a group</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.929" end="00:32:17.820" style="s2">you might need to but you could always</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:20.470" style="s2">find a different group and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.820" end="00:32:24.250" style="s2">hopefully as few rules as possible over</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.470" end="00:32:27.820" style="s2">the overarching bigger met a group that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.250" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">is facilitated yeah that actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.820" end="00:32:32.139" style="s2">reminded me of a conversation I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.580" style="s2">having with Eric liberate mankind the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.139" end="00:32:36.700" style="s2">other day where we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.580" end="00:32:38.380" style="s2">he&#39;s got this concept of the monarchy he</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.700" end="00:32:40.269" style="s2">calls it which is kind of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.380" end="00:32:44.769" style="s2">balance between the monarchy which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.269" end="00:32:46.120" style="s2">kind of the well from my perspective I</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.769" end="00:32:48.159" style="s2">see it as kind of like representing</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.120" end="00:32:50.350" style="s2">order and then Anarchy representing</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.159" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">chaos although it&#39;s I know the model is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.350" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">more complicated than that but that kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:57.429" style="s2">of simplifies it down but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.610" style="s2">points that came up in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.429" end="00:33:02.620" style="s2">was that if you have you know in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.610" end="00:33:04.659" style="s2">oppressive dictatorships it actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.620" end="00:33:06.190" style="s2">takes an enormous amount of energy to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.659" end="00:33:06.870" style="s2">force people to do things that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.190" end="00:33:09.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.870" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">do you want to do sew it in if you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.660" end="00:33:14.610" style="s2">design a system that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:16.920" style="s2">coordinate people and kind of harness</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:19.830" style="s2">them then doing things that they most</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.920" end="00:33:22.380" style="s2">enjoy you actually as a system become</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.830" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">capable of a huge amount more with much</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.380" end="00:33:28.430" style="s2">less energy expenditure and well so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:31.380" style="s2">kind of like a win-win on all dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.430" end="00:33:33.390" style="s2">and these these kind of systems that try</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.380" end="00:33:36.360" style="s2">to kind of control populations through</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.390" end="00:33:38.280" style="s2">like rigid dictatorial laws and stuff it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.360" end="00:33:40.950" style="s2">can only work temporarily and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.280" end="00:33:42.900" style="s2">fragile because yeah it&#39;s just people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.950" end="00:33:44.460" style="s2">aren&#39;t happy they&#39;re being forced to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.900" end="00:33:46.290" style="s2">what they have to do and that you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.460" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">to employ and pay people to enforce the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.290" end="00:33:51.420" style="s2">other people it&#39;s just enormous waste of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.160" style="s2">energy versus a system that&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.420" end="00:33:56.220" style="s2">coordinate people&#39;s differences and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.160" end="00:33:58.290" style="s2">unique interests so if we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.220" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">and maybe mapping can be a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.290" end="00:34:03.179" style="s2">just helping people you&#39;ve got interests</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">find the place that they can can</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.179" end="00:34:11.730" style="s2">contribute that to the collective that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:14.580" style="s2">interesting on the scale where on one</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.730" end="00:34:16.379" style="s2">extreme there is dictatorship very</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.580" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">centralized which is telling people</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.379" end="00:34:23.610" style="s2">exactly what to do and how and a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:26.389" style="s2">steering Center from central point like</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.610" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2">everything people are unhappy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.389" end="00:34:33.179" style="s2">motivation is very low and the overall</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.270" end="00:34:37.190" style="s2">energy of the system is low and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.179" end="00:34:41.159" style="s2">struggle to get anything done definitely</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.190" end="00:34:44.310" style="s2">those systems tend to not last very long</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.159" end="00:34:49.169" style="s2">or if they do it&#39;s it&#39;s costing like</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.310" end="00:34:53.850" style="s2">enormous amount of blood basically and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.169" end="00:34:57.810" style="s2">then there are systems where yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.850" end="00:35:00.120" style="s2">like the free market metaphor is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.810" end="00:35:02.850" style="s2">appropriate here because what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:05.420" style="s2">about it&#39;s kind of similar it takes the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.850" end="00:35:07.470" style="s2">best of the free market idea which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.420" end="00:35:11.130" style="s2">everyone is doing their thing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.470" end="00:35:13.620" style="s2">somehow magically it produces like great</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.130" end="00:35:17.460" style="s2">results for everyone which is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.620" end="00:35:19.930" style="s2">necessarily true as we see in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.460" end="00:35:23.980" style="s2">there is stuff into it but</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.930" end="00:35:26.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like the shadow of this idea is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.980" end="00:35:30.580" style="s2">also very strong and it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.200" end="00:35:33.580" style="s2">talked too much about yeah whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.580" end="00:35:36.910" style="s2">reason the shadow being that the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.580" end="00:35:42.250" style="s2">line as always people are forced to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.910" end="00:35:46.510" style="s2">what to do something they are free to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.250" end="00:35:50.440" style="s2">choose what work they do but they still</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.510" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">need to do something because of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.440" end="00:35:54.700" style="s2">dynamic of if I don&#39;t work I will not</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:36:00.730" style="s2">have any money and then I will starve</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.700" end="00:36:02.920" style="s2">and game over so there is that and if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.730" end="00:36:06.610" style="s2">took oh yeah and free market is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.920" end="00:36:08.950" style="s2">individualistic the basic thing about</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.610" end="00:36:11.880" style="s2">free market is everyone is like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.950" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">individual and the magic happens between</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.880" end="00:36:17.340" style="s2">individuals on some higher level and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">what we are talking about is more like</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.340" end="00:36:22.540" style="s2">yes everyone is doing our thing but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:25.360" style="s2">also do the thing collectively and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.540" end="00:36:28.030" style="s2">are able to recognize the collectives we</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.360" end="00:36:30.760" style="s2">are in like local communities local are</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.030" end="00:36:34.810" style="s2">you know local but interest groups and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.760" end="00:36:38.110" style="s2">the dynamic in those groups is not based</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.810" end="00:36:44.280" style="s2">on just monetary values not on money</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.110" end="00:36:50.820" style="s2">being passed in any direction just</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.280" end="00:36:53.290" style="s2">thanks best interest yes I think here</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.820" end="00:36:55.630" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna switch over to the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.290" end="00:36:56.680" style="s2">next topic it as much time usually have</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.630" end="00:36:59.290" style="s2">half an hour we all have about 20</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.680" end="00:37:01.570" style="s2">minutes to to explore it of what could</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.290" end="00:37:04.180" style="s2">game be actually create right now if it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.570" end="00:37:05.590" style="s2">had a thousand people like dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.180" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">even just collecting their data and be</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.590" end="00:37:09.460" style="s2">part of a conversation and then what</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.930" end="00:37:12.190" style="s2">could those 1000 people create together</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.460" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">if they were able to volunteer let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.190" end="00:37:16.900" style="s2">three four hours a week month and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:18.130" style="s2">also ten thousand dollars so you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.900" end="00:37:19.510" style="s2">those thousand people putting in ten</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.130" end="00:37:21.280" style="s2">dollars and you also have them</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.510" end="00:37:23.830" style="s2">contributing some of their their</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:25.600" style="s2">intellectual emotional physical labor</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.830" end="00:37:26.980" style="s2">what could we create together and of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.600" end="00:37:28.930" style="s2">course everything&#39;s voluntary so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.980" end="00:37:30.490" style="s2">not like forcing a thousand people to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.930" end="00:37:31.170" style="s2">that what could be created that would</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.490" end="00:37:33.510" style="s2">entice</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.170" end="00:37:36.050" style="s2">would be a natural attractor the game B</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.510" end="00:37:39.450" style="s2">could do that maybe isn&#39;t individuals</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.050" end="00:37:41.460" style="s2">working solely in their own their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.450" end="00:37:43.560" style="s2">interests where that is able to weave</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.460" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">together to be the collective collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.560" end="00:37:47.120" style="s2">benefit so if anyone has any ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:52.830" style="s2">what we could do as an adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.120" end="00:37:54.600" style="s2">maybe mapping I will let you start well</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.830" end="00:37:55.770" style="s2">I think there&#39;s actually already some</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.600" end="00:37:58.500" style="s2">interesting things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.770" end="00:38:00.330" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t even necessarily need an</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.500" end="00:38:02.010" style="s2">injection of cash that they&#39;re just kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.330" end="00:38:04.950" style="s2">of naturally developing like the brain</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.010" end="00:38:07.290" style="s2">project well they&#39;ve already got a kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.950" end="00:38:09.660" style="s2">of a beta product and they&#39;re developing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.290" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">it pretty quickly they&#39;re hoping to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.660" end="00:38:13.830" style="s2">it live so people can test it out fairly</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:16.950" style="s2">soon I&#39;m not sure what the exact date is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.830" end="00:38:19.740" style="s2">but part of their plan is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.950" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">questionnaire which can be shared with</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.740" end="00:38:23.580" style="s2">the game B community that would ask a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.050" end="00:38:24.810" style="s2">bunch of different questions and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.580" end="00:38:28.140" style="s2">actually I&#39;ve got a call with them</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.810" end="00:38:30.150" style="s2">tomorrow and hunter to kind of discuss</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.140" end="00:38:32.340" style="s2">to talk through what would what good</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.150" end="00:38:34.440" style="s2">questions would be to ask people but you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.340" end="00:38:36.060" style="s2">know it could be things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.440" end="00:38:38.550" style="s2">what what subjects do you think are</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.060" end="00:38:40.350" style="s2">relevant to game a or can be what things</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.550" end="00:38:42.360" style="s2">are you personally most interested in</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.350" end="00:38:45.030" style="s2">which ones do you think are most</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.360" end="00:38:47.010" style="s2">relevant versus not relevant and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.030" end="00:38:48.600" style="s2">lots of different types of questions</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.010" end="00:38:50.580" style="s2">that could gather up data from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.600" end="00:38:52.920" style="s2">community and then that could be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.580" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">plotted into a map graph type thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.920" end="00:38:57.210" style="s2">where you know you&#39;ve got all this data</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:58.590" style="s2">suddenly represented in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.210" end="00:39:00.450" style="s2">people can explore through it and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.590" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">can kind of find different communities</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.450" end="00:39:03.060" style="s2">or they could find people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:04.980" style="s2">interested in different things well they</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.060" end="00:39:08.010" style="s2">could kind of get a sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.980" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">collective perspective is of game B just</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.010" end="00:39:12.540" style="s2">through the way that data is visualized</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:14.490" style="s2">so I think stuff like that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.540" end="00:39:16.110" style="s2">already just in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.490" end="00:39:17.370" style="s2">developing and I think in the next year</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.110" end="00:39:20.790" style="s2">we&#39;ll see a few things like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.370" end="00:39:22.920" style="s2">starting to pop up more to me the thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.790" end="00:39:24.570" style="s2">that&#39;s most exciting about it I guess if</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.920" end="00:39:26.460" style="s2">there was you know more participation</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.570" end="00:39:29.160" style="s2">and this kind of continued to develop in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.460" end="00:39:30.750" style="s2">a positive way is that once we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.160" end="00:39:33.630" style="s2">some of those tools in place that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.750" end="00:39:35.460" style="s2">could actually be beneficial to all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.630" end="00:39:37.470" style="s2">different things that game B&#39;s doing so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.460" end="00:39:39.270" style="s2">you know game B projects can be online</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.470" end="00:39:41.850" style="s2">tools all right all these different</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.270" end="00:39:44.890" style="s2">groups they all share the same need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.850" end="00:39:46.930" style="s2">be able to organize the con</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.890" end="00:39:49.180" style="s2">they&#39;re doing allow people to find and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.930" end="00:39:50.650" style="s2">explore through that so I think I see</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.180" end="00:39:52.210" style="s2">that as being like one of the golden</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.650" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">cane mapping is to produce something</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.210" end="00:39:57.850" style="s2">that&#39;s actually useful to all the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:39:59.470" style="s2">groups and to gain B as a whole so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.850" end="00:40:05.890" style="s2">kind of again the air like fractal and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.470" end="00:40:08.890" style="s2">its potential uses yeah ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.890" end="00:40:12.850" style="s2">people can get like produce a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.890" end="00:40:15.220" style="s2">data which is like two things one is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.850" end="00:40:19.180" style="s2">gathering the data and then processing</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.220" end="00:40:21.580" style="s2">and visualizing the data and results so</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.180" end="00:40:23.110" style="s2">ten thousand people could start</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.580" end="00:40:34.270" style="s2">immediately as soon as there is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.110" end="00:40:36.850" style="s2">questionnaire just Philippine yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.270" end="00:40:40.260" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of stuff that can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.850" end="00:40:42.850" style="s2">done it is being done in a space for</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.260" end="00:40:44.530" style="s2">less money that would cost any</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.850" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">individual ones did you learn or less</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.530" end="00:40:47.170" style="s2">it&#39;s just about like not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:49.000" style="s2">dissipating the energy into eight</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.170" end="00:40:50.350" style="s2">different projects and picking which</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.000" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">one&#39;s the best and focusing our energy</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.350" end="00:40:56.680" style="s2">there like one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:58.990" style="s2">could do is with a thousand people is do</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.680" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">something I had kind of talked to when I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.990" end="00:41:02.590" style="s2">first came into the game be space when</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:04.030" style="s2">extinction rebellion was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.590" end="00:41:06.670" style="s2">their citizen assemblies and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.030" end="00:41:08.110" style="s2">why don&#39;t we want why are we fighting</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.670" end="00:41:09.580" style="s2">the streets protesting to get our</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.110" end="00:41:11.650" style="s2">governments to instill citizen</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.580" end="00:41:13.360" style="s2">assemblies were the citizens we can just</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.650" end="00:41:15.910" style="s2">hold assemblies like we could just get</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.360" end="00:41:17.770" style="s2">those people you know gathering the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.910" end="00:41:19.270" style="s2">information on climate change present it</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.770" end="00:41:20.890" style="s2">in a way that it&#39;s understandable for us</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.270" end="00:41:22.420" style="s2">but there&#39;s things we can do without</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.890" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">going through the government and doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.420" end="00:41:27.280" style="s2">something similarly with the thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">people to so that it&#39;s different through</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.280" end="00:41:31.180" style="s2">time zones have zoomed rooms and have it</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:33.580" style="s2">be that we&#39;ve asked these questions</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.180" end="00:41:35.980" style="s2">right instead of it just being a survey</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.580" end="00:41:38.010" style="s2">having conversations about what just</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.980" end="00:41:40.330" style="s2">game fee means me what is game what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.010" end="00:41:41.890" style="s2">what are the subject matters that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.330" end="00:41:43.840" style="s2">think are important and then seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.890" end="00:41:45.730" style="s2">interconnecting circle seeing where you</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.840" end="00:41:46.660" style="s2">know why history is important to me and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.730" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter if history is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.660" end="00:41:49.840" style="s2">important everyone else else if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.060" style="s2">important to me how can I map that on to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.840" end="00:41:54.370" style="s2">game B and how can in Reverse having one</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.060" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">place we can go to both input and get</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.370" end="00:41:58.309" style="s2">the people involved in game being both</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:00.109" style="s2">the the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.309" end="00:42:02.689" style="s2">actually involved right where we&#39;re I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.109" end="00:42:05.269" style="s2">a baby person contact me right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.689" end="00:42:07.400" style="s2">there&#39;s people who maybe aren&#39;t game B</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.269" end="00:42:08.569" style="s2">but their game be adjacent like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.400" end="00:42:09.769" style="s2">Peterson I don&#39;t think this maybe you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.569" end="00:42:11.900" style="s2">been heard about game B but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.769" end="00:42:13.699" style="s2">people follow him and found through here</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.900" end="00:42:15.079" style="s2">right Jordan Paul Moore and Jim Rock</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.699" end="00:42:16.910" style="s2">more game B they they&#39;ve identified</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.079" end="00:42:19.219" style="s2">themselves as game B but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.910" end="00:42:20.719" style="s2">game be adjacent and that people want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.219" end="00:42:24.589" style="s2">watch all of their contents right and do</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.719" end="00:42:26.479" style="s2">that I think having a way to know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.589" end="00:42:27.819" style="s2">been on whose podcast and which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.479" end="00:42:30.019" style="s2">the most important what they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.819" end="00:42:31.519" style="s2">instead of kind of giving everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.019" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">homework in the game B space I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.519" end="00:42:34.999" style="s2">already you first get here there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:37.309" style="s2">many podcasts I mean just to catch up</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.999" end="00:42:38.569" style="s2">but then you realize Kent&#39;s never are</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.309" end="00:42:40.099" style="s2">you gonna be able to watch all in Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.569" end="00:42:41.390" style="s2">of all stuff and all his gym rat stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.099" end="00:42:43.849" style="s2">and you got even watch all my stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.390" end="00:42:46.339" style="s2">I&#39;m not like it&#39;s just too many</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.849" end="00:42:48.680" style="s2">conversations participating in them but</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.339" end="00:42:50.569" style="s2">having someone say hey watch this and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.680" end="00:42:52.579" style="s2">instead of hey everybody watch this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.569" end="00:42:54.019" style="s2">able to actually distill the points to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.579" end="00:42:55.670" style="s2">you so you don&#39;t need to watch it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.019" end="00:42:57.289" style="s2">it&#39;s catalogue so if we need the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.670" end="00:42:59.660" style="s2">relevant parts we can go to it and see</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.289" end="00:43:02.599" style="s2">that and have that be more more relevant</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.660" end="00:43:04.939" style="s2">than both just as people come into game</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.599" end="00:43:06.529" style="s2">B and feel lost having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.939" end="00:43:07.910" style="s2">with them three four months out and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.529" end="00:43:09.439" style="s2">being like what is it that you were</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.910" end="00:43:10.910" style="s2">looking for that we didn&#39;t give you and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.439" end="00:43:12.829" style="s2">then they&#39;re instrumental in helping</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.910" end="00:43:13.880" style="s2">create that for the next three people</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.829" end="00:43:15.439" style="s2">right because if what they were looking</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.880" end="00:43:17.420" style="s2">for was the people they weren&#39;t easily</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.439" end="00:43:19.150" style="s2">able to find them they can help the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.420" end="00:43:22.910" style="s2">group of people by their people right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.150" end="00:43:24.829" style="s2">I think using existing technology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.910" end="00:43:26.719" style="s2">already there like zoom and coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.829" end="00:43:29.299" style="s2">it so that we don&#39;t need to create new</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.719" end="00:43:30.739" style="s2">new technology yet until we have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.299" end="00:43:32.509" style="s2">foundation of what it is we actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.739" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">would want in our game P platform what</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.509" end="00:43:35.900" style="s2">is what are these overarching Solutions</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:37.969" style="s2">of food water clothing what&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.900" end="00:43:40.420" style="s2">being done to pick what is the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.969" end="00:43:42.410" style="s2">powerful project we could do after</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.420" end="00:43:44.390" style="s2">conversation and then actually put</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.410" end="00:43:46.099" style="s2">energy and time into creating that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.390" end="00:43:48.859" style="s2">work through that process together and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.099" end="00:43:50.660" style="s2">even if it falls apart all parties who</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.859" end="00:43:52.519" style="s2">think a lot of them evolve apart is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.660" end="00:43:54.170" style="s2">we learn and if we do that transparently</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.519" end="00:43:57.410" style="s2">we learning grow and it learns and grows</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.170" end="00:44:00.049" style="s2">too and literally start anywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.410" end="00:44:02.719" style="s2">keep improving it is the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.049" end="00:44:04.279" style="s2">everything start somewhere and keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.719" end="00:44:08.150" style="s2">improving it and do so openly and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.279" end="00:44:10.550" style="s2">transparently that would be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.150" end="00:44:13.850" style="s2">questions on the questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.550" end="00:44:17.480" style="s2">about game B and so think about it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.850" end="00:44:19.490" style="s2">what they see like what how did you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.480" end="00:44:22.580" style="s2">here that&#39;s the most obvious and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.490" end="00:44:27.140" style="s2">what piece of information you got you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.580" end="00:44:29.380" style="s2">was most enlightening to you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.140" end="00:44:32.210" style="s2">which part of usually there is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.380" end="00:44:35.150" style="s2">Jordan green house interview with</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.210" end="00:44:37.640" style="s2">someone and then in about nine ten</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.150" end="00:44:42.530" style="s2">minutes in there was this piece about</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.640" end="00:44:44.440" style="s2">how to solve like the problem the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.530" end="00:44:47.450" style="s2">problem of cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.440" end="00:44:50.660" style="s2">incentivization I think it was a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.450" end="00:44:53.600" style="s2">salt those apartments just struck me as</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.660" end="00:44:58.070" style="s2">the most important thing ever in in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.600" end="00:44:59.840" style="s2">space and everyone said ok for me it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.070" end="00:45:02.090" style="s2">this point for me it was this interview</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.840" end="00:45:04.490" style="s2">and this part of it like watch this five</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.090" end="00:45:07.480" style="s2">minutes and you&#39;ll get more than if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.490" end="00:45:09.860" style="s2">watched two hours of someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.480" end="00:45:12.200" style="s2">which might be equally important but</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.860" end="00:45:19.660" style="s2">then the five minutes is what it is all</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.200" end="00:45:23.030" style="s2">about like Matthew has already been done</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.660" end="00:45:25.670" style="s2">makes too much too much information and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.030" end="00:45:27.080" style="s2">knowing what conversations a big</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.670" end="00:45:28.760" style="s2">proponent of conversations know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.080" end="00:45:30.920" style="s2">conversations are going on when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.760" end="00:45:32.450" style="s2">invited to which ones can you watch all</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.920" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">gym rat stuff all Jordan halls it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.450" end="00:45:36.080" style="s2">available it&#39;s definitely there it even</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:37.820" style="s2">in the conversations face in the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.080" end="00:45:39.290" style="s2">spaces what&#39;s what&#39;s there and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.820" end="00:45:40.730" style="s2">want to watch hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.290" end="00:45:42.320" style="s2">hours I want to know what is pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.730" end="00:45:46.730" style="s2">right if I&#39;m looking at competition</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.320" end="00:45:48.320" style="s2">versus cooperation what are the top ten</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.730" end="00:45:48.920" style="s2">talks on that that I could watch for</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.320" end="00:45:50.510" style="s2">five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.920" end="00:45:52.370" style="s2">right what one might be Jordan Hollow</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.510" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">meet Jordan Peterson one might be Eric</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.370" end="00:45:56.450" style="s2">right like it depends on who actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">had the conversation and people we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.450" end="00:46:00.410" style="s2">upload them into and take the videos</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:02.780" style="s2">right be like whoo this is a like at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.410" end="00:46:04.760" style="s2">highlighting right like this part is</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.780" end="00:46:07.310" style="s2">really cool and the more we uploaded it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.760" end="00:46:09.380" style="s2">the more it would gain eyes instead of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.310" end="00:46:10.670" style="s2">just instead of I what I feel often</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.380" end="00:46:11.990" style="s2">happens in the gay be space or people</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.670" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">giving each other homework right</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.990" end="00:46:16.040" style="s2">everyone needs to read this everyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:17.630" style="s2">needs to watch this and like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.040" end="00:46:19.190" style="s2">read what you&#39;re interested in and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.630" end="00:46:20.660" style="s2">bring that to the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.190" end="00:46:22.420" style="s2">your product bring not to the projects</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.660" end="00:46:23.960" style="s2">but if we all have the same information</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.420" end="00:46:27.020" style="s2">that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.960" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">a silver that&#39;s not very like follow</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.020" end="00:46:32.589" style="s2">your interest and then bring those</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:35.510" style="s2">interests to your product</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.589" end="00:46:37.640" style="s2">did you guys see my a chance did you see</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.510" end="00:46:39.470" style="s2">the the tool that Nick had been building</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.640" end="00:46:42.440" style="s2">where you kind of you put in like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.470" end="00:46:44.210" style="s2">YouTube URL and then it scrapes through</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.440" end="00:46:46.490" style="s2">and is able to kind of identify all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.210" end="00:46:48.710" style="s2">most used words and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.490" end="00:46:49.190" style="s2">represents that honor on a graph did you</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.710" end="00:46:53.210" style="s2">guys see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.190" end="00:46:56.270" style="s2">yeah I saw this Legaspi shot off of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.210" end="00:46:58.609" style="s2">and I was most impressed yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.270" end="00:47:00.530" style="s2">really interesting but yeah to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.609" end="00:47:07.730" style="s2">just like a taster of some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.530" end="00:47:09.170" style="s2">that we could and I had no idea he was</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.730" end="00:47:10.670" style="s2">working on stuff like that I&#39;d seen him</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.170" end="00:47:12.530" style="s2">kind of participating in game B and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.670" end="00:47:13.640" style="s2">that popped up and although wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.530" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.640" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s like a way of you</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:21.320" style="s2">know using some software to kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.940" style="s2">a video which would otherwise you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.320" end="00:47:24.849" style="s2">to sit through the whole thing or read a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.940" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">transcript but it just instantly</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.849" end="00:47:30.020" style="s2">visualizes the content of that video and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:31.880" style="s2">like he&#39;s chosen a certain way to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.020" end="00:47:34.070" style="s2">that but you could imagine all different</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.880" end="00:47:35.599" style="s2">kinds of ways of visualizing things pick</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.070" end="00:47:37.940" style="s2">up on different kinds of aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.599" end="00:47:40.250" style="s2">video so I think stuff like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.940" end="00:47:42.740" style="s2">really cool and then another thought I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.250" end="00:47:45.589" style="s2">had was an idea I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.740" end="00:47:47.119" style="s2">awhile ago was you know imagine if as</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.589" end="00:47:49.490" style="s2">you were exploring through the different</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.119" end="00:47:51.349" style="s2">Facebook the game be Facebook group or</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.490" end="00:47:53.660" style="s2">some of its sub groups if you came</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.349" end="00:47:55.430" style="s2">across a post or a comment even and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.660" end="00:47:56.869" style="s2">were like oh that really links well with</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.430" end="00:47:58.730" style="s2">this other post this other comment</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.869" end="00:48:00.260" style="s2">thread that I saw the other day if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.730" end="00:48:01.880" style="s2">could just kind of highlight both of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.260" end="00:48:04.099" style="s2">them somehow and draw a link between</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.880" end="00:48:06.440" style="s2">them and describe that relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.099" end="00:48:08.630" style="s2">then if you imagine everyone was able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.440" end="00:48:10.250" style="s2">do this simultaneously you could start</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.630" end="00:48:13.220" style="s2">building up these kind of networks</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.250" end="00:48:14.830" style="s2">between related content and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.220" end="00:48:17.990" style="s2">that&#39;s like another kind of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.830" end="00:48:21.530" style="s2">related concept that could allow people</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.990" end="00:48:24.650" style="s2">to to kind of help other people find</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.530" end="00:48:27.050" style="s2">stuff and then also enable each other to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.650" end="00:48:28.580" style="s2">explore better if you come across an</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.050" end="00:48:30.080" style="s2">interesting subject you just you can see</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.580" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">straight away that there&#39;s links to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.080" end="00:48:34.150" style="s2">other things that are related to that so</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:35.990" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easier for you to find</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.150" end="00:48:36.770" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s something that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.990" end="00:48:39.770" style="s2">cool thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.770" end="00:48:41.360" style="s2">could I don&#39;t know exactly you know my</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.770" end="00:48:42.770" style="s2">views are on this is that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.360" end="00:48:45.620" style="s2">a lot of these innovations are going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.770" end="00:48:47.780" style="s2">come through Facebook or were many of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.620" end="00:48:49.430" style="s2">these dominant platforms so I still kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.780" end="00:48:53.000" style="s2">of think that we kind of we need some</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.430" end="00:48:54.650" style="s2">other platform so I don&#39;t know how soon</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.000" end="00:48:56.690" style="s2">that&#39;s going to happen but I could just</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.650" end="00:48:57.860" style="s2">see all these different ideas and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.690" end="00:48:59.840" style="s2">know there&#39;s so many people working on</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.860" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">it it just seems inevitable to me that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.840" end="00:49:02.810" style="s2">at some point we are going to make that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:06.560" style="s2">leap and it&#39;s just going to unlock an</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.810" end="00:49:08.510" style="s2">enormous amount of different tools and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.560" end="00:49:10.180" style="s2">features and enable us to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.510" end="00:49:14.900" style="s2">upper-level our collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.180" end="00:49:17.810" style="s2">such a huge amount much she&#39;s learning I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.900" end="00:49:20.630" style="s2">would say could be very useful in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.810" end="00:49:23.420" style="s2">aspect because as much as I trust people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.630" end="00:49:26.180" style="s2">to find links and connections that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:29.540" style="s2">what our brains do after all we are good</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.180" end="00:49:32.420" style="s2">at it not everyone would see the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.540" end="00:49:35.330" style="s2">connections but collectively we can make</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.420" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">something beautiful but if it could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.330" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">helped with some kind of machine</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:45.220" style="s2">learning application whatever stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:50.630" style="s2">that for example the way I visualized it</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.220" end="00:49:54.700" style="s2">if I was in the middle of a graph and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.630" end="00:49:59.590" style="s2">said okay I want to know more about</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.700" end="00:50:07.730" style="s2">governance um watching whatever then</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.590" end="00:50:12.860" style="s2">around straightaway nodes of a nodes but</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.730" end="00:50:19.430" style="s2">with most matching what I just asked the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.860" end="00:50:23.900" style="s2">system to tell me and then by kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.430" end="00:50:25.700" style="s2">weighted proximity think I could I</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.900" end="00:50:28.970" style="s2">should be able to explore further and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.700" end="00:50:33.560" style="s2">further and the connections would the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.970" end="00:50:37.010" style="s2">banks by I think what Nick did stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.560" end="00:50:40.660" style="s2">like this it would be a basis for either</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.010" end="00:50:44.120" style="s2">people doing the matching and thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.660" end="00:50:45.940" style="s2">think Google algorithm works in some</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.120" end="00:50:49.900" style="s2">similar right</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.940" end="00:50:49.900" style="s2">by tracking alright</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.160" end="00:50:58.850" style="s2">so yeah it can be done by a computer to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.090" end="00:51:03.500" style="s2">actually link everything and show it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.850" end="00:51:06.950" style="s2">the most matching document to what you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.500" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">want to see is this and then further the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.950" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">most matching documents to the document</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:17.980" style="s2">you just saw is this and this and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:26.180" style="s2">explanation like going on a fractal tree</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.980" end="00:51:27.860" style="s2">that would be yeah yeah I just wanted we</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.180" end="00:51:30.560" style="s2">only have about less than five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.860" end="00:51:32.270" style="s2">left and so how we end this is we go</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.560" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">around and each person can say what they</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.270" end="00:51:37.400" style="s2">think is the solution we count by third</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:39.080" style="s2">you can comprehend a little bit that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.400" end="00:51:43.190" style="s2">think is the most powerful you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.080" end="00:51:44.420" style="s2">would be the most impactful or solving</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.190" end="00:51:50.780" style="s2">what we are trying to solve which today</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.420" end="00:51:55.550" style="s2">is mapping gave me I guess for me it</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.780" end="00:51:58.940" style="s2">would be just creating that kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.550" end="00:52:00.530" style="s2">most basic kind of mapping tool that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.940" end="00:52:02.380" style="s2">it&#39;s got the most basic features</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.530" end="00:52:04.190" style="s2">required but it&#39;s enough to enable</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.380" end="00:52:07.580" style="s2">mapping of all different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.190" end="00:52:09.320" style="s2">subjects and doing it collaboratively it</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.580" end="00:52:10.790" style="s2">sounds like a very complicated thing but</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.320" end="00:52:13.250" style="s2">I actually think you could reduce it</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.790" end="00:52:15.380" style="s2">down to a pretty simple set of rules and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.250" end="00:52:18.740" style="s2">dynamics it just needs to be really well</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.380" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">thought through and have a nice UI to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.740" end="00:52:23.240" style="s2">kind of match with that but I think if</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:24.950" style="s2">we were able to do that in a very basic</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.240" end="00:52:27.530" style="s2">level which I just think it could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.950" end="00:52:29.840" style="s2">applied in all these different areas and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.530" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">different scales as well so I think if</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.840" end="00:52:34.670" style="s2">we could nail that initial design I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:37.130" style="s2">think that&#39;s it could grow into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.670" end="00:52:42.580" style="s2">of an unlimited tree of other different</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.130" end="00:52:45.500" style="s2">things yeah I totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.580" end="00:52:49.340" style="s2">starting small something very simple</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.500" end="00:52:53.390" style="s2">because yeah most important thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.340" end="00:52:57.980" style="s2">just start even if it was a system with</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.390" end="00:53:00.290" style="s2">one text box with enabling people to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.980" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">write it down stuff and then connected</p>

<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:09.710" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a start and that would be where</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.480" end="00:53:12.500" style="s2">data starts being gathered and then it</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.710" end="00:53:13.940" style="s2">can be always improved instead of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.500" end="00:53:19.130" style="s2">designing a perfect system from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.940" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t start actually I really like</p>

<p begin="00:53:42.560" end="00:53:49.100" style="s2">ideas as well as djibouti by the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.700" end="00:53:51.940" style="s2">this is what I wanted to show you on our</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.100" end="00:53:56.540" style="s2">last meeting which didn&#39;t work because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.940" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">couldn&#39;t screen sure about yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.540" end="00:54:04.970" style="s2">something and yeah it&#39;s tough it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:07.580" style="s2">long time ago me wanting to do some</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.970" end="00:54:09.950" style="s2">something that I no longer want to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.580" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">but still I have this idea in my head</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.950" end="00:54:17.630" style="s2">that it needs to be expressed sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">there are ideas that yeah I heard this</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.630" end="00:54:22.430" style="s2">so I do take up time with this but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">heard something like there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.430" end="00:54:29.950" style="s2">ideas that want to express themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.650" end="00:54:34.190" style="s2">and they use humans as a vehicle of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.950" end="00:54:37.330" style="s2">enacting this this idea so that&#39;s I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.190" end="00:54:40.280" style="s2">it stuck in my head and I just need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.330" end="00:54:46.790" style="s2">finish it and I am totally definitely</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.280" end="00:54:49.960" style="s2">happy to use that as some kind of but to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.790" end="00:54:53.270" style="s2">show it more to work on this and to be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.960" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">foundation of some useful tool at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.270" end="00:55:02.720" style="s2">that would be perfect because as much as</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:06.260" style="s2">I in the last few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.720" end="00:55:09.550" style="s2">I watched most of the tools out there</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.260" end="00:55:13.880" style="s2">the mapping tools including the brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.550" end="00:55:21.670" style="s2">the seven vortex thing is also very cool</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.880" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">then it&#39;s beautiful but each of them is</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.670" end="00:55:30.490" style="s2">I didn&#39;t think any of them that this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:33.860" style="s2">the perfect thing and all of them are</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.490" end="00:55:38.900" style="s2">missing like some part of some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.860" end="00:55:42.170" style="s2">and obviously the least we can do like</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.900" end="00:55:48.410" style="s2">the the noticed thing to do is to make a</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.170" end="00:55:49.730" style="s2">tool that does it all yeah I love it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.410" end="00:55:51.590" style="s2">I was I was writing down mind you gave</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.730" end="00:55:52.730" style="s2">me a piece of it so I think although I</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.590" end="00:55:54.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t really talk about it turn our</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.730" end="00:55:56.360" style="s2">solutions one of its one of the tools</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.680" end="00:55:58.910" style="s2">that in common would help with all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.360" end="00:56:00.470" style="s2">the solutions as well it&#39;s like feeding</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.910" end="00:56:02.300" style="s2">ourselves and getting that stuff ready</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.470" end="00:56:05.930" style="s2">so we have more sovereignty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.300" end="00:56:07.700" style="s2">harder to do having a like a Yelp of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.930" end="00:56:09.110" style="s2">apps that we own together that we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.700" end="00:56:10.820" style="s2">trust when someone works for a tool and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.110" end="00:56:12.650" style="s2">it&#39;s available that you know it exists</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.820" end="00:56:15.260" style="s2">but what I love that you gave me is like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.650" end="00:56:16.790" style="s2">part of knowing what one feature has</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.260" end="00:56:18.350" style="s2">another feature has that was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.790" end="00:56:19.730" style="s2">know which one to use right of all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.350" end="00:56:21.860" style="s2">team-building ones which one&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.730" end="00:56:23.510" style="s2">but she able to actually say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.860" end="00:56:24.890" style="s2">missing why don&#39;t I use this one because</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.510" end="00:56:26.570" style="s2">then we can kind of create one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.890" end="00:56:29.480" style="s2">the best of all worlds right like what</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.570" end="00:56:30.920" style="s2">is Facebook missing a lot but like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.480" end="00:56:32.780" style="s2">you actually articulate it right that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.920" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">the other ones have and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.780" end="00:56:35.840" style="s2">see when Nick creates something when</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:38.270" style="s2">Matus crates anyone crates on the inner</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.840" end="00:56:39.590" style="s2">out of game be that it&#39;s then able to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.270" end="00:56:42.230" style="s2">available to the world in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.590" end="00:56:44.360" style="s2">goes around Facebook and Google right</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.230" end="00:56:46.220" style="s2">that&#39;s like hey we know it exists is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.360" end="00:56:48.020" style="s2">trustworthy doesn&#39;t work and then how</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.220" end="00:56:50.300" style="s2">can we improve it even if whether we own</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.020" end="00:56:53.000" style="s2">it together or somebody else owns it how</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.300" end="00:56:54.620" style="s2">can we actually continually improve this</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.000" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">so we can trust it more so it gets to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.620" end="00:56:57.740" style="s2">the best of both worlds right it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:00.140" style="s2">have all the features that we would need</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.740" end="00:57:02.150" style="s2">it to have and at a price point we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.140" end="00:57:04.130" style="s2">afford which hopefully a zero but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.150" end="00:57:05.690" style="s2">know anyway the app can sustain itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.130" end="00:57:07.730" style="s2">the people can sustain itself but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.690" end="00:57:09.710" style="s2">people using it have as little input as</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.730" end="00:57:10.760" style="s2">possible because it&#39;s antivirus and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.710" end="00:57:12.890" style="s2">more they&#39;re involved in it the better</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.760" end="00:57:14.180" style="s2">benefit there is for everyone but we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.890" end="00:57:16.820" style="s2">definitely at the our mark does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.180" end="00:57:21.050" style="s2">have any closing statements before go</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.820" end="00:57:24.130" style="s2">jump on the discord called all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.050" end="00:57:24.130" style="s2">thank you James I Matus</p>
