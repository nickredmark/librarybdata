<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">two levels one is a superficial level</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.120" style="s2">well we it&#39;s the only way we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">survive in the future in our</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">actually going to experientially</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">understand how we can live with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:15.090" style="s2">earth or what this earth really is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">can&#39;t experience it once with summer</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.090" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">sitting in a jet plane or a Mercedes</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">Benz but we can experience it when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:24.660" style="s2">living in Iran hot made out of straw</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:27.060" style="s2">bale all-natural materials is your</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:29.790" style="s2">vision of the future one where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.060" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">really going back to just natural</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.790" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">materials and a set of future primitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">lifestyle or do you do you see a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">that we might be able to bring what was</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">good about these traditional cultures</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:48.630" style="s2">back into a modern technological culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">and and somehow marry the two I think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.630" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">can neither - it depends how many people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:55.560" style="s2">you need to have Oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">but speaking ideally yes I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">marry the two but I think it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">much more organic relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:07.560" style="s2">nature we may have a high tech we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">probably have computers but we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.560" end="00:03:11.459" style="s2">using those computers in buildings that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:13.829" style="s2">have made largely out of natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.459" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">materials that buildings that when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.829" end="00:03:18.269" style="s2">sit in them are constantly reminding us</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">of the Earth from which the materials</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.269" end="00:03:24.120" style="s2">were taken that doesn&#39;t mean to say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">we can&#39;t have a sophisticated buildings</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.120" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">I mean I think many of the buildings</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">even of the Victorian age embodied that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:31.890" style="s2">sort of organic feeling I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll be sitting in glass-fronted</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.890" end="00:03:36.750" style="s2">skyscrapers in that in that time I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">there might still be some left that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.750" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">have to use ideally I think they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.570" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">moved away from that kind of a intense</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:46.579" style="s2">hi-tech at least an hour an hour</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:46.579" style="s2">buildings</p>
