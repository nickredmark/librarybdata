<p begin="00:00:00.800" end="00:00:07.049" style="s2">why we what we are gonna create it</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:10.469" style="s2">together is better than the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.049" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">iteration of open source so open source</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.469" end="00:00:17.220" style="s2">is amazing it needs to continue and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:21.140" style="s2">need to find ways to make it viable more</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">viable it is but like improve upon it</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.140" end="00:00:26.330" style="s2">open source to me is there are issues</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.330" end="00:00:29.550" style="s2">expecially it won&#39;t especially the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">technology space the only place that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.550" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">exists is that in order to use it to its</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">full capacity you need to be a tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">person so there&#39;s like this two-tiered</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">system where if you understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">technology can basically hack then you</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">get to use these open-source tools to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">the best of the capacity and not pay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:55.469" style="s2">like you get them for free or next to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">free whereas the less tech you have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.469" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">more you have to pay to access these</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:03.180" style="s2">tools and the less good they are because</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:04.650" style="s2">you can&#39;t code them right like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.180" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">improve upon them yourself and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.650" end="00:01:09.510" style="s2">no way to improve upon them and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:10.830" style="s2">no way to kind of find if it does I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.510" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know it exists and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.830" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist therefore it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">marketing piece is broken on that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">to be able to say what&#39;s not working and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">what iterations we want to go back into</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">the current one to say right that what</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">an amazing feature from this one an</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:29.220" style="s2">amazing feature from this one but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">not a tech person and I can&#39;t put them</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.220" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">together even though the sort the code</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">is available to me so the transparency</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">piece of open source means almost all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">our project I am sure or we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">vote to the open source unless there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">reason we look at and we decide that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">not a reason for this project right</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">there isn&#39;t enough good there we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">make it open source just to make it open</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">source but open source is powerful so of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">course you want it there&#39;s subpar</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">projects in open source like Mozilla is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">open source and I used it I always</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">downloaded it until I found out that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">Mozilla people the employees working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">Mozilla use Chrome because it&#39;s faster</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.330" style="s2">and that was a decade ago so it might</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:17.800" style="s2">might have changed</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:19.870" style="s2">by now but although people can make it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.800" end="00:02:21.550" style="s2">better the whole thing isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.870" end="00:02:23.650" style="s2">made better by the people making it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.550" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">better they&#39;re kind of dissipating that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.650" end="00:02:28.450" style="s2">energy instead of bringing it back into</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">one instead of saying okay well can we</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">use just this tool in this tool this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:37.330" style="s2">tool yes I want those so give me that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:40.240" style="s2">you know if we can make the open source</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.330" end="00:02:43.060" style="s2">code be like Lego blocks where I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.240" end="00:02:44.350" style="s2">choose or all of the Lego blocks are</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.060" end="00:02:46.330" style="s2">available this really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.350" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">structure but I only get to see what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.330" end="00:02:51.310" style="s2">can see so that it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:54.520" style="s2">simple for me we can create in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.310" end="00:02:55.900" style="s2">that it starts out subpar and not able</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.520" end="00:02:57.820" style="s2">to compete in the marketplace but</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.900" end="00:03:00.850" style="s2">because our energy of making it better</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.820" end="00:03:02.770" style="s2">is going back into the whole it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.850" end="00:03:04.810" style="s2">much better than what&#39;s currently in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.770" end="00:03:07.930" style="s2">marketplace done in secret in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.810" end="00:03:09.910" style="s2">that what we are creating together is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.930" end="00:03:12.490" style="s2">more powerful than open source how it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.910" end="00:03:14.320" style="s2">currently is because we and if it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.490" end="00:03:17.769" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to compete them let alone</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.320" end="00:03:20.110" style="s2">the you know Facebook and Google we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.769" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">to find because it&#39;s like the system of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.110" end="00:03:24.010" style="s2">creation and what we are creating that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:25.690" style="s2">different it happens to be technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.010" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">but we&#39;re not actually a technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.690" end="00:03:29.980" style="s2">company and that&#39;s gonna be its own</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">video but this was a bit of why although</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.980" end="00:03:36.610" style="s2">we will use open-source we aren&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">open-source there&#39;s something else here</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.610" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">that open-source doesn&#39;t offer</p>
