<p begin="00:00:11.170" end="00:00:16.240" style="s2">let me ask you a couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.030" end="00:00:17.770" style="s2">have occurred to me in terms of not what</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.240" end="00:00:20.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about but you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.770" end="00:00:23.380" style="s2">like the ground rules if you like for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.200" end="00:00:26.079" style="s2">want of a better word you know things</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.380" end="00:00:27.460" style="s2">like for example I mean what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.079" end="00:00:29.079" style="s2">really have a sort of clear picture in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.460" end="00:00:30.610" style="s2">my mind which is maybe no bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.079" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">given what it is we&#39;re attempting to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.610" end="00:00:33.579" style="s2">here right not to have to clear up in</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:38.260" style="s2">the mind all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.579" end="00:00:40.840" style="s2">that may be part of the problem right I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.260" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">mean did you see a sort of picking a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.840" end="00:00:45.160" style="s2">topic or a problem or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:48.370" style="s2">centering a discussion around there or</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.160" end="00:00:50.200" style="s2">just kind of talking to each other about</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.370" end="00:00:51.970" style="s2">some of the I&#39;d and see where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.200" end="00:00:55.480" style="s2">kind of things see what it evolves into</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.970" end="00:00:57.310" style="s2">or what do you have in mind I think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.480" end="00:00:59.380" style="s2">kind of at least at first for this one</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.310" end="00:01:02.320" style="s2">just sort of had in mind like you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.380" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">sort of just what jumped out at you you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:06.939" style="s2">know and like what are were some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:10.509" style="s2">concepts what do they relate to you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.939" end="00:01:13.990" style="s2">in your experience up to this point and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.509" end="00:01:16.150" style="s2">just kind of have that I just gather its</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.990" end="00:01:19.630" style="s2">own you know energy or whatever and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.150" end="00:01:22.210" style="s2">if we want to later on you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.630" end="00:01:24.190" style="s2">pick out specific topics and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.210" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">try and apply it well I mean the way I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.190" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">see it we&#39;re complete noobs at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:30.310" style="s2">right so I mean we&#39;re seeing out what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:31.810" style="s2">this whole thing of coherence is all</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.310" end="00:01:34.180" style="s2">about you know what I mean I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.810" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know what personal experiences you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.180" end="00:01:38.350" style="s2">may or may not have had of dropping into</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:41.830" style="s2">coherence with people in the past I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.350" end="00:01:44.020" style="s2">not sure I&#39;ve really got any benchmarks</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.830" end="00:01:45.939" style="s2">at all in terms of my own experience not</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.020" end="00:01:48.909" style="s2">of really having consciously</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.939" end="00:01:50.770" style="s2">deliberately achieved you know any any</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.909" end="00:01:53.799" style="s2">kind of coherence in a group so you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.770" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m a complete virgin really and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.799" end="00:01:59.590" style="s2">for for me at least this is about</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:02.200" style="s2">feeling out what it is what you know guy</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.590" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">just just to get some sense of it really</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.200" end="00:02:06.820" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:08.470" style="s2">yeah and I mean you know this would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.820" end="00:02:10.659" style="s2">where Matt would probably be a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.470" end="00:02:11.980" style="s2">good input because I mean that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.659" end="00:02:14.200" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s essentially what he does</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">up there you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.200" end="00:02:20.040" style="s2">besides being you know the teacher that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:22.510" style="s2">he is so he has sort of a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.040" end="00:02:24.489" style="s2">system there with him being the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.510" end="00:02:24.790" style="s2">but they also do a whole out of what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.489" end="00:02:27.459" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.790" end="00:02:29.439" style="s2">all inquiry you know which I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.459" end="00:02:31.629" style="s2">if you&#39;ve listened you watched any of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.439" end="00:02:36.819" style="s2">the you know they have the video from</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.629" end="00:02:38.769" style="s2">the summit public consumption I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.819" end="00:02:40.299" style="s2">watched the members fully fully expect I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.769" end="00:02:41.590" style="s2">have access to the members area I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.299" end="00:02:43.030" style="s2">haven&#39;t watched a full on I&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.590" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">watched the whatever it was an hour and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.030" end="00:02:48.459" style="s2">eight minutes one so one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:52.450" style="s2">the facilitator guys in that video</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.459" end="00:02:54.849" style="s2">talked about our inquiry and I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.450" end="00:02:56.620" style="s2">know I think that is I mean I have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.849" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">fair amount of experience with just kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.620" end="00:03:02.349" style="s2">of being in that space and so I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:05.829" style="s2">me a lot of what coherent seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.349" end="00:03:08.139" style="s2">about is about being able to embody that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.829" end="00:03:11.799" style="s2">kind of space where you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.139" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">you&#39;re not coming at it with your you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.799" end="00:03:15.939" style="s2">know your baggage or your fullness that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:17.079" style="s2">they talked about in that video isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.939" end="00:03:20.859" style="s2">yeah coming from it from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.079" end="00:03:23.500" style="s2">fullness not a place of need yes yes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.859" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">so that also goes to this whole anti</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.500" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">rival risks you know concept that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:29.979" style="s2">talked about a lot where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:33.819" style="s2">really in a you know we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.979" end="00:03:36.790" style="s2">come to any of these discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.819" end="00:03:42.370" style="s2">with rivalry strategies you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.790" end="00:03:44.229" style="s2">whatever yeah yeah sure and really like</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.370" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole idea is that if we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.229" end="00:03:51.129" style="s2">hold that space and embody that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:53.319" style="s2">dynamic together then you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.129" end="00:03:55.780" style="s2">really the only way anything you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.319" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">interesting or creative is gonna emerge</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.780" end="00:03:59.819" style="s2">because otherwise we&#39;re just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:01.959" style="s2">holding it down and playing game a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.819" end="00:04:03.639" style="s2">essentially yeah I mean that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.959" end="00:04:07.510" style="s2">the things that Jordan mentioned wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.639" end="00:04:09.340" style="s2">it is the danger of thinking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.510" end="00:04:10.989" style="s2">playing game B whereas actually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.340" end="00:04:14.919" style="s2">just playing another version of game a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.989" end="00:04:16.659" style="s2">right right let me see there&#39;s now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.919" end="00:04:19.329" style="s2">gonna get my notes out here there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.659" end="00:04:21.099" style="s2">something in there that I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.329" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">and again we can just sort of take this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.099" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">and run with it at this point cuz I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:27.220" style="s2">you know if Mac is able to join us</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">that&#39;s great otherwise you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.220" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">always just crack on it&#39;s a that comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.090" style="s2">along and if Ben comes along and great</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:35.349" style="s2">but they&#39;re already what they&#39;re six</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:36.879" style="s2">minutes late I don&#39;t think we should be</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.349" end="00:04:40.059" style="s2">holding our breath for them</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.879" end="00:04:43.539" style="s2">right so let&#39;s see so at some point</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.059" end="00:04:49.929" style="s2">they&#39;re talking and Jordan has this riff</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.539" end="00:04:52.089" style="s2">about let&#39;s see the least okay so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.929" end="00:04:54.219" style="s2">talking about urgency and responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.089" end="00:04:58.449" style="s2">and he&#39;s talking about how to properly</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.219" end="00:05:00.849" style="s2">respond to urgent C and it there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.449" end="00:05:03.099" style="s2">theme that goes back a little bit in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.849" end="00:05:07.959" style="s2">conversation about having patience and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.099" end="00:05:12.369" style="s2">humility right and so he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.959" end="00:05:15.339" style="s2">how like he gives the analogy of James</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.369" end="00:05:17.379" style="s2">Bond you know when he&#39;s like the stakes</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.339" end="00:05:19.869" style="s2">are high and the urgency is super high</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.379" end="00:05:22.449" style="s2">but he can&#39;t you know give any of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.869" end="00:05:25.149" style="s2">off or else it&#39;ll ruin the whole you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.449" end="00:05:26.349" style="s2">know plan so the idea he said that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.149" end="00:05:28.779" style="s2">really jumped out at me was something</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.349" end="00:05:31.599" style="s2">like the least bit of feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.779" end="00:05:32.319" style="s2">urgency right so you&#39;re aware of it you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.599" end="00:05:33.669" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.319" end="00:05:35.619" style="s2">the ambience I&#39;m getting quote you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.669" end="00:05:37.419" style="s2">not getting nervous from it or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.619" end="00:05:39.189" style="s2">you&#39;re not getting right yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.419" end="00:05:41.469" style="s2">getting tightened up from it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.189" end="00:05:43.899" style="s2">that&#39;s right and so what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.469" end="00:05:45.909" style="s2">you get caught in that right is that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.899" end="00:05:47.589" style="s2">know guarantees failure by suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.909" end="00:05:50.139" style="s2">one of two strategies that you either</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.589" end="00:05:52.990" style="s2">move into something that&#39;s not yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.139" end="00:05:55.749" style="s2">possible in coherence so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.990" end="00:05:59.079" style="s2">like you know trying to move too fast</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.749" end="00:06:01.180" style="s2">right into something that you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.079" end="00:06:03.579" style="s2">maybe just between the two of us like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.180" end="00:06:06.249" style="s2">that would be an example of like me</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.579" end="00:06:08.889" style="s2">trying to push forward with a different</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.249" end="00:06:12.219" style="s2">set of definitions say than what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.889" end="00:06:15.099" style="s2">have right we must do something this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.219" end="00:06:16.659" style="s2">something therefore we must do it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.099" end="00:06:18.339" style="s2">right well even though we haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.659" end="00:06:20.679" style="s2">let&#39;s say establish basic ground rules</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.339" end="00:06:22.929" style="s2">or you know we&#39;re operating on two</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.679" end="00:06:24.999" style="s2">different definitions you know something</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.929" end="00:06:26.379" style="s2">well yeah and actually that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.999" end="00:06:27.639" style="s2">else that I was thinking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.379" end="00:06:29.169" style="s2">round so this was exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.639" end="00:06:30.939" style="s2">definitions I mean we&#39;re likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.169" end="00:06:34.659" style="s2">into conversations where we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.939" end="00:06:36.309" style="s2">terms which holds different meanings for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.659" end="00:06:38.829" style="s2">different people right and so the need</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.309" end="00:06:40.509" style="s2">to define those terms during the course</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.829" end="00:06:41.649" style="s2">of the conversation as they come up you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.509" end="00:06:43.990" style="s2">know what I mean I mean we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.649" end="00:06:45.579" style="s2">ready any individual needs to be ready</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.990" end="00:06:47.499" style="s2">to say okay hang on what exactly do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.579" end="00:06:48.939" style="s2">mean by that you know because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.499" end="00:06:50.889" style="s2">lot of words like that especially when</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.939" end="00:06:53.050" style="s2">you enter into mythology really</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.889" end="00:06:55.030" style="s2">politics ideology you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.050" end="00:06:56.409" style="s2">you know people have completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.030" end="00:06:58.569" style="s2">different meanings it&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.409" end="00:07:00.729" style="s2">different baggage that they bring to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.569" end="00:07:03.159" style="s2">these terms you know this really needs</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.729" end="00:07:04.749" style="s2">to be ironed out right yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.159" end="00:07:07.509" style="s2">I mean especially like you said when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.749" end="00:07:09.939" style="s2">get into you know really complex topics</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.509" end="00:07:13.419" style="s2">and metaphysics and you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.939" end="00:07:15.189" style="s2">else I mean and even in even in things</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.419" end="00:07:16.749" style="s2">that are more concrete like say</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.189" end="00:07:18.789" style="s2">government or something I mean you still</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.749" end="00:07:20.110" style="s2">need to have a common set of terms that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.789" end="00:07:21.580" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna use and you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.110" end="00:07:23.560" style="s2">sure that&#39;s established so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.580" end="00:07:26.860" style="s2">something like trying to push forward</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.560" end="00:07:29.979" style="s2">too quickly into something that you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.860" end="00:07:32.199" style="s2">is not gonna operate with incoherence</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.979" end="00:07:33.789" style="s2">and then you could also the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.199" end="00:07:36.550" style="s2">that you know the second danger you run</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.789" end="00:07:39.370" style="s2">into when you get caught up in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.550" end="00:07:41.669" style="s2">feeling of the urgency is you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.370" end="00:07:45.009" style="s2">try it you might try and rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.669" end="00:07:46.360" style="s2">pulling from the game a toolkit which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.009" end="00:07:49.659" style="s2">like what I think you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.360" end="00:07:52.029" style="s2">earlier about you know playing game a or</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.659" end="00:07:55.150" style="s2">utilizing game a strategies without even</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.029" end="00:07:56.770" style="s2">really realizing it yeah well I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.150" end="00:07:58.210" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be you know with the best</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.770" end="00:08:00.370" style="s2">will in the world and I mean Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.210" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">Jordan and Daniel have got to be further</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.370" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">along the road than most on this right</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:06.219" style="s2">he&#39;s the first to admit that thousands</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.779" style="s2">and thousands of times you know that he</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.219" end="00:08:11.259" style="s2">has fucked up one way or another you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.779" end="00:08:13.149" style="s2">know so as the expectation needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.259" end="00:08:15.449" style="s2">that that we&#39;re gonna fuck up a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.149" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">know what I mean and therefore watch</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.449" end="00:08:19.930" style="s2">yeah and and that it&#39;s hard especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.460" style="s2">coming from you know this is another</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.930" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">thing is what we&#39;re running game a code</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.460" end="00:08:26.169" style="s2">right we&#39;ve always run game a code and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">not run game a code is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.169" end="00:08:29.259" style="s2">difficult even when you have this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:31.810" style="s2">what Jamie was talking about right even</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.259" end="00:08:34.060" style="s2">when people have at the boom fest or</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.810" end="00:08:35.890" style="s2">with the mushrooms among their friends</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.060" end="00:08:39.690" style="s2">when they have that experience they drop</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.890" end="00:08:42.789" style="s2">into coherence they drop into flow they</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.690" end="00:08:45.430" style="s2">conceptualize it using game a code right</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.789" end="00:08:47.260" style="s2">and and then so straightaway becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.430" end="00:08:49.329" style="s2">part of game a it&#39;s not Gabey it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.260" end="00:08:50.949" style="s2">straightaway part of game eight and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.329" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">incredibly hard not to do that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.949" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know how we go about not doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.050" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna have to be constantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:57.339" style="s2">checking up on both ourselves and each</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.050" end="00:08:59.890" style="s2">other that we&#39;re not doing that right</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.339" end="00:09:02.769" style="s2">right which there goes back to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.890" end="00:09:04.520" style="s2">other point that I was really honing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.769" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">on which is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.520" end="00:09:10.010" style="s2">so Jordan has another riff about like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:15.150" style="s2">call it something like authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.010" end="00:09:17.370" style="s2">detection yeah right and so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.150" end="00:09:19.860" style="s2">end and we all do this like you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.370" end="00:09:22.740" style="s2">you know you can sniff out somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.860" end="00:09:24.840" style="s2">who&#39;s not really you know trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.740" end="00:09:33.870" style="s2">something out authentically or you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.840" end="00:09:37.080" style="s2">or just operating from a script yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.870" end="00:09:39.990" style="s2">then you you know you you have to be you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:43.020" style="s2">have to be willing to call bullshit on</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.990" end="00:09:44.970" style="s2">somebody else right they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">willing to accept that yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">you&#39;re right sorry man you&#39;re right I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">was doing that yeah that&#39;s the thing so</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:53.520" style="s2">you have to be willing to bullshit but</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.960" style="s2">you also have to be willing to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.520" end="00:09:58.380" style="s2">somebody else call bullshit on you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.960" end="00:10:04.260" style="s2">absolutely right and that&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.380" end="00:10:07.740" style="s2">either I think I said that to you in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.260" end="00:10:10.380" style="s2">message didn&#39;t either the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.740" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">play game be when we are so entrenched</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.380" end="00:10:15.030" style="s2">in game a I think I think is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">lofty one maybe a slightly unrealistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.030" end="00:10:19.830" style="s2">one but then it&#39;s yeah what choice do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:23.400" style="s2">have other toilets do we have yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.830" end="00:10:26.250" style="s2">exactly you know and so that I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.400" end="00:10:28.620" style="s2">kind of you know gravitate toward</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.250" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">Jamie&#39;s perspective because to me the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.620" end="00:10:36.020" style="s2">biggest concern is like okay how are we</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:41.070" style="s2">to operate within game B parameters</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.020" end="00:10:43.620" style="s2">while still being able to operate in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.070" end="00:10:49.140" style="s2">game a because I mean like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:53.010" style="s2">have to correct it and actually game B</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.140" end="00:10:54.960" style="s2">is really I mean I don&#39;t know maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.010" end="00:10:59.100" style="s2">disagree with this but game being sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.960" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">of super to game a but game a strategies</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.100" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">would still be employed to implement</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.260" end="00:11:05.430" style="s2">those things which came out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:08.370" style="s2">playing of game B right I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.430" end="00:11:10.260" style="s2">still nitty-gritty administrative boring</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.370" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">mechanical stuff that needs doing at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.260" end="00:11:15.150" style="s2">other end right and that&#39;s game a I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:17.540" style="s2">would think that that doesn&#39;t entirely</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.150" end="00:11:20.850" style="s2">go away</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.540" end="00:11:22.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s kind of like light and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.850" end="00:11:24.150" style="s2">what we you know why would the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.440" end="00:11:27.690" style="s2">language that I would use is like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.150" end="00:11:31.170" style="s2">holding this space open and you know to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.690" end="00:11:34.650" style="s2">use sager gifs terminology it would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.170" end="00:11:37.110" style="s2">something like the space between yes and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.650" end="00:11:39.450" style="s2">no so you&#39;re like so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.110" end="00:11:41.820" style="s2">committed one way or the other yet</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.450" end="00:11:43.470" style="s2">because you&#39;re you&#39;re waiting you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.820" end="00:11:47.000" style="s2">you&#39;re being patient you&#39;re waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.470" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">something to arise in the space between</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.000" end="00:11:52.650" style="s2">right but at some point you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">have to collapse the wave form you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.650" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">what I mean and actually use something</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">so yes I would say saying again doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:01.830" style="s2">it whether that takes ten minutes or</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:03.720" style="s2">whether that takes ten months doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.830" end="00:12:05.220" style="s2">really matter the the you know when it</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.720" end="00:12:07.020" style="s2">happens it happens and everyone will</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.220" end="00:12:09.260" style="s2">recognize the fact that it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.020" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">right I mean the little</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.260" end="00:12:14.550" style="s2">there&#39;d be some kind of resonance that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:16.440" style="s2">runs through everyone in everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.550" end="00:12:18.150" style="s2">involved at the same time ha ha ha ha</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.440" end="00:12:19.500" style="s2">hang on we&#39;re onto something here right</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.150" end="00:12:21.480" style="s2">and everyone will feel that because</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:22.740" style="s2">they&#39;ve all been contributing up until</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.480" end="00:12:24.900" style="s2">that point right they&#39;ve all been</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.740" end="00:12:27.230" style="s2">holding whatever parts of it up until</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.900" end="00:12:30.029" style="s2">that point and then when it all</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.230" end="00:12:32.730" style="s2">crystallizes together into in turn into</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.029" end="00:12:34.770" style="s2">that thing into the third that that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.730" end="00:12:37.070" style="s2">mean I again I&#39;m talking from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.770" end="00:12:39.330" style="s2">no experience but I suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.070" end="00:12:42.330" style="s2">recognition will occur at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.330" end="00:12:44.339" style="s2">right well I think that&#39;s what the I</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.330" end="00:12:48.180" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what in a lot of ways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.339" end="00:12:50.570" style="s2">what rule Omega is about is is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.180" end="00:12:53.730" style="s2">coherence is about the recognition right</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.570" end="00:12:56.130" style="s2">all right I mean so the more the more we</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.730" end="00:12:57.720" style="s2">communicate and the more we leave the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.130" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">space open and like you said no matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.720" end="00:13:02.070" style="s2">how long it takes and all along the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:03.510" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be little moments of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.070" end="00:13:05.459" style="s2">recognition and stuff but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.510" end="00:13:08.339" style="s2">basically the process of building</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.459" end="00:13:13.670" style="s2">coherence at least that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.339" end="00:13:15.990" style="s2">seems to me ya know it&#39;s a partly</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.670" end="00:13:18.390" style="s2">intellectual or cognitive thing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.990" end="00:13:21.860" style="s2">also largely intuitive right you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.390" end="00:13:24.779" style="s2">you gotta let go of the linear logical</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.860" end="00:13:29.089" style="s2">thought process to a certain degree and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.779" end="00:13:31.230" style="s2">allow the more mysterious things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.089" end="00:13:33.330" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.230" end="00:13:36.690" style="s2">yeah and you know like in the very</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.330" end="00:13:40.770" style="s2">beginning there was a nice you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.690" end="00:13:43.890" style="s2">summary of kind of what game a is and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.770" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">has been and a lot of that is totally</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.890" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">related to denotative language right</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:51.300" style="s2">does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:53.720" style="s2">yeah well he called semantic language</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.300" end="00:13:56.490" style="s2">rather than correct language yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.720" end="00:13:57.090" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like if you can put it into</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.490" end="00:13:58.050" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.090" end="00:14:01.110" style="s2">you know it&#39;s sort of like the Dow or</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.050" end="00:14:05.390" style="s2">something right like the Dow that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.110" end="00:14:05.390" style="s2">can point to you is not the Dow or what</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.570" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">every much I&#39;m on board with that idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:13.890" style="s2">but equally you can I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:18.810" style="s2">idea of using language as a thing not to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.890" end="00:14:21.300" style="s2">describe a thing but to awaken in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.810" end="00:14:23.430" style="s2">person hearing the words pointing them</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.300" end="00:14:25.620" style="s2">to an experience in themselves which</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.430" end="00:14:28.350" style="s2">they can recognize yeah that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.620" end="00:14:30.690" style="s2">language that it&#39;s not yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.350" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">describing a thing but now I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.690" end="00:14:36.350" style="s2">thing we have to be the piece of art the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:38.550" style="s2">same feeling that the artists themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.350" end="00:14:40.050" style="s2">held in their hearts when they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.550" end="00:14:42.330" style="s2">creating the piece of art you know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.050" end="00:14:44.610" style="s2">I mean and so it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.330" end="00:14:46.170" style="s2">communicating and so yeah that&#39;s so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.610" end="00:14:48.120" style="s2">forgotten what exactly my point was but</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.170" end="00:14:51.030" style="s2">that&#39;s well I mean we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.120" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">you know remind ourselves constantly</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.030" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">that you know words or pointers I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:57.300" style="s2">like language is pointer it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:59.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing as like the Maps not</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.300" end="00:15:01.140" style="s2">the territory yeah yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.070" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s exactly like that I like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.140" end="00:15:06.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a great analogy yeah but you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:08.640" style="s2">saying about like so we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.060" end="00:15:13.560" style="s2">about the these peak experiences let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.640" end="00:15:16.650" style="s2">say and if we&#39;re working on coherence</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.560" end="00:15:18.810" style="s2">and we build up to a point where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.650" end="00:15:21.900" style="s2">reach you know a place of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.810" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">and something new or interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.900" end="00:15:28.260" style="s2">rises you know we also have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:31.260" style="s2">to kind of let that like at some point</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.260" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna have to unspool and unravel</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.260" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">because to me it just seems like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:35.760" style="s2">can&#39;t get around that like what we were</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.280" style="s2">talking about how at some point you got</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.760" end="00:15:40.140" style="s2">to go you know pay some bills can I just</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.280" end="00:15:41.670" style="s2">stop you just on just on a clarity thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.140" end="00:15:43.500" style="s2">so what do you mean by spool and unravel</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.670" end="00:15:44.260" style="s2">do you mean needs to be articulated then</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.500" end="00:15:46.810" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.260" end="00:15:49.210" style="s2">in actual you know semantics language or</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.810" end="00:15:51.790" style="s2">do you mean it falls apart no I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.210" end="00:15:54.460" style="s2">well it can oh I was meaning it can fall</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.790" end="00:15:56.080" style="s2">apart right and and you have to be kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.460" end="00:15:58.870" style="s2">of okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.080" end="00:16:02.500" style="s2">yeah I think Jamie said something in</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.870" end="00:16:07.450" style="s2">there about he was talking about having</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.500" end="00:16:10.090" style="s2">patience and like to me it sounded like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.450" end="00:16:13.660" style="s2">a lot like what happens when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.090" end="00:16:17.950" style="s2">on psychedelics right so it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:19.630" style="s2">sort of unravel the ego you know to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.950" end="00:16:21.970" style="s2">certain point and when you&#39;re like when</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.630" end="00:16:24.280" style="s2">you&#39;re in the peak I mean often times</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.970" end="00:16:28.030" style="s2">there&#39;s just no sense of self whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.280" end="00:16:31.870" style="s2">and then that&#39;s that then has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.030" end="00:16:33.310" style="s2">rebuilt through that experience and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like when we reach these</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.310" end="00:16:41.320" style="s2">points of coherence it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:43.930" style="s2">that the key is to maintain that but the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.320" end="00:16:48.460" style="s2">key is to be patient enough to allow it</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.930" end="00:16:50.740" style="s2">to unravel and take new forms right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.460" end="00:16:54.550" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that very articulately</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.740" end="00:16:55.990" style="s2">but it&#39;s a help to getting back there</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.550" end="00:16:57.550" style="s2">again once you&#39;ve been there and would</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.990" end="00:16:58.870" style="s2">you would you say that&#39;s the case that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.550" end="00:17:01.000" style="s2">the more you get there the easier it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.870" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">to get there or not I would well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.000" end="00:17:04.810" style="s2">know how I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:08.140" style="s2">expectations which block you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.810" end="00:17:09.970" style="s2">there again it could also be well it</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.140" end="00:17:14.320" style="s2">could but see that&#39;s a that&#39;s a game a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.970" end="00:17:16.330" style="s2">thing yeah right to think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.320" end="00:17:18.520" style="s2">always got to be the same way now you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.330" end="00:17:22.870" style="s2">know I would I would say that you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.520" end="00:17:25.000" style="s2">better at it I do think it&#39;s a skill you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.870" end="00:17:26.620" style="s2">know and I think they they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.000" end="00:17:28.390" style="s2">that in fact there&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.620" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">know going back to the thing about being</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.390" end="00:17:36.490" style="s2">able to you know call like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">not allowed to let people you know play</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.490" end="00:17:41.560" style="s2">game a hey I&#39;m unnecessarily kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:45.550" style="s2">right and so there&#39;s like skillful</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.560" end="00:17:49.990" style="s2">discernment yeah so it is a skill to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.550" end="00:17:52.870" style="s2">able to say and to do it with tact and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.990" end="00:17:55.690" style="s2">to do it in a way that&#39;s constructive to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.870" end="00:17:58.140" style="s2">say hey look you&#39;re in your bullshit you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.690" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">know you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.140" end="00:18:01.950" style="s2">connecting right now you&#39;re you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.870" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know find ways to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.950" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">around that I guess but I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.870" end="00:18:11.190" style="s2">another video that Jamie you know did</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.790" end="00:18:12.500" style="s2">something maybe it&#39;s scaling coherence</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.190" end="00:18:15.000" style="s2">or something but he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.500" end="00:18:18.300" style="s2">those meetings that he went to and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.000" end="00:18:20.700" style="s2">easily you know things got derailed by</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.300" end="00:18:22.410" style="s2">topics that just weren&#39;t even relative</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.700" end="00:18:24.630" style="s2">relevant to what they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.410" end="00:18:26.700" style="s2">solve you know and just all those old</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.630" end="00:18:28.950" style="s2">game a feelings come rushing up and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.700" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">whole thing falls apart yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.950" end="00:18:33.210" style="s2">so I mean to some extent you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:36.570" style="s2">willing to be patient but I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.210" end="00:18:38.460" style="s2">also I mean there&#39;s a point when I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:42.090" style="s2">I think you&#39;re not allowed to let</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.460" end="00:18:44.190" style="s2">somebody get away with it you know in</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.090" end="00:18:48.810" style="s2">certain environments necessary there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.190" end="00:18:52.350" style="s2">purity of intention and there&#39;s a purity</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.810" end="00:18:54.540" style="s2">of passing on Jeff Jordan talks about</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.350" end="00:18:58.530" style="s2">this in another video it parts passing</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.540" end="00:19:00.900" style="s2">on in a high-fidelity manner that which</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.530" end="00:19:03.810" style="s2">comes to you you know what I mean and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.900" end="00:19:05.700" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re bringing a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.810" end="00:19:09.660" style="s2">information from another source and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.700" end="00:19:10.890" style="s2">needs to be done not so I&#39;m gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.660" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">quite the right words here but as</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.890" end="00:19:14.250" style="s2">truthfully as possible you know not</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.960" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">leaving a little bit of it out because</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.250" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t fit with what you said before</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:19.190" style="s2">and therefore might not make you look</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:21.390" style="s2">good or whatever you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.190" end="00:19:23.700" style="s2">everything has to be passed on high</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.390" end="00:19:25.140" style="s2">fidelity screening out noise from</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.700" end="00:19:27.780" style="s2">signals you remember all of this noise</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.140" end="00:19:29.100" style="s2">from signal thing oh yeah and so does</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">this what you were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.100" end="00:19:34.860" style="s2">discernment of noise from signal not</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.860" end="00:19:40.830" style="s2">signals you know I mean that&#39;s crucially</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.190" end="00:19:42.660" style="s2">awesome right or even or even on you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.830" end="00:19:46.140" style="s2">know with without you know unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.660" end="00:19:48.860" style="s2">that&#39;s why we need each other yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.140" end="00:19:52.830" style="s2">yeah right because I don&#39;t know you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.860" end="00:19:55.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve all got our traumas and bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.830" end="00:19:57.330" style="s2">and we&#39;ve all got our stories that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.020" end="00:20:00.060" style="s2">tell ourselves you know and we really</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.330" end="00:20:05.400" style="s2">need others to point those things out or</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.060" end="00:20:06.780" style="s2">help us you know understand that we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.400" end="00:20:09.060" style="s2">to suspend them for a little oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.780" end="00:20:10.860" style="s2">yeah or at least we need to hold them</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.060" end="00:20:15.900" style="s2">lightly I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.860" end="00:20:18.370" style="s2">yeah you know and the so the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.900" end="00:20:23.470" style="s2">you da man now I&#39;ve lost what you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.370" end="00:20:26.770" style="s2">just saying we&#39;re talking about fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.470" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">and about reducing noise and creating</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.770" end="00:20:30.820" style="s2">more signals so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:33.100" style="s2">thing at the end there about you know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.820" end="00:20:34.660" style="s2">think he uses the word ideology but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.100" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">know it could be just as well you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.660" end="00:20:44.350" style="s2">worldview or paradigm that you know all</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:46.840" style="s2">all ideologies have some degree of noise</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.350" end="00:20:50.110" style="s2">and some degree of signal and by</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.840" end="00:20:53.140" style="s2">definition the paradigm or the worldview</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.110" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">is is a you know a condensed version of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.140" end="00:20:57.640" style="s2">reality like it just you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:21:01.210" style="s2">possibly get all of it you know in there</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.640" end="00:21:03.700" style="s2">and so there&#39;s bound to be noise and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.210" end="00:21:06.730" style="s2">bound to be signal and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.700" end="00:21:10.180" style="s2">the more we can sort of connect and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.730" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">cohere the more hopefully we can reduce</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.180" end="00:21:16.420" style="s2">the noise and increase the signal would</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:18.510" style="s2">you say what is noise in one situation</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.420" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">could be signal in a different situation</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.510" end="00:21:26.050" style="s2">yeah I I think that&#39;s probably true you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">know I look at worldviews and paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.050" end="00:21:33.060" style="s2">like I mean where we want to be is in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:35.860" style="s2">place where we can differentially apply</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.060" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">paradigms depending on the situation</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.860" end="00:21:42.460" style="s2">yeah you know because one map doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:47.530" style="s2">apply to every you know place you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.460" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">find yourself not necessarily because</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.530" end="00:21:51.610" style="s2">they&#39;re dictionary meaning but for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:54.100" style="s2">personally and this is my own thing but</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.610" end="00:21:56.020" style="s2">an ideology is something which you stick</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.100" end="00:21:57.370" style="s2">to even in the face of significant</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.020" end="00:22:00.100" style="s2">evidence to the contrary whereas a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.370" end="00:22:03.250" style="s2">paradigm is not necessarily thus right a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.100" end="00:22:04.630" style="s2">paradigm is a bit more in my mind anyway</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.250" end="00:22:06.100" style="s2">not everyone might have this meaning but</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.630" end="00:22:08.200" style="s2">in my mind a paradigm is a bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.100" end="00:22:09.490" style="s2">scientific concept in that in the face</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">of overwhelming evidence to the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.490" end="00:22:13.330" style="s2">you&#39;re happy to drop it whereas an</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:15.100" style="s2">ideology well but there&#39;s more of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:17.500" style="s2">emotional attachment ideal as you write</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.100" end="00:22:19.900" style="s2">right right yeah I mean I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.500" end="00:22:24.310" style="s2">accurate you know you could say a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.900" end="00:22:29.380" style="s2">paradigm can shift into an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.310" end="00:22:31.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not held lightly enough yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.380" end="00:22:33.070" style="s2">and that&#39;s it and then the static</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.330" end="00:22:34.330" style="s2">institutions grow up around it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.070" end="00:22:36.010" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s when you know a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.330" end="00:22:38.200" style="s2">paradigm has become an ideology when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.010" end="00:22:39.670" style="s2">have static institutions which despite</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.200" end="00:22:41.620" style="s2">the fact they no longer relevant no</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.670" end="00:22:44.460" style="s2">longer serve a useful function they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.620" end="00:22:47.680" style="s2">still there doing their thing right</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.460" end="00:22:49.750" style="s2">because they have you know they have an</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.680" end="00:22:51.160" style="s2">interest of their own yeah they had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.750" end="00:22:52.990" style="s2">use in the past they came into existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.160" end="00:22:55.120" style="s2">for a very good reason but that use is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.990" end="00:22:57.580" style="s2">no longer that you know that they use is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:58.810" style="s2">no longer really relevant but there they</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.580" end="00:22:59.950" style="s2">are there they are because their</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.810" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">institution oh yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.950" end="00:23:04.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s maybe not a bad way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.710" end="00:23:06.310" style="s2">differentiating between a paradigm in an</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.750" end="00:23:08.860" style="s2">ideology is does it have institutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.310" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">built up around it well yeah but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.860" end="00:23:12.700" style="s2">you could still hold you know something</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:15.790" style="s2">that you know somebody else might have</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.700" end="00:23:17.800" style="s2">as an ideology you know you could still</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.790" end="00:23:19.390" style="s2">employ that you know I don&#39;t know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.800" end="00:23:20.890" style="s2">that&#39;s tricky because there&#39;s this other</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.390" end="00:23:23.380" style="s2">argument I&#39;ve been having over there</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.890" end="00:23:27.420" style="s2">with our discussion with the guy Derek</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.380" end="00:23:30.940" style="s2">BG yeah yeah you know and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.420" end="00:23:33.370" style="s2">that&#39;s a tricky deal because you can you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.940" end="00:23:36.870" style="s2">can convince yourself that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.370" end="00:23:40.210" style="s2">really attached to the ideology and yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.870" end="00:23:42.010" style="s2">you know you can you really are I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.210" end="00:23:46.900" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole green performative</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.010" end="00:23:52.360" style="s2">contradiction is that you know to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.900" end="00:24:00.070" style="s2">that all all things are true or equally</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.360" end="00:24:02.560" style="s2">true and yet mine is the most true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.070" end="00:24:04.590" style="s2">sort of like like there is Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.560" end="00:24:07.810" style="s2">Peterson says right is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.590" end="00:24:09.160" style="s2">what you believe is not necessary to got</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.810" end="00:24:10.690" style="s2">anything to do with what you think of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.160" end="00:24:12.100" style="s2">what you say is what you do it&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.690" end="00:24:14.110" style="s2">live you know what I mean that this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.100" end="00:24:15.250" style="s2">the best this is the best indicator of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.110" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">what you actually believe and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.250" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a great deal of truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:19.960" style="s2">what was the other thing is the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:21.160" style="s2">thing you said Miranda knew something</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.960" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">anyway whatever doesn&#39;t matter that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.160" end="00:24:23.980" style="s2">the that was that was the important one</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:25.540" style="s2">and I think that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.980" end="00:24:28.030" style="s2">absolutely right you all right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.540" end="00:24:29.590" style="s2">think you what you were saying about an</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.030" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">ideology even though you think you may</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:33.550" style="s2">not be bound by if you live according to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:34.410" style="s2">it then you are indeed bound by it right</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.550" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.410" end="00:24:38.940" style="s2">and the evidence is right there right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:41.010" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t you know if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.940" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">take a criticism of it for example you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.010" end="00:24:46.860" style="s2">know another good one absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:49.500" style="s2">absolutely so there was one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.860" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">popped out of the video at me I was okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.500" end="00:24:52.530" style="s2">I was I thought this is gonna be a quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:53.670" style="s2">interesting topic for discussions</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.530" end="00:24:54.780" style="s2">remember we mentioned the four-minute</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.670" end="00:24:57.000" style="s2">mile thing well somebody did the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.780" end="00:24:58.380" style="s2">four-minute mile now ever since then</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.000" end="00:25:00.390" style="s2">everybody&#39;s been doing four-minute miles</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.380" end="00:25:01.740" style="s2">now high school high school kids can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.390" end="00:25:04.560" style="s2">four-minute miles do you remember that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.740" end="00:25:06.510" style="s2">little bit yeah so let me ask what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.560" end="00:25:08.490" style="s2">what you think about this do you think</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.510" end="00:25:10.260" style="s2">that it&#39;s as simple as once it&#39;s done by</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.490" end="00:25:11.790" style="s2">someone and people know it can be done</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.260" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">then you know it&#39;s just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.790" end="00:25:14.690" style="s2">confidence thing right oh well someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.980" style="s2">else did it therefore it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.690" end="00:25:18.150" style="s2">therefore I have a chance of doing it do</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.980" end="00:25:20.100" style="s2">you think it&#39;s as simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.150" end="00:25:22.800" style="s2">or do you think it&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.100" end="00:25:24.570" style="s2">profound and speaking to a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.800" end="00:25:26.040" style="s2">another layer of organization in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.570" end="00:25:27.990" style="s2">universe something along the line of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.040" end="00:25:29.870" style="s2">Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s morphic resonance</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.990" end="00:25:32.520" style="s2">where he says that you know once a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.870" end="00:25:34.140" style="s2">substance is crystallized once somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.520" end="00:25:36.180" style="s2">in the world in one lab somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.140" end="00:25:38.100" style="s2">world in other labs elsewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.180" end="00:25:40.140" style="s2">world it crystallizes more easily</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.100" end="00:25:41.700" style="s2">because somewhere in the universe is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.140" end="00:25:43.950" style="s2">imprint of the fact that that has been</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.700" end="00:25:46.470" style="s2">done now right and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.950" end="00:25:47.880" style="s2">a template for it if you like and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.470" end="00:25:50.790" style="s2">it&#39;s more easily accomplished in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.880" end="00:25:52.830" style="s2">future so well what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.790" end="00:25:54.270" style="s2">those two ideas in the explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.830" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">why the four-minute mile once it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.270" end="00:26:00.180" style="s2">done once was done a billion times</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:26:02.970" style="s2">afterwards you know I would say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.180" end="00:26:07.980" style="s2">probably some truth in both of them I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.970" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">know that&#39;s sort of a cop-out but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.980" end="00:26:11.630" style="s2">I do think that there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:14.100" style="s2">something to the first idea because</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.630" end="00:26:15.660" style="s2">there may you know take not even the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.100" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">four-minute mile take something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.660" end="00:26:21.510" style="s2">just never been done at all before you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2">know just the fact that somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.510" end="00:26:25.650" style="s2">somebody did it and now it&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.300" end="00:26:27.750" style="s2">makes it more likely that somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.650" end="00:26:29.340" style="s2">is gonna pick up on it and do it it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.750" end="00:26:32.010" style="s2">what the quality in ice skating wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.340" end="00:26:33.780" style="s2">it the for the for the for turn jump in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.010" end="00:26:35.550" style="s2">ice skate had done and then once it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.780" end="00:26:38.490" style="s2">done once every one includes it in their</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.550" end="00:26:41.160" style="s2">routine well and so it&#39;s so it may just</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.490" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">be as simple as the fact that you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.160" end="00:26:47.340" style="s2">well some of it could be technologically</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:48.179" style="s2">driven you know like say with an athlete</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.340" end="00:26:50.070" style="s2">it could be some</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.179" end="00:26:57.720" style="s2">thing about the equipment you know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.070" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">they&#39;re using you know the morphic</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.720" end="00:27:01.440" style="s2">resonance thing is really interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:03.179" style="s2">don&#39;t really know where I fall on that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.440" end="00:27:04.860" style="s2">have you have you come across the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.179" end="00:27:07.740" style="s2">before you familiar with Rupert children</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.860" end="00:27:10.440" style="s2">ah somewhat I mean I&#39;m familiar with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.740" end="00:27:12.570" style="s2">or vaguely but not you know not in any</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.440" end="00:27:14.429" style="s2">great detail I love it I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.570" end="00:27:19.110" style="s2">great idea for on a variety of levels</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.429" end="00:27:20.669" style="s2">are for example the DNA of a and we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.110" end="00:27:22.740" style="s2">one of the things that came up in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.669" end="00:27:24.840" style="s2">Joe Rogan podcast you guys are talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.740" end="00:27:29.759" style="s2">about was was ant colonies right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.840" end="00:27:31.830" style="s2">yeah you know the layout and design for</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.759" end="00:27:34.529" style="s2">an ant colony is not there in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.830" end="00:27:36.059" style="s2">individual ants DNA right somehow or</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.529" end="00:27:38.610" style="s2">other in the collaboration in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.059" end="00:27:41.730" style="s2">relationships between those ants the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.610" end="00:27:43.230" style="s2">design emerges from that right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.730" end="00:27:44.730" style="s2">very much an emergent thing from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.230" end="00:27:45.990" style="s2">design for collaboration so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.730" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">individuals and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.990" end="00:27:49.889" style="s2">relationships between those individuals</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:51.269" style="s2">and that whole mess out back to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.889" end="00:27:54.450" style="s2">coherence thing right it&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.269" end="00:27:58.139" style="s2">coherence in the ends right the colony</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.450" end="00:28:01.049" style="s2">emerges out of that and so his idea is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.139" end="00:28:03.090" style="s2">that somewhere in a place that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.049" end="00:28:04.529" style="s2">yet understand a little energy frequency</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.090" end="00:28:06.299" style="s2">or whatever that we that we haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.529" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t yet tapped into in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.299" end="00:28:09.720" style="s2">same way that stone men would have had</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:11.190" style="s2">no idea if there was radio signals</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.720" end="00:28:13.110" style="s2">passing over their heads right there and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.190" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">then no concept or in exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.110" end="00:28:19.529" style="s2">way there is this energy field of yet</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:22.369" style="s2">yet we have two of which we as yet have</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.529" end="00:28:24.509" style="s2">no knowledge which has you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.369" end="00:28:25.889" style="s2">templates like the immune system once</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.509" end="00:28:27.419" style="s2">you&#39;ve been exposed to a disease once</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.889" end="00:28:28.860" style="s2">somewhere in your immune system is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.419" end="00:28:30.299" style="s2">imprint of that you get exposed to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.860" end="00:28:32.429" style="s2">again it&#39;s ready to be rolled out</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.299" end="00:28:37.320" style="s2">straightaway same sort of principle as</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.429" end="00:28:40.639" style="s2">that is that do you think related to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.320" end="00:28:43.009" style="s2">know young in in a way like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.639" end="00:28:45.029" style="s2">collective unconscious kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.009" end="00:28:47.190" style="s2">absolutely I think that&#39;s related yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.029" end="00:28:51.059" style="s2">yeah I do yeah I mean I feel because I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.190" end="00:28:53.119" style="s2">was are you unconscious yeah my read of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.059" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">the collective unconscious is is also</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.119" end="00:29:01.780" style="s2">not so much metaphysical as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:04.810" style="s2">know I mean it just it&#39;s it is part</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.780" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">the DNA almost I mean it&#39;s like us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.810" end="00:29:13.000" style="s2">a it&#39;s an inherited collection of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">know archetypes that have born</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.000" end="00:29:17.890" style="s2">themselves out over time you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:20.770" style="s2">that&#39;s contained within each individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.890" end="00:29:22.870" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s contained in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.770" end="00:29:25.420" style="s2">universe at large and we somehow tuned</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.870" end="00:29:28.990" style="s2">into it as individuals no I think we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.420" end="00:29:33.910" style="s2">create it over time so you think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.990" end="00:29:35.560" style="s2">big out there I think we pass it on I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.910" end="00:29:39.100" style="s2">think it probably is within each</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.560" end="00:29:41.980" style="s2">individual right but it&#39;s not a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.100" end="00:29:43.510" style="s2">know it&#39;s a human experience resides in</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.980" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">some way I&#39;m not asking you to explain</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.510" end="00:29:48.360" style="s2">the mechanism but resides in some way</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:51.190" style="s2">within each individual it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.360" end="00:29:53.590" style="s2">she is I think it&#39;s by the individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:56.740" style="s2">but resides within I think it plays</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.590" end="00:29:58.780" style="s2">itself out within the individual yes so</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.740" end="00:30:01.060" style="s2">I mean from a certain sense it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.780" end="00:30:05.230" style="s2">we&#39;re all working on it together like we</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.060" end="00:30:06.760" style="s2">obviously share it but in the end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.230" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">something that plays out in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.760" end="00:30:11.740" style="s2">individual psyche</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:13.750" style="s2">you know when the rubber hits the road I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.740" end="00:30:16.560" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.750" end="00:30:21.190" style="s2">think it&#39;s like this other thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.560" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">you know tap into right we carry it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.190" end="00:30:28.300" style="s2">around okay and pass it on you know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:30.550" style="s2">I mean so it is okay okay that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.300" end="00:30:32.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a morphic resonance I do that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.550" end="00:30:35.320" style="s2">body plan for example in humans you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.530" end="00:30:36.550" style="s2">heart cells no has to become hard you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.320" end="00:30:37.930" style="s2">know some cells know to become a heart</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.550" end="00:30:39.220" style="s2">cells other cells now to become a brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.930" end="00:30:40.540" style="s2">cells and the ones in the right places</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.220" end="00:30:42.490" style="s2">and the body do the right thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.540" end="00:30:44.830" style="s2">all connect together in in in the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.490" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">way and and you know this fantastically</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.830" end="00:30:49.090" style="s2">complicated design just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">assembles itself now again there is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.090" end="00:30:53.950" style="s2">contained in the DNA the body plan is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">not contained in the DNA right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">potential to do all of the jobs and each</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:30:59.920" style="s2">and every cell does the making of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:03.820" style="s2">protein so on there is all in there but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.920" end="00:31:05.860" style="s2">the the meta thing is not is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.820" end="00:31:07.570" style="s2">contained in that so again is morphic</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.860" end="00:31:10.540" style="s2">resonance idea explains that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.570" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a stamp if you like you know but</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.540" end="00:31:15.520" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m not sure I can I I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:17.590" style="s2">I&#39;m doing a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.520" end="00:31:20.890" style="s2">good job of creating a picture of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.590" end="00:31:22.840" style="s2">but you know the human being at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.890" end="00:31:25.480" style="s2">moment of coming into existence is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.840" end="00:31:29.020" style="s2">stamped by this morphic resonance filled</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.480" end="00:31:30.610" style="s2">with the body plan of what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.020" end="00:31:33.430" style="s2">human being you know what I mean along</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.610" end="00:31:35.620" style="s2">with perhaps the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.430" end="00:31:37.180" style="s2">as it exists up until that moment kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.620" end="00:31:43.090" style="s2">of thing maybe I thought that possibly</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.180" end="00:31:45.880" style="s2">also yeah and so the so the morphic</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.090" end="00:31:51.240" style="s2">resonance would be an attempt to answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.880" end="00:31:55.180" style="s2">the question how does you know a cell</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.240" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">know what to do when it&#39;s you know in</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.180" end="00:32:00.270" style="s2">the embryonic stage yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:02.370" style="s2">you just got this ball of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.270" end="00:32:04.800" style="s2">undifferentiated stem cells and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.370" end="00:32:08.700" style="s2">they&#39;re dividing rapidly and somehow or</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.800" end="00:32:11.070" style="s2">other this one knows to turn into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.700" end="00:32:18.809" style="s2">liver and this one knows to turn your</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.070" end="00:32:20.400" style="s2">brain yeah it&#39;s very sequential and if</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.809" end="00:32:22.650" style="s2">it gets out of order you&#39;re all fuck</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.400" end="00:32:24.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a fucking mess right and so some</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.650" end="00:32:25.860" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a plan there&#39;s a code</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.330" end="00:32:28.140" style="s2">for all of this somewhere or other</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.860" end="00:32:31.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a and so why is it that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.140" end="00:32:34.020" style="s2">not in the DNA I&#39;m curious if there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.830" end="00:32:36.179" style="s2">the mechanism by which that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.020" end="00:32:40.020" style="s2">translated is as yet unknown so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.179" end="00:32:42.300" style="s2">sorry I the mechanism by which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.020" end="00:32:44.309" style="s2">translated if it is in there is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.300" end="00:32:57.000" style="s2">understood let&#39;s put it that way right</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.309" end="00:32:59.100" style="s2">right yes 20 trillion cells or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.000" end="00:33:00.690" style="s2">in the human body and god knows how many</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.100" end="00:33:03.540" style="s2">hundreds of different types of cells</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.690" end="00:33:05.670" style="s2">there are and you know they&#39;re dying and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.540" end="00:33:07.740" style="s2">coming into existence all the time all</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.670" end="00:33:11.250" style="s2">the time tens of millions of them a day</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.740" end="00:33:14.450" style="s2">you know and yeah it all just obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.250" end="00:33:16.350" style="s2">happens without our awareness but</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.450" end="00:33:18.710" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.350" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">template some kind of a blueprint that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.710" end="00:33:26.730" style="s2">this happens according to right see you</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:28.740" style="s2">want there to be like almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.730" end="00:33:31.429" style="s2">world of forms or something from which</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.740" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">all these thoughts on a card in well the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.429" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">reflection the I guess yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:38.010" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly certainly relation I</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:40.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know that I want it I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.010" end="00:33:42.540" style="s2">saying that I know I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.110" end="00:33:44.220" style="s2">idea of morphing it&#39;s it resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.540" end="00:33:46.710" style="s2">me if you know sometimes you hear ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.220" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">and they just yeah yeah yeah man I love</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.710" end="00:33:50.910" style="s2">that that really that feels right</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:52.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right of course but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.910" end="00:33:54.870" style="s2">just it just feels right and that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.740" end="00:33:58.020" style="s2">one of those ideas it just feels it</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.870" end="00:33:59.280" style="s2">explains a lot of mysterious things it</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.020" end="00:34:01.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really explain it because</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.280" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no mechanism there&#39;s no you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.080" end="00:34:05.190" style="s2">here it is this is I can show it to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s nothing like that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.190" end="00:34:09.210" style="s2">but nevertheless it explains a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:12.120" style="s2">a bit like terence mckenna&#39;s hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.210" end="00:34:14.310" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.120" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">evolution of the consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.310" end="00:34:17.850" style="s2">mankind being brought about by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:19.710" style="s2">that a lot of monkeys ate a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.850" end="00:34:21.900" style="s2">hallucinogenic plants right yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.710" end="00:34:23.100" style="s2">it&#39;s they an ape no way of proving this</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.900" end="00:34:27.060" style="s2">but it makes a lot of fucking sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.100" end="00:34:31.410" style="s2">right yeah for sure yeah I love that</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.060" end="00:34:33.450" style="s2">idea you know the thing about the likes</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.410" end="00:34:35.640" style="s2">so things like morphic resonance to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.450" end="00:34:38.670" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay that gives you a set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.640" end="00:34:40.340" style="s2">terms and ideas to use to describe</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.670" end="00:34:44.670" style="s2">something right that really can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.340" end="00:34:47.700" style="s2">described in a certain sense now it may</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.670" end="00:34:50.580" style="s2">be that Rupert Sheldrake thinks that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.700" end="00:34:52.410" style="s2">know there&#39;s something really like real</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.580" end="00:34:55.620" style="s2">there and I don&#39;t know I mean maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.410" end="00:34:59.310" style="s2">there may well be but it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.620" end="00:35:01.650" style="s2">useful to think about and I like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.310" end="00:35:03.660" style="s2">idea of resonance you know because</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.650" end="00:35:05.070" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of I mean we&#39;re all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.660" end="00:35:07.410" style="s2">operating at a certain you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.070" end="00:35:11.160" style="s2">frequency and and what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.410" end="00:35:13.320" style="s2">and coherence is a lot about resonating</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.160" end="00:35:15.150" style="s2">right harmonizing those frequencies</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.320" end="00:35:17.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t it&#39;s about finding and finding a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.150" end="00:35:20.280" style="s2">harmony not necessarily homogenizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.550" end="00:35:22.470" style="s2">them but but but stacking them in a new</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.280" end="00:35:25.020" style="s2">novel and complex way which creates a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.470" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">hitherto unknown harmony I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.020" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:38.130" style="s2">kind of what it&#39;s about right I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:40.080" style="s2">say that&#39;s true yeah I&#39;m told Rupert</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.130" end="00:35:41.910" style="s2">Sheldrake he&#39;s been somewhat vilified by</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.080" end="00:35:44.430" style="s2">the scientific community because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.910" end="00:35:47.540" style="s2">pretty out there but he&#39;s my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.430" end="00:35:51.270" style="s2">he&#39;s a true scientist in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.540" end="00:35:53.640" style="s2">you know he he comes up with reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.270" end="00:35:55.290" style="s2">explanations for phenomena and puts them</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.640" end="00:35:56.850" style="s2">forward as hypotheses and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.290" end="00:35:58.860" style="s2">entirely reasonable right he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.850" end="00:36:02.250" style="s2">offering them as theories he&#39;s offering</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.860" end="00:36:04.140" style="s2">them as hypotheses and he questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.250" end="00:36:06.990" style="s2">where the science has become somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.140" end="00:36:08.700" style="s2">doctrinal over the last few decades you</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.990" end="00:36:10.110" style="s2">know and questions the validity of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.700" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">huge number of the papers that are put</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.110" end="00:36:17.460" style="s2">out there is self referencing self</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:19.140" style="s2">peer-reviewed papers you know that have</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.460" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">no real they they&#39;re just out there in</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.140" end="00:36:26.059" style="s2">order to create firstly money for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:28.559" style="s2">publishing companies but also a bill</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.059" end="00:36:30.390" style="s2">an ability to give people masters and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.559" end="00:36:33.390" style="s2">PhDs you know what I mean so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.390" end="00:36:35.579" style="s2">these published stuff is kind of just to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.390" end="00:36:37.380" style="s2">put people through masters and PhD</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.579" end="00:36:40.650" style="s2">courses that I get the accreditation you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.380" end="00:36:42.690" style="s2">know so as a consequence of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.650" end="00:36:44.280" style="s2">criticisms not to mention the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.690" end="00:36:46.319" style="s2">he questions whether constants are</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.280" end="00:36:48.599" style="s2">really constant there seem to be changes</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.319" end="00:36:50.130" style="s2">in the value of the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.599" end="00:36:51.569" style="s2">constant the speed of light you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.130" end="00:36:53.940" style="s2">what I mean he seems to have things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.569" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">in to have fluctuated over time and if</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.940" end="00:36:59.730" style="s2">that is true would require a complete</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.589" style="s2">re-evaluation of our whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.730" end="00:37:03.450" style="s2">what what constant what it means for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.589" end="00:37:05.550" style="s2">constant to be a constant right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.450" end="00:37:07.349" style="s2">the entire universe is in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.550" end="00:37:09.000" style="s2">state of flux where the speed of light</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.349" end="00:37:10.619" style="s2">is not always the same the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.000" end="00:37:12.030" style="s2">constant is not always say a mass and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.619" end="00:37:14.790" style="s2">energy content at the universe is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.030" end="00:37:17.640" style="s2">always the same you know that if if that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.790" end="00:37:19.710" style="s2">were true and I&#39;m not saying it is but</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.640" end="00:37:20.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a reasonable question to ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.710" end="00:37:23.130" style="s2">because at the end of the day these</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.790" end="00:37:26.069" style="s2">things are assumptions right though then</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.130" end="00:37:27.900" style="s2">there is no way of demonstrating beyond</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.069" end="00:37:29.579" style="s2">a reasonable doubt that the total mass</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.900" end="00:37:32.309" style="s2">and energy in the universe never changes</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.579" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">right we&#39;ve never seen a change in any</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.309" end="00:37:36.299" style="s2">closed system but that does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:38.069" style="s2">necessarily that there is an energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.299" end="00:37:39.630" style="s2">being created and destroyed perhaps in</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.069" end="00:37:41.369" style="s2">equal quantities all the time in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.630" end="00:37:43.260" style="s2">universe you know me but it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.369" end="00:37:45.930" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t energy being created</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.260" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">and destroyed in the universe right well</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.930" end="00:37:52.140" style="s2">see that really resonates with my whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:55.970" style="s2">you know idea or just the perception</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.140" end="00:37:57.780" style="s2">that you know we&#39;re kind of we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.970" end="00:38:00.869" style="s2">dialectic with whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.780" end="00:38:03.569" style="s2">God you know and so the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.869" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">like we&#39;re co-creating you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.569" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2">thing on the fly essentially and so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:12.990" style="s2">idea that these constants would</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.180" end="00:38:17.099" style="s2">fluctuate is is right in line with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.990" end="00:38:21.299" style="s2">because you know and we&#39;re we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.099" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">interesting because we&#39;ve come in and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.299" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">with all the technology and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:28.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve changed a lot of the parameters in</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:32.190" style="s2">ways that you know no other living thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.530" end="00:38:35.670" style="s2">has up to this point and so in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.190" end="00:38:38.310" style="s2">ways you know that&#39;s that&#39;s playing god</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.670" end="00:38:41.050" style="s2">I guess in a sense but</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.310" end="00:38:42.550" style="s2">you know the fact that we&#39;re now in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.050" end="00:38:44.950" style="s2">kind of feedback loop where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.550" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">actually changing or setting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.950" end="00:38:52.349" style="s2">parameters within which we operate is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s quite amazing and scary</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.349" end="00:38:57.730" style="s2">have we not always done that is it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:39:00.460" style="s2">that no our power to do so is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.730" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">exponentially now is I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.460" end="00:39:05.320" style="s2">it&#39;s I think the technology you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:08.380" style="s2">that a lot that makes that happen is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.320" end="00:39:10.750" style="s2">much more powerful now and it&#39;s oh and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.380" end="00:39:12.220" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s on an exponential curve at</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.750" end="00:39:14.410" style="s2">the moment I mean you know it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.220" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">be anyway I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.410" end="00:39:18.070" style="s2">talked about this dozen years that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.900" style="s2">got a toolkit which you know has</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.070" end="00:39:21.700" style="s2">developed over millions and millions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.900" end="00:39:23.290" style="s2">millions of years and we&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.700" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">environment we developed over of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.290" end="00:39:27.160" style="s2">couple of centuries really decades if</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:29.380" style="s2">you want depending on how you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.160" end="00:39:31.450" style="s2">but whatever and you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.380" end="00:39:32.050" style="s2">random chance some of our toolkit works</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.450" end="00:39:33.700" style="s2">pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.050" end="00:39:36.010" style="s2">all those are completely not fit for</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.700" end="00:39:38.470" style="s2">purpose right it&#39;s just let&#39;s just sit</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.010" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s pretty random which work and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.470" end="00:39:42.940" style="s2">which don&#39;t that that&#39;s all pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.530" style="s2">random and so yeah that&#39;s intense the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.940" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">need for a game B right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.530" end="00:39:50.260" style="s2">okay be right and yeah exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:51.580" style="s2">and although it&#39;s not a accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.260" end="00:39:54.250" style="s2">I mean seriously at going back to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.580" end="00:39:56.530" style="s2">Terence Mckenna he thinks that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.250" end="00:39:58.660" style="s2">thing is on an exponential curve time</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.530" end="00:40:00.820" style="s2">itself he reckons is speeding up because</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.660" end="00:40:03.339" style="s2">as time goes on and things become more</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.820" end="00:40:05.710" style="s2">complex and more normal in any given</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.339" end="00:40:07.480" style="s2">unit of time there&#39;s more going on which</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.710" end="00:40:08.680" style="s2">means that time is going faster right</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.480" end="00:40:11.589" style="s2">there&#39;s more events occurring within</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.680" end="00:40:14.500" style="s2">that time he defines time as the space</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.589" end="00:40:16.540" style="s2">between events right and so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.500" end="00:40:20.680" style="s2">events and well you&#39;re compressing time</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.540" end="00:40:22.690" style="s2">basically and so time is speeding up</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.680" end="00:40:24.280" style="s2">exponentially which means evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.690" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">speeding up exponentially and I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.280" end="00:40:26.589" style="s2">gives a pretty obvious example you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.589" end="00:40:33.099" style="s2">years of you know or millions of years</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:35.080" style="s2">of your various pre Homo sapiens to homo</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.099" end="00:40:36.730" style="s2">sapiens and then you&#39;ve got you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.080" end="00:40:39.550" style="s2">maybe a few hundred thousand years to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.730" end="00:40:40.900" style="s2">aggregate to tools and so on then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.550" end="00:40:42.700" style="s2">got a few tens of thousands of years to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.900" end="00:40:44.230" style="s2">agriculture and then a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.700" end="00:40:46.180" style="s2">millennia to industrial and then a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.230" end="00:40:48.010" style="s2">couple of centuries to information you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.180" end="00:40:50.830" style="s2">know what I mean in this whole there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.010" end="00:40:51.589" style="s2">the the whole thing is just just on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.830" end="00:40:55.160" style="s2">on an X</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.589" end="00:40:57.469" style="s2">thing yeah so then what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.160" end="00:40:59.569" style="s2">run up against the like biological</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.469" end="00:41:01.430" style="s2">reality that you know bodies just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.569" end="00:41:03.079" style="s2">change that fast that&#39;s exactly where we</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.430" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">are now isn&#39;t it that&#39;s exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.079" end="00:41:07.759" style="s2">run up against right now is exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:10.069" style="s2">is exactly that it&#39;s like we&#39;re reaching</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.759" end="00:41:12.950" style="s2">some kind of critical you know mass or</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.069" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">something think sorry gone no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.950" end="00:41:17.150" style="s2">just like we&#39;re reaching some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:18.650" style="s2">critical point in that curve you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.150" end="00:41:22.789" style="s2">where the two things are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.650" end="00:41:25.339" style="s2">crossing each other kind of up until</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.789" end="00:41:29.210" style="s2">relatively recently technology has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.339" end="00:41:30.950" style="s2">primarily about assisting the biology</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.210" end="00:41:33.170" style="s2">right so it&#39;s washing machines and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.950" end="00:41:35.390" style="s2">refrigerators and cars and roads and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.170" end="00:41:37.369" style="s2">transportation systems and running water</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.390" end="00:41:39.559" style="s2">and electricity and all of these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.369" end="00:41:41.749" style="s2">of things which for the organism itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.559" end="00:41:43.430" style="s2">right the biological organism these were</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.749" end="00:41:46.400" style="s2">all good things for the biological</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.430" end="00:41:48.229" style="s2">organism itself and so adaptation of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.400" end="00:41:50.539" style="s2">biological organism not really required</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.229" end="00:41:52.579" style="s2">until relatively recently when</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.539" end="00:41:55.880" style="s2">technology has started to take on a form</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.579" end="00:41:57.769" style="s2">which is no longer just about assisting</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.880" end="00:41:59.329" style="s2">the biological organism it&#39;s gone beyond</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.769" end="00:42:01.729" style="s2">that right it&#39;s gone into realms which</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.329" end="00:42:03.529" style="s2">is way beyond the biological nature of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.729" end="00:42:05.239" style="s2">the organism which is why of course the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.529" end="00:42:06.170" style="s2">biology is now running into conflict</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.239" end="00:42:07.849" style="s2">would you would you agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.170" end="00:42:10.190" style="s2">analysis that sound reasonable to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.849" end="00:42:13.009" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;re saying well I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.190" end="00:42:16.579" style="s2">don&#39;t know the so cars let&#39;s see so</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.009" end="00:42:20.390" style="s2">let&#39;s run it back the up until a certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.579" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">point technology was really there to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.390" end="00:42:28.009" style="s2">assist biology yeah the needs of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:30.200" style="s2">biological organism yeah well comfort</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.009" end="00:42:34.119" style="s2">you know right but I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.200" end="00:42:35.749" style="s2">that transportation maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.119" end="00:42:38.749" style="s2">transportation was maybe not the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.749" end="00:42:41.869" style="s2">example but certainly medicine and yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.749" end="00:42:43.789" style="s2">and electricity and machinery and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.869" end="00:42:45.469" style="s2">know being able to increase production</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.789" end="00:42:46.969" style="s2">of food increased production of goods</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.469" end="00:42:50.089" style="s2">you know all of it all of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.969" end="00:42:52.219" style="s2">people saying Isis you know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.089" end="00:42:53.660" style="s2">sorts of things is reducing the amount</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.219" end="00:42:56.809" style="s2">of danger the amount of time the amount</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.660" end="00:42:58.279" style="s2">of effort that goes into yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.809" end="00:43:00.410" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t know it just pops into my</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.279" end="00:43:02.599" style="s2">head but I delayed yeah so then when</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.410" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">that so then you run that up to a point</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.599" end="00:43:09.170" style="s2">where it&#39;s no longer really serving the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:10.580" style="s2">interest of the organism I mean I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.170" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">not the needs of the boil not the needs</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.580" end="00:43:15.610" style="s2">of the biology right so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:18.710" style="s2">Internet the mobile phone network the I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.610" end="00:43:22.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know the extended working days the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.710" end="00:43:23.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m trying to think of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.070" end="00:43:25.400" style="s2">other examples but you know internet and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.960" end="00:43:26.780" style="s2">Mobile&#39;s is the motto of our most of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.400" end="00:43:28.790" style="s2">disease and most transformations right</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.780" end="00:43:30.770" style="s2">and I mean the thing about it the thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.790" end="00:43:32.270" style="s2">about all of that ends up being that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.770" end="00:43:34.520" style="s2">know like especially if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.270" end="00:43:38.330" style="s2">something like social media that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.520" end="00:43:41.090" style="s2">know really does not serve the interests</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.330" end="00:43:45.890" style="s2">of the organism because I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.090" end="00:43:49.850" style="s2">know that we&#39;re really capable of you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.890" end="00:43:54.290" style="s2">know having meaningful discussion in</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.850" end="00:43:55.730" style="s2">groups of that size well the problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.290" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">with the social media I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.730" end="00:43:59.000" style="s2">well documented but the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:43:59.990" style="s2">social media is this echo chamber thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.000" end="00:44:01.820" style="s2">right is that he tends to gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.990" end="00:44:03.590" style="s2">towards those who think the same as you</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.820" end="00:44:05.210" style="s2">do and then and so you never really have</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.590" end="00:44:06.620" style="s2">any interesting discussions I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.210" end="00:44:08.120" style="s2">think you and I could probably be</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.620" end="00:44:10.340" style="s2">accused of that we&#39;re obviously broadly</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.120" end="00:44:12.470" style="s2">on the same page in terms of how we see</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.340" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">things and you know that we&#39;re it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.470" end="00:44:17.120" style="s2">right well so you have you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">have to you have really like two issues</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.120" end="00:44:22.940" style="s2">with that like on the one hand I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:24.620" style="s2">just the fact that we&#39;re in you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.940" end="00:44:26.990" style="s2">fact that you can find echo chambers is</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">one problem right and and I&#39;m certainly</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.990" end="00:44:33.530" style="s2">guilty of that you know I try to step</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:35.960" style="s2">outside of that on purpose because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.530" end="00:44:39.260" style="s2">at least aware that that&#39;s a problem or</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.960" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">it can be a problem right but then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.260" end="00:44:43.940" style="s2">also have the issue of just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:46.850" style="s2">get together with that many people and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.940" end="00:44:48.470" style="s2">come to a consensus you know I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.850" end="00:44:50.780" style="s2">is not you know there&#39;s Dunbar&#39;s number</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.470" end="00:44:53.180" style="s2">and all of these things about you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.780" end="00:44:56.570" style="s2">how many people can you really go here</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.180" end="00:44:58.730" style="s2">with and so some pretty fucking big</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.570" end="00:45:02.690" style="s2">arguments about stuff I&#39;m quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:06.050" style="s2">they did but it was easier for them to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.690" end="00:45:08.360" style="s2">come to a consensus you know because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.050" end="00:45:09.950" style="s2">was us just a smaller number of people I</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.360" end="00:45:12.170" style="s2">think even more importantly than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.950" end="00:45:14.180" style="s2">consensus is the fact that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.170" end="00:45:16.580" style="s2">feels that they have had a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.180" end="00:45:19.110" style="s2">hear have their voice heard in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.580" end="00:45:21.360" style="s2">process as it played out right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.110" end="00:45:23.310" style="s2">in 2000 sends a thousands millions that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.360" end="00:45:25.530" style="s2">every individual has no chance of having</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.310" end="00:45:27.060" style="s2">their voice heard groups need you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.530" end="00:45:29.820" style="s2">groups inevitably going to form within</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.060" end="00:45:31.260" style="s2">that larger group and representatives of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.820" end="00:45:32.700" style="s2">those groups are now the ones that need</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.260" end="00:45:34.950" style="s2">to have the discussions with each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.700" end="00:45:36.210" style="s2">we&#39;re right in the whole identity group</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.950" end="00:45:37.170" style="s2">thing because not every member of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.210" end="00:45:41.730" style="s2">group feels the same way about</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.170" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">everything blah blah blah but then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.730" end="00:45:48.510" style="s2">layer on top of that you know this sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:51.330" style="s2">of like global corporate financial you</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.510" end="00:45:55.890" style="s2">know system and the military-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.330" end="00:46:00.570" style="s2">complex but I mean like these things</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.890" end="00:46:02.850" style="s2">then run amok you know with the and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.570" end="00:46:05.880" style="s2">D let&#39;s see what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.850" end="00:46:10.110" style="s2">you know disenfranchised individuals</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.880" end="00:46:13.500" style="s2">even more and make individuals feel less</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.110" end="00:46:15.690" style="s2">powerful less you know agency less</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.500" end="00:46:20.550" style="s2">ownership and what&#39;s going on you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.690" end="00:46:22.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s a bad spot to be in by the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.550" end="00:46:24.660" style="s2">fact that the u.s. electorate saw fit to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.500" end="00:46:26.700" style="s2">choose Donald Trump you know not only in</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.660" end="00:46:28.080" style="s2">the primaries but then in the general</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.700" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">election as well not that Hillary was</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.080" end="00:46:32.190" style="s2">much of a thing but you know that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:33.390" style="s2">the most awful you&#39;re an American</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.190" end="00:46:35.160" style="s2">citizen right so I mean obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.390" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">got your right in the thick of it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.160" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">it was the most even for an outsider it</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:42.840" style="s2">was the most awful horrible election to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:47.010" style="s2">watch because you know everybody hated</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.840" end="00:46:48.540" style="s2">both candidates basically so I saw make</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.010" end="00:46:50.130" style="s2">a really good point I mean it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.540" end="00:46:51.060" style="s2">when you hear it but but I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.130" end="00:46:53.010" style="s2">really thought about it in those terms</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.060" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">at the the main reason that Trump won</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.010" end="00:46:56.010" style="s2">the election was because he was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:57.420" style="s2">Republican candidate you know it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.010" end="00:47:00.180" style="s2">simple as that it&#39;s got nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.420" end="00:47:03.420" style="s2">with Trump with Trump himself but he was</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.180" end="00:47:04.920" style="s2">the Republican nominee and Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.420" end="00:47:06.870" style="s2">were in the majority of presidencies and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.920" end="00:47:09.210" style="s2">this as simple as fucking they&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.870" end="00:47:12.200" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know I have a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.210" end="00:47:16.040" style="s2">different read on that but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.200" end="00:47:20.580" style="s2">there&#39;s so my line on all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.040" end="00:47:23.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a round about the 70s the late</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.580" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">70s you know coming out of well actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.790" end="00:47:27.960" style="s2">I mean you can take it all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:31.020" style="s2">to World War two and or the even the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.960" end="00:47:32.420" style="s2">depression and FDR and so there was</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.020" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2">really a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.420" end="00:47:38.150" style="s2">politics you know in the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:41.450" style="s2">Party and in this in the States really</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.150" end="00:47:44.060" style="s2">in general and then you carry that on</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.450" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">into world war two and a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.060" end="00:47:49.010" style="s2">people really fought for those</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:51.170" style="s2">progressive values that FDR stood for</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.010" end="00:47:54.260" style="s2">right and then you move that into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.170" end="00:47:57.460" style="s2">50s and 60s and then you have all this</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.260" end="00:48:00.170" style="s2">unrest in the 60s right socially and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.460" end="00:48:04.010" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting a culture war at that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.170" end="00:48:06.320" style="s2">point and so then somewhere like in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.010" end="00:48:08.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really with Carter I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.320" end="00:48:11.360" style="s2">you know and and going into Reagan</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.060" end="00:48:15.880" style="s2">obviously like there gets this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.360" end="00:48:18.680" style="s2">this financial arrangement between</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.880" end="00:48:21.650" style="s2">essentially center right and center left</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.680" end="00:48:23.300" style="s2">and this new kind of what we call now I</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.650" end="00:48:25.610" style="s2">mean what I would call the neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.300" end="00:48:29.140" style="s2">project right and I mean I guess Tony</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.610" end="00:48:38.210" style="s2">Blair was huge in you know the Third Way</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.140" end="00:48:40.610" style="s2">politics and that whole thing is go I</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.210" end="00:48:43.550" style="s2">mean that&#39;s decades of this sort of idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.610" end="00:48:47.870" style="s2">you know that we can sort of toe the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.550" end="00:48:51.350" style="s2">line and and work together and for</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.870" end="00:48:54.760" style="s2">decades it&#39;s just benefited you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.350" end="00:48:57.050" style="s2">people with money and influence and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.760" end="00:49:00.710" style="s2">disenfranchised a whole bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.050" end="00:49:02.300" style="s2">on the left and right frankly this has</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.710" end="00:49:04.730" style="s2">been a quite deliberate strategy by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.300" end="00:49:06.140" style="s2">by the rich people oh sure they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.730" end="00:49:07.640" style="s2">doing for centuries and centuries you</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.140" end="00:49:10.120" style="s2">know and at the whole absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.640" end="00:49:12.320" style="s2">democracy thing was just the latest</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.120" end="00:49:13.790" style="s2">accommodation that they made in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.320" end="00:49:15.290" style="s2">actually even though it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.790" end="00:49:18.350" style="s2">people have more individual liberty</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.290" end="00:49:20.450" style="s2">actually it was just a more subtle veil</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.350" end="00:49:22.910" style="s2">placed on the control mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.450" end="00:49:24.830" style="s2">always existed sure but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.910" end="00:49:27.230" style="s2">government has functioned in in</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.830" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">progressive ways in the past you know it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.230" end="00:49:31.640" style="s2">just it doesn&#39;t ever seem to hold</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:34.310" style="s2">because you know the capitalists just</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:38.540" style="s2">find a new way to you know make more you</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.310" end="00:49:41.510" style="s2">know to wedge in and and you know crowd</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.540" end="00:49:44.360" style="s2">out the competitors and all of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.510" end="00:49:46.370" style="s2">of thing but you know my read on trunk</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.360" end="00:49:48.890" style="s2">was that this is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.370" end="00:49:50.690" style="s2">it&#39;s finally a you know a full-on you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.890" end="00:49:53.210" style="s2">know that&#39;s a populist reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.690" end="00:49:55.790" style="s2">basically a corporatist strategy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.210" end="00:49:57.590" style="s2">been going on for decades yeah it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.790" end="00:49:59.090" style="s2">I mean I think Russell Brand hit the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.590" end="00:50:00.530" style="s2">nail on the head we said it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.090" end="00:50:01.910" style="s2">possible with Trump in office it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.530" end="00:50:04.700" style="s2">longer possible to look at the political</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.910" end="00:50:06.110" style="s2">system and think it&#39;s okay yeah to think</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:08.690" style="s2">that it works to think that it functions</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.110" end="00:50:10.790" style="s2">in any even most rudimentary way if it</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.690" end="00:50:14.090" style="s2">can produce that you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.790" end="00:50:16.100" style="s2">then then then it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.090" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally and profoundly and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.100" end="00:50:21.650" style="s2">irredeemably broken okay so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">so then let&#39;s take this political</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.650" end="00:50:28.220" style="s2">conversation and let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:32.900" style="s2">conceptualize like what what game B has</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.220" end="00:50:35.870" style="s2">to bring to the table and how you know D</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.900" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">do you see a way that game B can I do</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.870" end="00:50:41.540" style="s2">actually sort of interject itself into</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">that conversation no no not at all but</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.540" end="00:50:45.080" style="s2">just as you were just as he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:47.330" style="s2">we need to find a way to bring game B to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.080" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">bear on this problem as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.330" end="00:50:52.070" style="s2">there something pops into my head which</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:53.630" style="s2">is not a new idea and it&#39;s not the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.070" end="00:50:56.690" style="s2">time I&#39;ve had this I&#39;m not first time I</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.630" end="00:50:59.600" style="s2">think it fits here&#39;s is all I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.690" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">is the idea of decentralization though I</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.600" end="00:51:04.490" style="s2">think for a long time the state has</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:06.410" style="s2">become more and more and more unwieldy</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.490" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">you know what I mean and and more and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.410" end="00:51:10.610" style="s2">more decisions are made in a central way</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:13.580" style="s2">for everybody to go along with and III I</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.610" end="00:51:16.430" style="s2">think the game be absolutely has a role</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.580" end="00:51:19.730" style="s2">to play in a more decentralized approach</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.430" end="00:51:21.530" style="s2">to power and wealth and resource</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.730" end="00:51:24.260" style="s2">distribution or I mean decisions being</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.530" end="00:51:27.650" style="s2">made at a more local level because it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.260" end="00:51:29.510" style="s2">so hard to scale game B you know even</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.650" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">across hundreds let alone millions you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.510" end="00:51:32.750" style="s2">know what I mean it seems to me to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:35.210" style="s2">a lot of sense you&#39;re trying to play</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.750" end="00:51:38.180" style="s2">game B it seems to me to make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.210" end="00:51:41.960" style="s2">sense of devolve decision-making down to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.180" end="00:51:47.420" style="s2">group size is where game B can sensibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.960" end="00:51:49.970" style="s2">be played you know what I mean I do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.420" end="00:51:52.850" style="s2">know that&#39;s related in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.970" end="00:51:56.450" style="s2">to the transition between you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.850" end="00:52:00.020" style="s2">Jordan calls the blue church and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.450" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">broadcast model you know into this</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.020" end="00:52:06.650" style="s2">where we are now which is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:11.510" style="s2">decentralized you know means of you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.650" end="00:52:12.920" style="s2">sense-making yeah but that is as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.510" end="00:52:14.930" style="s2">already taught is the camps that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.920" end="00:52:17.600" style="s2">creates right you know I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.930" end="00:52:20.330" style="s2">think it&#39;s improved sense I mean it</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.330" end="00:52:26.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s improved actual this</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.050" end="00:52:27.530" style="s2">making of sense by people because of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.420" end="00:52:28.670" style="s2">this camps thing that we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.530" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">talked about you know the echo chamber</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.670" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">and the creating of unification of you</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:35.180" style="s2">know ideologically driven camps on</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:37.220" style="s2">social media and on well on all</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.180" end="00:52:38.780" style="s2">platforms really you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.220" end="00:52:40.100" style="s2">really hard to avoid you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.780" end="00:52:41.840" style="s2">watch a video on YouTube the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.100" end="00:52:43.790" style="s2">recommendations it comes up with will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.840" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">videos similar to the one that you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.790" end="00:52:47.570" style="s2">watched you know what I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really very anything&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.570" end="00:52:50.690" style="s2">chosen if you you know look something up</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:51.830" style="s2">and you&#39;ve watched it and it&#39;s showing</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.690" end="00:52:53.240" style="s2">you recommend all that looks interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.830" end="00:52:54.050" style="s2">it&#39;s bound to look interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.240" end="00:52:55.580" style="s2">because you&#39;ve been interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.050" end="00:52:57.890" style="s2">first thing and before you know it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.580" end="00:52:59.270" style="s2">you&#39;re in this loop of watching thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.890" end="00:53:01.430" style="s2">after thing after thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.270" end="00:53:03.230" style="s2">actually all pretty closely related I</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.430" end="00:53:05.120" style="s2">mean don&#39;t get me wrong I love YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.230" end="00:53:07.310" style="s2">you can find anything you want on</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.120" end="00:53:09.050" style="s2">YouTube tutorials information history</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.310" end="00:53:12.620" style="s2">lessons whatever you want you know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.050" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">I mean but but it&#39;s very evil to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.620" end="00:53:16.490" style="s2">the echo-chamber thing you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:20.150" style="s2">very easy to get into a pattern where</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.490" end="00:53:23.900" style="s2">you&#39;re basically just you know watching</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.150" end="00:53:26.570" style="s2">things that confirm your assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.900" end="00:53:29.330" style="s2">yeah instead of challenging those</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.570" end="00:53:30.680" style="s2">assumptions you know yeah and this has</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.330" end="00:53:32.360" style="s2">to be a feature of game B right is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.680" end="00:53:33.590" style="s2">regularly challenging your assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.360" end="00:53:36.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to got to got to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.590" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">comfortable with having shot assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.140" end="00:53:41.930" style="s2">challenged or you&#39;re not fit to play</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:43.130" style="s2">game B yeah well and so that when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.930" end="00:53:44.510" style="s2">feel you&#39;re right cousin matter how many</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.130" end="00:53:47.060" style="s2">people are telling you that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.510" end="00:53:48.740" style="s2">right if you honestly you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.060" end="00:53:50.270" style="s2">face of having listened to all arguments</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.740" end="00:53:53.000" style="s2">against and you see yes we will need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.270" end="00:53:55.820" style="s2">stand your ground as well right people</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.000" end="00:53:57.500" style="s2">tell you yeah and you know it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.820" end="00:54:02.180" style="s2">like at some point they were getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.500" end="00:54:05.570" style="s2">into this individual versus collective</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.180" end="00:54:10.430" style="s2">thing which I mean I gotta say I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.570" end="00:54:12.460" style="s2">you know I have real issues with that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.430" end="00:54:16.849" style="s2">just can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.460" end="00:54:19.609" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say you know those who</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.849" end="00:54:23.150" style="s2">want to call the individual you know the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.609" end="00:54:26.150" style="s2">proper unit of analysis or they want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.150" end="00:54:28.700" style="s2">say that individual freedom is the most</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.150" end="00:54:32.299" style="s2">important thing and trumps everything I</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.700" end="00:54:35.089" style="s2">can certainly see a case to be made for</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.299" end="00:54:37.849" style="s2">that you know but I can also see on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.089" end="00:54:40.339" style="s2">other side it&#39;s like when you really get</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.849" end="00:54:44.779" style="s2">down to it I mean you&#39;re not an</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.339" end="00:54:48.950" style="s2">individual without you know something to</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.779" end="00:54:51.979" style="s2">be compared to you or you know norms and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.950" end="00:54:54.039" style="s2">mores that are created together so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.979" end="00:54:59.539" style="s2">like it just can&#39;t be one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.039" end="00:55:02.299" style="s2">no I think that&#39;s in terms of society in</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.539" end="00:55:04.999" style="s2">terms of the social contract that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.299" end="00:55:06.499" style="s2">eternal right at the base of everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.999" end="00:55:08.059" style="s2">else right underneath everything else</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.499" end="00:55:10.579" style="s2">all of the other conflicts that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.059" end="00:55:13.700" style="s2">eternal question isn&#39;t it to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.579" end="00:55:16.910" style="s2">is it acceptable to give up individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.700" end="00:55:19.160" style="s2">self-determination to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.910" end="00:55:22.369" style="s2">cohesive smooth functioning society</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.160" end="00:55:24.289" style="s2">because obviously no society functions</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.369" end="00:55:25.819" style="s2">if everybody can do whatever the hell</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.289" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">they want wherever the hell they feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.819" end="00:55:30.140" style="s2">like you know what I mean there then</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:32.719" style="s2">there has to be some curtailing of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.140" end="00:55:37.249" style="s2">in order for people to live together in</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.719" end="00:55:39.979" style="s2">a mutually beneficial manner right so to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.249" end="00:55:43.700" style="s2">what extent is it acceptable to place</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.979" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">limitations on self-expression freedom</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.700" end="00:55:47.569" style="s2">individual liberty whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:49.880" style="s2">cry and I suppose like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.569" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">libertarian minded person would say well</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.880" end="00:55:52.759" style="s2">they would come up with something like</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:54.380" style="s2">the non-aggression principle or</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.759" end="00:55:56.420" style="s2">something where you know as long as</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.380" end="00:56:00.529" style="s2">you&#39;re not infringing on somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.420" end="00:56:02.450" style="s2">rights yeah but that&#39;s the conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.529" end="00:56:04.069" style="s2">right between two people who want to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.450" end="00:56:05.749" style="s2">something and by both of them wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.069" end="00:56:08.680" style="s2">do it they&#39;re impinging on each other in</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.749" end="00:56:11.749" style="s2">some way right it&#39;s not as clear-cut as</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.680" end="00:56:13.099" style="s2">process I mean that&#39;s reasonable right</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.749" end="00:56:17.390" style="s2">you need a conflict resolution process</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.099" end="00:56:19.369" style="s2">which all parties buy into and are you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.390" end="00:56:22.549" style="s2">know have confidence in the in the in</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.369" end="00:56:24.229" style="s2">the fairness of if you like right which</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.549" end="00:56:26.270" style="s2">is what our legal system is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.229" end="00:56:29.210" style="s2">be is exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.270" end="00:56:32.210" style="s2">flic resolution system which is as fair</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.210" end="00:56:33.620" style="s2">as possible in principle I kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.210" end="00:56:35.870" style="s2">the idea where you have laws written</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.620" end="00:56:37.700" style="s2">down these are these are the guideline</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.870" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">principles right these are the basic</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.700" end="00:56:42.580" style="s2">do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of our society but we</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:45.260" style="s2">understand that no written rule</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.580" end="00:56:46.580" style="s2">universally applied can ever be fair or</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.260" end="00:56:48.920" style="s2">just right there&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.580" end="00:56:50.810" style="s2">circumstances which in which you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.920" end="00:56:52.700" style="s2">things become a good big ray which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.810" end="00:56:54.700" style="s2">why you have jewelry&#39;s and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.700" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">written law is tempered with</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.700" end="00:56:58.340" style="s2">understanding of the context and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:00.260" style="s2">individual situation at a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.340" end="00:57:03.290" style="s2">compassion and and and whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.260" end="00:57:05.480" style="s2">and so that the principle of that I like</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.290" end="00:57:08.920" style="s2">where it gets into problems in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.480" end="00:57:10.790" style="s2">opinion is when judges are appointed</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.920" end="00:57:12.860" style="s2">politically you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.790" end="00:57:15.290" style="s2">politics is driven by money and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.860" end="00:57:17.150" style="s2">basically and the people with more money</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.290" end="00:57:19.220" style="s2">can buy better lawyers and get better</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.150" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">legal interpretations and have better</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.220" end="00:57:24.470" style="s2">ways of manipulating legal language to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:26.780" style="s2">fit their own ends and all of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.470" end="00:57:29.420" style="s2">of thing that the spirit of honest</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.780" end="00:57:31.130" style="s2">good-faith conflict resolution has now</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.420" end="00:57:33.100" style="s2">become lost which is which is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.130" end="00:57:35.540" style="s2">supposed to will be rooted in right</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.100" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">right well and I mean that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.540" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">so what you&#39;re describing there is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:41.570" style="s2">same thing that happened that happens</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:44.150" style="s2">with central government for example</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.570" end="00:57:46.040" style="s2">family no absolutely so I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.150" end="00:57:48.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s like hey who doesn&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.040" end="00:57:51.820" style="s2">idea of having interstate highways you</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.200" end="00:57:54.260" style="s2">know that are maintained you know across</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.820" end="00:57:58.520" style="s2">municipalities and states and all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.260" end="00:58:00.560" style="s2">that but you know you get money involved</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.520" end="00:58:03.670" style="s2">and then you get you know within then</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.560" end="00:58:06.080" style="s2">you start talking about you know war and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.670" end="00:58:08.270" style="s2">you know the military-industrial complex</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.080" end="00:58:09.470" style="s2">and all that stuff and it&#39;s like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.270" end="00:58:11.900" style="s2">minute wait a minute wait a minute you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.470" end="00:58:13.730" style="s2">know so that&#39;s where you get into like</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.900" end="00:58:17.600" style="s2">oh we really need some place to reboot</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.730" end="00:58:20.840" style="s2">from well in my opinion game B doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.600" end="00:58:24.200" style="s2">work while we have money cut profit</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.840" end="00:58:26.300" style="s2">competitive advantage being sought III</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.200" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">don&#39;t see game B works under this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.300" end="00:58:31.070" style="s2">one of the groups that I&#39;m associated</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:33.170" style="s2">with is the money free party and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.070" end="00:58:35.090" style="s2">zeitgeist movement both of whom advocate</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.170" end="00:58:37.100" style="s2">for resource-based economics which does</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.849" end="00:59:00.020" style="s2">technology as it should you know as it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:04.520" style="s2">should be used if you know what I mean</p>

<p begin="00:59:07.730" end="00:59:14.150" style="s2">involved in there it&#39;s like well so</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.140" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something like global commerce</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.150" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">just go away under that there are always</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:23.480" style="s2">going to be certain things which exist</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:24.740" style="s2">in some parts of the world and not in</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.480" end="00:59:26.660" style="s2">other parts of the world you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.740" end="00:59:28.910" style="s2">raw materials for example which are</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.660" end="00:59:31.910" style="s2">important for the manufacture of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.910" end="00:59:36.140" style="s2">so no I mean I but I think it changes</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.910" end="00:59:38.420" style="s2">its nature it no longer goes from you</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.140" end="00:59:40.099" style="s2">know those with money can access it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.420" end="00:59:42.050" style="s2">those without money card they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.099" end="00:59:44.750" style="s2">know a different decision-making process</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.050" end="00:59:47.150" style="s2">is put into play I mean I I think a</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.150" end="00:59:52.670" style="s2">endure under a monetary system is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.490" end="00:59:55.130" style="s2">real scarcity right it&#39;s care staff oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.670" end="00:59:57.500" style="s2">that goods remain high-priced and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.130" end="00:59:59.660" style="s2">therefore more profitable right and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.500" end="01:00:02.119" style="s2">you know I really think not that I see a</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.660" end="01:00:03.950" style="s2">clear pathway to get from a money ridden</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.119" end="01:00:05.540" style="s2">well to a world without money because</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.950" end="01:00:08.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty big fucking step right I</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.540" end="01:00:09.579" style="s2">mean just philosophically mentally</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.030" end="01:00:13.339" style="s2">emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.579" end="01:00:15.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a giant leap right but I do</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.339" end="01:00:17.720" style="s2">honestly believe in my heart that money</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.770" end="01:00:19.160" style="s2">fucks everything up not not the money</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.720" end="01:00:21.050" style="s2">itself but the behavior that the money</p>

<p begin="01:00:30.650" end="01:00:35.359" style="s2">just brings it and I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.349" end="01:00:36.920" style="s2">these tendencies existed all of us right</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:38.150" style="s2">I really believe in that Solzhenitsyn</p>

<p begin="01:00:51.740" end="01:00:56.690" style="s2">mean it seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.990" end="01:00:58.430" style="s2">a cataclysmically bad thing but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.690" end="01:01:00.339" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done so going back to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.430" end="01:01:03.230" style="s2">the original question about Commerce</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.339" end="01:01:06.410" style="s2">yeah there would be exchanges of things</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.230" end="01:01:07.940" style="s2">but in you know back in the original</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.410" end="01:01:10.839" style="s2">ideas about in Smith you don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.940" end="01:01:13.700" style="s2">the original spirit of mutual mutual</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.839" end="01:01:15.500" style="s2">benefit you know what I mean not one</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.700" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">exploiting the other not one profiting</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.500" end="01:01:20.630" style="s2">at the expense of the other exchanges in</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:22.970" style="s2">mutual interest so that&#39;s where we get</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.630" end="01:01:25.789" style="s2">back to coherence and like I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.970" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">level of the level of trust that would</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.789" end="01:01:31.099" style="s2">be required absolutely or something like</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:37.789" style="s2">that to operate in the world is just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.099" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">long way away and I mean it gets</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.789" end="01:01:42.200" style="s2">dismissed up results based economics</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:44.059" style="s2">gets dismissed by people as oh it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.200" end="01:01:46.039" style="s2">Marxism riots just communism in another</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.059" end="01:01:49.720" style="s2">form and in a way it is right because</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.039" end="01:01:52.339" style="s2">everybody now has direct inputs into</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.720" end="01:01:53.720" style="s2">what that which affects their lives you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.339" end="01:01:55.549" style="s2">know what I mean there&#39;s like rings</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.720" end="01:01:57.859" style="s2">within rings within rings within rings</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.549" end="01:01:59.690" style="s2">within rings of organisation because as</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.859" end="01:02:01.339" style="s2">you quite rightly said we need to build</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.690" end="01:02:02.690" style="s2">roads across countries right you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.339" end="01:02:05.270" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that with a dozen people</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.690" end="01:02:08.539" style="s2">you need to find ways of collaborating</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.270" end="01:02:10.789" style="s2">and so you have you know the family unit</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.539" end="01:02:12.710" style="s2">the the neighborhood unit the town unit</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.789" end="01:02:15.500" style="s2">the city unit the county unit the city</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.710" end="01:02:17.420" style="s2">and these things all overlay with each</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.500" end="01:02:20.059" style="s2">other and are in cooperation with each</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.420" end="01:02:21.740" style="s2">other of course all possible scales and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.059" end="01:02:23.869" style="s2">dimensions you know I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.740" end="01:02:25.670" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a magnificent and beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.869" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">thing and AI has there has the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.670" end="01:02:32.180" style="s2">capability of making sense of it all if</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:36.049" style="s2">you know what I mean hmm you just threw</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.180" end="01:02:37.700" style="s2">that in there huh well I don&#39;t I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.049" end="01:02:41.299" style="s2">as soon as you put people in charge of</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.700" end="01:02:42.470" style="s2">decision-making I I just think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.299" end="01:02:45.410" style="s2">asking for trouble do you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.470" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">mean III later there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.410" end="01:02:49.400" style="s2">someone&#39;s doing someone a favor</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">someone&#39;s making a decision based on</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.400" end="01:02:55.150" style="s2">less than the best possible of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">information or whatever you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.150" end="01:03:02.809" style="s2">well it does seem to me like you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:05.930" style="s2">capitalism did what it set out to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.809" end="01:03:08.050" style="s2">which was essentially to you know create</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.930" end="01:03:11.540" style="s2">innovation or whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.050" end="01:03:13.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s come to a point where like I</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.540" end="01:03:15.980" style="s2">mean you know Jordan Peterson would even</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.160" end="01:03:18.020" style="s2">admit this that you know all hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.980" end="01:03:20.869" style="s2">have a tendency to become top-heavy and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.020" end="01:03:23.570" style="s2">dis possess the vast majority at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.869" end="01:03:26.660" style="s2">bottom yeah yeah and that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.570" end="01:03:28.340" style="s2">I think the primary hierarchies in which</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.660" end="01:03:29.690" style="s2">all of the other cuz I I did a video</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.340" end="01:03:31.220" style="s2">about this actually which was very</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.690" end="01:03:32.840" style="s2">quickly I mean I think his basic point</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.220" end="01:03:34.430" style="s2">about our hierarchies are not corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.840" end="01:03:36.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t have bounds of plumbers you</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.430" end="01:03:37.250" style="s2">know corrupt plumbers walking up and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.050" end="01:03:39.470" style="s2">down the street demand you cease their</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.250" end="01:03:40.760" style="s2">services I think that&#39;s right broadly</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.470" end="01:03:42.440" style="s2">speaking when you&#39;re just dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.760" end="01:03:44.090" style="s2">people on a day to day basis I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.440" end="01:03:46.430" style="s2">that&#39;s right you know I think it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.090" end="01:03:47.990" style="s2">competence that is primarily what puts</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.430" end="01:03:50.150" style="s2">people in their positions power in</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.990" end="01:03:52.369" style="s2">communities and stuff yeah I on smaller</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.150" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">scales soon as you get into the really</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.369" end="01:03:56.630" style="s2">big giant powerful hierarchies finance</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:03:58.820" style="s2">governor and politics and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.630" end="01:04:00.230" style="s2">media this kind of thing I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.820" end="01:04:02.150" style="s2">not true I think these my rock is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.230" end="01:04:04.580" style="s2">really really super corrupt you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.150" end="01:04:07.580" style="s2">they&#39;ve just had and I think it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.580" end="01:04:10.090" style="s2">matter of time before that just happens</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.580" end="01:04:13.310" style="s2">on its own I mean anytime you set up</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.090" end="01:04:15.530" style="s2">hierarchies you know especially when</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.310" end="01:04:17.960" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about power and resources</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.530" end="01:04:20.350" style="s2">and you know competition and things I</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.960" end="01:04:23.960" style="s2">mean it&#39;s just naturally gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.350" end="01:04:27.770" style="s2">especially when the individuals are so</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.960" end="01:04:29.300" style="s2">disconnected you know and you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.770" end="01:04:31.670" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like you have ownership in</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.300" end="01:04:33.950" style="s2">the thing and so use you start to check</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.670" end="01:04:35.720" style="s2">out anyway and then the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.950" end="01:04:37.160" style="s2">the power they&#39;re the only ones that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.720" end="01:04:40.430" style="s2">checked in because they&#39;re the only ones</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.160" end="01:04:44.470" style="s2">that can make it do anything this whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.430" end="01:04:47.540" style="s2">labor for money contract you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.470" end="01:04:48.619" style="s2">you&#39;re sound like a Marxist agrarian you</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.540" end="01:04:49.700" style="s2">don&#39;t give a fuck about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.619" end="01:04:51.650" style="s2">doing right you&#39;re not putting your</p>

<p begin="01:06:16.700" end="01:06:21.410" style="s2">right and I&#39;m essentially because we</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.830" end="01:06:23.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have any other choice I was having</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.410" end="01:06:24.800" style="s2">a conversation with someone on online</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.000" end="01:06:27.530" style="s2">the other day we&#39;re talking talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.800" end="01:06:30.530" style="s2">about 10 years or so ago in the UK we</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.530" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">had the conservative liberal Alliance</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.530" end="01:06:37.400" style="s2">right and the Liberals reneged on their</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.160" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">pledges about student fees and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.400" end="01:06:40.610" style="s2">hated them so the next election</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:42.340" style="s2">everybody voted against them and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.610" end="01:06:45.740" style="s2">voted for the Tories who were you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.340" end="01:06:48.440" style="s2">continual starett e-rate lower taxes for</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.740" end="01:06:50.330" style="s2">the rich people but cut public services</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.440" end="01:06:52.490" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah you know but it</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.330" end="01:06:54.650" style="s2">was just a reaction and to get something</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.490" end="01:06:55.970" style="s2">different so they voted for their own</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.650" end="01:06:57.410" style="s2">impoverishment you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.970" end="01:06:58.850" style="s2">millions and millions and millions of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.410" end="01:07:09.700" style="s2">people voted for their own deep and</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.850" end="01:07:09.700" style="s2">impoverishment right truck sorry Oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.329" end="01:07:13.689" style="s2">I was just gonna say you do have to ask</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.769" end="01:07:15.160" style="s2">the question what actual alternatives</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.689" end="01:07:17.199" style="s2">are there when it comes to election time</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.160" end="01:07:18.939" style="s2">you know what I mean right right well I</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.199" end="01:07:21.999" style="s2">mean and so obviously at some point you</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.939" end="01:07:24.130" style="s2">have to just say okay I got a you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.999" end="01:07:26.979" style="s2">to work with what I&#39;ve got you know I</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.130" end="01:07:29.410" style="s2">think the challenge for people like us</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.979" end="01:07:32.170" style="s2">is gonna be like okay and more more</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.410" end="01:07:35.019" style="s2">probably the people who are leading the</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.170" end="01:07:37.929" style="s2">charge say is like you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.019" end="01:07:42.359" style="s2">the idea is at least what I get from</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.929" end="01:07:47.380" style="s2">Brett Weinstein is like game B is</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.359" end="01:07:51.279" style="s2">supposed to be able to out-compete game</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.380" end="01:07:52.749" style="s2">a in some way have you picked up on that</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.279" end="01:07:54.910" style="s2">at all it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.749" end="01:07:57.369" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s about complexity and he</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.910" end="01:08:00.369" style="s2">draws a distinction between complex and</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.369" end="01:08:02.380" style="s2">complicated complex being a mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.369" end="01:08:05.410" style="s2">term yeah for a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.380" end="01:08:07.420" style="s2">unpredictable system where you know tiny</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.410" end="01:08:08.739" style="s2">changes in input leads a huge change</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.420" end="01:08:11.979" style="s2">you&#39;ll feel familiar with the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.739" end="01:08:13.509" style="s2">chaos and complex systems yes so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.979" end="01:08:16.480" style="s2">what he mean he&#39;s saying the game is</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.509" end="01:08:18.579" style="s2">unable to cope with complexity because</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.480" end="01:08:24.339" style="s2">it&#39;s systems of decision-making are</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.579" end="01:08:25.239" style="s2">linear right they are saying I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.339" end="01:08:26.529" style="s2">saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.239" end="01:08:28.650" style="s2">my take on what he&#39;s saying and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.529" end="01:08:31.690" style="s2">right but what&#39;s it gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.650" end="01:08:33.639" style="s2">complexity because it&#39;s a nonlinear</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.690" end="01:08:36.009" style="s2">dynamic right and therefore it has the</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.639" end="01:08:38.699" style="s2">capacity to cope with complexity so</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.009" end="01:08:38.699" style="s2">what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.259" end="01:08:44.060" style="s2">a just totally fucking destroying</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.630" end="01:08:45.410" style="s2">everything before game B Kenny you broke</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.060" end="01:08:48.170" style="s2">up on me a little bit they gonna need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.410" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">repeat that well so my question then</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.170" end="01:08:52.310" style="s2">would be what&#39;s it gonna take is it</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:54.680" style="s2">gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.310" end="01:08:57.529" style="s2">game age it&#39;s totally fucking destroying</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.680" end="01:08:59.630" style="s2">everything before we get to the point</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.529" end="01:09:02.480" style="s2">where game B looks good enough to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.630" end="01:09:04.700" style="s2">everybody enough people yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.480" end="01:09:06.830" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.700" end="01:09:08.989" style="s2">question that I grappled with a lot but</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.830" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">one of the main drivers all the</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.989" end="01:09:11.810" style="s2">resources of the above the</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:13.430" style="s2">resource-based economics moment is a guy</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.810" end="01:09:17.000" style="s2">called Jacque fresco he died a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.430" end="01:09:19.489" style="s2">years ago the age of 102 or ever quite a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.000" end="01:09:22.310" style="s2">character anyway he is of the opinion</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.489" end="01:09:23.810" style="s2">that until game a he didn&#39;t caught he</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.310" end="01:09:25.370" style="s2">didn&#39;t conceptualize in that way he</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.810" end="01:09:29.540" style="s2">didn&#39;t call it game a but same idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.370" end="01:09:32.930" style="s2">until game a spectacularly fails and is</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.540" end="01:09:34.700" style="s2">seen to fail and is known to be you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.930" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">unfit for purpose</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.700" end="01:09:40.940" style="s2">only then will people seek the neces you</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:44.270" style="s2">know the necessarily necessarily radical</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.940" end="01:09:48.819" style="s2">solutions that are out there it feels</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.270" end="01:09:48.819" style="s2">like we can&#39;t be terribly far from there</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.740" end="01:09:56.420" style="s2">you know I mean it seemed like well I</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.750" end="01:09:59.360" style="s2">just feels like we can&#39;t be terribly far</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.420" end="01:10:01.220" style="s2">from that but you know who knows maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.360" end="01:10:07.190" style="s2">that&#39;s just the echo chamber that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.220" end="01:10:11.510" style="s2">into right but yeah I tend to agree I</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.190" end="01:10:14.870" style="s2">mean I but I don&#39;t see hahaha</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.510" end="01:10:17.150" style="s2">I don&#39;t see us moving smoothly from game</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.870" end="01:10:19.510" style="s2">a to game be I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.150" end="01:10:21.950" style="s2">happening but they said something about</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.510" end="01:10:23.300" style="s2">like in this video there&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.950" end="01:10:27.740" style="s2">where they make mention of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.300" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">transitional generations generations of</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.740" end="01:10:34.730" style="s2">people ie centuries of time kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">thing yeah I yeah a long yeah I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.730" end="01:10:39.770" style="s2">don&#39;t see that no I see a much more if</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:42.500" style="s2">game B is to is to take over from game a</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.770" end="01:10:45.710" style="s2">I see a much more likely scenario being</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.500" end="01:10:49.490" style="s2">the widespread collapse of game a very</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.710" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">large numbers of people you know wiped</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.490" end="01:10:56.720" style="s2">out and from the ashes emerges okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:10:59.240" style="s2">people playing game B I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.720" end="01:11:01.430" style="s2">that&#39;s all but you know it could just as</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.240" end="01:11:09.520" style="s2">likely be small groups of people going</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.430" end="01:11:12.050" style="s2">back to what&#39;s-his-name B groups dot</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.520" end="01:11:13.970" style="s2">Dunbar Dunbar groups you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.050" end="01:11:18.580" style="s2">mean they can dump the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.970" end="01:11:21.260" style="s2">equilibrium that actually see yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.580" end="01:11:22.700" style="s2">mean that would be that would be great I</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.260" end="01:11:28.790" style="s2">mean you know but it&#39;s just like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.700" end="01:11:30.470" style="s2">so much it&#39;s so complicated right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.790" end="01:11:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem right well because</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.470" end="01:11:34.820" style="s2">that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not complex enough</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.480" end="01:11:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s too complicated the tendrils of</p>

<p begin="01:11:49.790" end="01:11:55.070" style="s2">everywhere and so in a way I do think</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.090" end="01:11:56.780" style="s2">the correct a level of attack or the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.070" end="01:11:59.090" style="s2">correct level of analysis is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.780" end="01:12:03.930" style="s2">individual because only as individuals</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.090" end="01:12:05.400" style="s2">do we have the ability to constrain evil</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.930" end="01:12:07.020" style="s2">within our own hearts you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.400" end="01:12:08.610" style="s2">mean and in our own actions only as</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.020" end="01:12:10.230" style="s2">individual right but do we have the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.610" end="01:12:13.160" style="s2">power to do that right and Mike look at</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.230" end="01:12:15.420" style="s2">Nazi Germany I guess right exactly so</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.160" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s individuals but then of course as</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.420" end="01:12:18.900" style="s2">individuals as limits to what we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:21.930" style="s2">actually accomplish in the world you</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.900" end="01:12:23.760" style="s2">know what I mean and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.930" end="01:12:25.800" style="s2">a paradox in that sense on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.760" end="01:12:28.620" style="s2">change has to happen at the individual</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.800" end="01:12:30.240" style="s2">level before it can happen at the growth</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.620" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">at the metal level you know at the multi</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.240" end="01:12:36.000" style="s2">level but at the same time none of those</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:39.570" style="s2">individual changes manifest in the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.000" end="01:12:41.640" style="s2">at large really until enough people have</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.570" end="01:12:45.090" style="s2">done it so that they can now collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.640" end="01:12:46.370" style="s2">and and and and create physical changes</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.090" end="01:12:49.440" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.370" end="01:12:52.890" style="s2">yeah and change systems and things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.440" end="01:12:56.400" style="s2">that yeah it&#39;s almost like you need like</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.890" end="01:12:58.100" style="s2">a you need an experimental space some</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.400" end="01:13:00.480" style="s2">you know you need you need some</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.100" end="01:13:04.260" style="s2">billionaire to buy an island and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.480" end="01:13:07.910" style="s2">know try stuff out yeah a few thousand</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.260" end="01:13:07.910" style="s2">people there and try stuff out and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.320" end="01:13:13.620" style="s2">you know you put in but actually that</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.550" end="01:13:16.260" style="s2">would be a that would be a great idea I</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.620" end="01:13:18.120" style="s2">mean that really would be I love that</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.260" end="01:13:20.010" style="s2">idea I&#39;m not quite sure how you go about</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.120" end="01:13:22.890" style="s2">actually doing it but I love that idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.010" end="01:13:25.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not you know I don&#39;t know anybody</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.890" end="01:13:26.850" style="s2">capable of doing that reset and start</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.470" end="01:13:29.210" style="s2">again any time the damage is always</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.850" end="01:13:32.700" style="s2">contained it&#39;s not like you&#39;re risking</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.210" end="01:13:34.680" style="s2">the entire global infrastructure on on</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.700" end="01:13:36.930" style="s2">an untested idea you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.680" end="01:13:38.370" style="s2">you can you can run it at least on a</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.930" end="01:13:39.900" style="s2">small scale and of course there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.370" end="01:13:42.870" style="s2">going to be changes as you scale things</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.900" end="01:13:46.230" style="s2">up but at least you can try on a medium</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.870" end="01:13:47.100" style="s2">scale before going fright that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.230" end="01:13:48.900" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.100" end="01:13:51.870" style="s2">well I mean in the thing is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.900" end="01:13:54.330" style="s2">challenge really is scalability yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.870" end="01:13:57.750" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I mean you know what</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.330" end="01:13:59.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve done is scaled I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.750" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">the broadcast model really did well was</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.700" end="01:14:05.910" style="s2">scale and you know they were able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.120" end="01:14:08.640" style="s2">control the message right because it was</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.910" end="01:14:11.640" style="s2">only coming from a few trusted sources</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.640" end="01:14:12.420" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s just not the landscape</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.640" end="01:14:14.340" style="s2">we&#39;re in anymore</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.420" end="01:14:16.540" style="s2">no the source is the source is lost</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.340" end="01:14:19.090" style="s2">there or</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.540" end="01:14:21.550" style="s2">already he may or may not have been</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.090" end="01:14:24.250" style="s2">people did trust and I mean listen I I</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.550" end="01:14:25.630" style="s2">don&#39;t really know I was a kid or I or it</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.250" end="01:14:27.220" style="s2">was before my time but you know the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.630" end="01:14:30.370" style="s2">walkers the Walter Cronkite&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.220" end="01:14:33.400" style="s2">Dan Rather of this world you know as I</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.370" end="01:14:35.290" style="s2">understand it people really did trust</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.400" end="01:14:36.970" style="s2">what they had to say and you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.290" end="01:14:39.400" style="s2">his name Walter Cronkite stop the war</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.970" end="01:14:41.740" style="s2">but stop the Vietnam War exactly I was</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.400" end="01:14:48.580" style="s2">just gonna says something to that effect</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.740" end="01:14:53.710" style="s2">so and III would I I think we are poorer</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.580" end="01:14:56.770" style="s2">for not having those trusted voices that</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.710" end="01:14:59.110" style="s2">you could rely on for at least as best</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.770" end="01:15:00.280" style="s2">they knew it we&#39;re passing on truth to</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.110" end="01:15:03.040" style="s2">you you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.280" end="01:15:04.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s never truth it&#39;s always part of</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.040" end="01:15:07.150" style="s2">the truth you know doing but at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.360" end="01:15:09.700" style="s2">this part of it is true as best we know</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.150" end="01:15:11.170" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t deliberately we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.700" end="01:15:12.610" style="s2">deliberately you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.170" end="01:15:14.410" style="s2">pushed it one way or the other to try</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.610" end="01:15:18.130" style="s2">and create a perception in your mind you</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.410" end="01:15:20.350" style="s2">know yeah yeah that&#39;s gone it&#39;s gone man</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.130" end="01:15:25.090" style="s2">it&#39;s gone I mean I don&#39;t I can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.350" end="01:15:27.510" style="s2">of a single person or channel that I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.090" end="01:15:31.480" style="s2">go to that I absolutely trust there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.510" end="01:15:34.930" style="s2">agenda there yeah right so that puts a</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.480" end="01:15:37.060" style="s2">lot more of the you know the onus on you</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.930" end="01:15:39.550" style="s2">as an individual to like whether you</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.060" end="01:15:42.550" style="s2">want it or not or whether you even are</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.550" end="01:15:45.750" style="s2">aware of that or not like there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.550" end="01:15:49.870" style="s2">more discernment that has to go on</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.750" end="01:15:50.620" style="s2">because you can&#39;t just trust it no no</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.870" end="01:15:52.660" style="s2">you really can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.620" end="01:15:56.170" style="s2">you&#39;re on in Venezuela as an excellent</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.660" end="01:15:58.450" style="s2">example I mean the the the primary</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.170" end="01:16:01.780" style="s2">narrative about Venezuela is that Madero</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.450" end="01:16:03.940" style="s2">is a dictator that he&#39;s impoverishing</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.780" end="01:16:05.860" style="s2">his people that people are starving in</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.940" end="01:16:07.480" style="s2">the streets that there&#39;s riots now I</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.860" end="01:16:09.880" style="s2">hear from other sources and I have no</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.480" end="01:16:11.560" style="s2">idea the truth where the truth lies in</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.880" end="01:16:13.000" style="s2">this I&#39;m absolutely no idea I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.560" end="01:16:14.770" style="s2">any Venezuelans I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.000" end="01:16:15.940" style="s2">first-hand knowledge I&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.770" end="01:16:18.150" style="s2">there you know what I mean so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.940" end="01:16:21.970" style="s2">talking from no but I know other sources</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.150" end="01:16:23.530" style="s2">sources which I basically trust although</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.970" end="01:16:25.150" style="s2">I don&#39;t trust anyone completely but that</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.530" end="01:16:27.490" style="s2">I basically trusted are saying no that</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.150" end="01:16:29.860" style="s2">the u.s. is waging an economic war on</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.490" end="01:16:30.189" style="s2">Madero and this is why they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.860" end="01:16:32.439" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.189" end="01:16:34.419" style="s2">there because you know supply lines have</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.439" end="01:16:36.070" style="s2">been cut this sanctions there&#39;s and and</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.419" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">so on and so on but Madero is actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.070" end="01:16:39.400" style="s2">Madeira I&#39;m slightly getting his name</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:40.840" style="s2">wrong it&#39;s something like that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.400" end="01:16:43.389" style="s2">slightly getting his name of it anyway</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.840" end="01:16:44.889" style="s2">but his he was elected by whatever</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.389" end="01:16:47.889" style="s2">eighty percent of the people that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.889" end="01:16:49.269" style="s2">people are you know squarely behind him</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.889" end="01:16:51.969" style="s2">for the most part that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.269" end="01:16:53.889" style="s2">anti-government protests are small</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.969" end="01:16:56.289" style="s2">numbers of people financed by the CIA</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.889" end="01:16:57.880" style="s2">blah blah blah blah now you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.289" end="01:17:00.280" style="s2">have two more different stories here</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.880" end="01:17:03.400" style="s2">right where&#39;s the truth and as an</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.280" end="01:17:05.260" style="s2">outside observer where can I go to</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.400" end="01:17:07.209" style="s2">someone who will tell me what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.260" end="01:17:09.039" style="s2">happening there which of these version</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.209" end="01:17:12.099" style="s2">of events is closer to the truth where</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.039" end="01:17:14.559" style="s2">do I go for that yeah I mean there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.099" end="01:17:16.329" style="s2">way and I don&#39;t know the the I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.559" end="01:17:18.010" style="s2">don&#39;t even know that under the old model</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.329" end="01:17:20.619" style="s2">there was anywhere you know because at</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.010" end="01:17:23.739" style="s2">some point it just becomes like too far</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.619" end="01:17:28.110" style="s2">removed from where you are to have any</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.739" end="01:17:28.110" style="s2">accurate picture from anybody you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.860" end="01:17:33.849" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s frustrating because you</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.050" end="01:17:36.159" style="s2">want to have an accurate understanding</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.849" end="01:17:39.459" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on but at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.159" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s impossible so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.459" end="01:17:44.669" style="s2">assume that there is probably some bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.400" end="01:17:46.900" style="s2">of truth on both sides of that equation</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.669" end="01:17:48.550" style="s2">yeah I mean it goes back to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.900" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">saying right at the very very start</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.550" end="01:17:53.769" style="s2">about the space between yes and no right</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:55.989" style="s2">it&#39;s about holding all of that stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.769" end="01:17:58.269" style="s2">your head at the same time and not</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.989" end="01:18:00.669" style="s2">settling on any of it right holding all</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.269" end="01:18:02.979" style="s2">of it lightly you know there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.669" end="01:18:04.479" style="s2">some truth mixed up in all of it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.979" end="01:18:06.280" style="s2">know what it is and until more</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.479" end="01:18:08.619" style="s2">information comes along I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.280" end="01:18:10.989" style="s2">have to hold the uncertainty right yep</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.619" end="01:18:13.389" style="s2">and you have to be comfortable with that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.989" end="01:18:16.539" style="s2">Ryan so that goes back to patience and</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.389" end="01:18:20.229" style="s2">humility that you know was in this video</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.539" end="01:18:23.979" style="s2">and the the idea that you know there was</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.229" end="01:18:25.570" style="s2">this other idea that so we were taught</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.979" end="01:18:30.159" style="s2">we were talking earlier about you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.570" end="01:18:32.320" style="s2">when the resonance happens you know how</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.159" end="01:18:33.760" style="s2">how do you maintain it or what do you do</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:36.669" style="s2">with it and like what you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.760" end="01:18:38.709" style="s2">greenhalgh makes this thing about you</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.669" end="01:18:41.320" style="s2">know you&#39;ll so you have the significant</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.709" end="01:18:43.060" style="s2">breakthrough and it happens and</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.320" end="01:18:45.100" style="s2">everybody recognizes it</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.060" end="01:18:46.960" style="s2">and then what we do is that we are way</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.100" end="01:18:50.950" style="s2">too quick to take that as being the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.960" end="01:18:54.040" style="s2">breakthrough yeah as opposed to saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.950" end="01:18:57.420" style="s2">okay we had that and now that starts a</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.040" end="01:19:01.150" style="s2">process you know a new process of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.420" end="01:19:05.350" style="s2">understanding and assimilating that</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.150" end="01:19:07.660" style="s2">breakthrough and embodying that and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.350" end="01:19:11.050" style="s2">know looking for the next one instead of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.660" end="01:19:13.900" style="s2">taking it as the thing and so again</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.050" end="01:19:18.300" style="s2">that&#39;s about patience and about being</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.900" end="01:19:23.200" style="s2">able to hold on to two apparently</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.300" end="01:19:27.280" style="s2">mutually exclusive ideas you know let me</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.200" end="01:19:30.820" style="s2">ask you something I mean the three of</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.280" end="01:19:32.650" style="s2">them Daniel Jamie and Jordan and the two</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.820" end="01:19:37.690" style="s2">of us broadly in this conversation we</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.650" end="01:19:41.200" style="s2">talked about game being quite nebulous</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.690" end="01:19:43.510" style="s2">esoteric kind of terms right and</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.200" end="01:19:51.670" style="s2">necessarily so to a certain degree right</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.510" end="01:19:54.280" style="s2">but in terms of its utility what am I</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.670" end="01:19:58.180" style="s2">trying to say here there needs to be an</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.280" end="01:20:02.230" style="s2">interface between the non-semantic world</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.180" end="01:20:04.270" style="s2">of game B and the literal semantic world</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.230" end="01:20:06.180" style="s2">that we inhabit most of the time right</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.270" end="01:20:08.800" style="s2">because I mean I don&#39;t see us living</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.180" end="01:20:10.990" style="s2">permanently in that game B space right</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.800" end="01:20:12.820" style="s2">you know yet we enter into it and as we</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.990" end="01:20:14.710" style="s2">become more practice we do so in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.820" end="01:20:17.350" style="s2">deliberate way right</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.710" end="01:20:19.270" style="s2">presumably to fulfill a particular need</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.350" end="01:20:22.810" style="s2">a particular function or just to</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.270" end="01:20:26.350" style="s2">maintain a sense of cohesion and and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.810" end="01:20:28.840" style="s2">you know unity and and whatever in there</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.350" end="01:20:31.600" style="s2">in the group but there needs to be some</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.840" end="01:20:34.150" style="s2">sort of interface right between if you</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.600" end="01:20:36.970" style="s2">like the real world and the and the and</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.150" end="01:20:39.630" style="s2">the special world that game be in</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.970" end="01:20:43.780" style="s2">inhabits you know does that make sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.630" end="01:20:46.450" style="s2">yeah it does I mean you know what I the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.780" end="01:20:48.220" style="s2">thing that I mean that&#39;s the thing I</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.450" end="01:20:49.660" style="s2">always come back to you know when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.220" end="01:20:53.650" style="s2">thinking about this stuff is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.660" end="01:20:56.729" style="s2">okay what is it that&#39;s gonna allow these</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.650" end="01:20:59.099" style="s2">two things to co-exist for a sir</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.729" end="01:21:02.760" style="s2">period of time yeah because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.099" end="01:21:04.829" style="s2">gonna be I mean unless it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.760" end="01:21:07.590" style="s2">catastrophic scenario where game a</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.829" end="01:21:09.829" style="s2">catastrophic Li fails and a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.590" end="01:21:12.989" style="s2">of people fuckin you know mass</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.829" end="01:21:16.050" style="s2">casualties and you know it&#39;s hell on</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.989" end="01:21:19.280" style="s2">earth for a while you know there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.050" end="01:21:22.110" style="s2">have to be a period of time when game B</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.280" end="01:21:24.179" style="s2">exists alongside game a in order to</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.110" end="01:21:27.659" style="s2">essentially out-compete it at some point</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.179" end="01:21:30.479" style="s2">yeah and I don&#39;t know what that looks</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.659" end="01:21:32.489" style="s2">like exactly well is the end goal to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.479" end="01:21:34.019" style="s2">game being all the time so whether</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.489" end="01:21:36.840" style="s2">you&#39;re with one person or whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.019" end="01:21:38.940" style="s2">you know you know in a theater with 200</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.840" end="01:21:42.090" style="s2">others that you you&#39;re in a constant</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.940" end="01:21:43.739" style="s2">state of connection and coherence I mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.090" end="01:21:46.380" style="s2">as well I mean I do think a certain</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.739" end="01:21:51.690" style="s2">degree of coherence you know can be</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.380" end="01:21:57.479" style="s2">maintained you know this idea of global</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.690" end="01:21:59.309" style="s2">consciousness and the third rising you</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.479" end="01:22:01.429" style="s2">know and and always being in this I</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.309" end="01:22:05.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know I mean that sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.429" end="01:22:08.280" style="s2">an eight well it sounds like to me like</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.070" end="01:22:10.889" style="s2">a state that just doesn&#39;t it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.280" end="01:22:13.889" style="s2">be maintained in a sense you know it</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.889" end="01:22:15.739" style="s2">should be sort of like you go there and</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.889" end="01:22:18.179" style="s2">you know then you come back and</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.739" end="01:22:20.489" style="s2">reassemble whatever you need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.179" end="01:22:21.059" style="s2">reassemble in order to actually act in</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.489" end="01:22:24.090" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.059" end="01:22:26.159" style="s2">in that sense yeah I mean that could be</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.090" end="01:22:27.570" style="s2">game a thinking in that you need the</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.159" end="01:22:30.659" style="s2">assimilation sign that you know if</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.570" end="01:22:32.789" style="s2">you&#39;re in the assimilation happens in</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.659" end="01:22:34.469" style="s2">real time as you go kind of thing maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.789" end="01:22:35.729" style="s2">when you&#39;re playing game be fully and</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.469" end="01:22:38.159" style="s2">you&#39;re fully immersed in it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.729" end="01:22:41.280" style="s2">all practiced that&#39;s it you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.159" end="01:22:43.590" style="s2">maybe that retreating retreating for</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:45.539" style="s2">assimilation maybe maybe that becomes</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.590" end="01:22:49.019" style="s2">not necessary it happens as you go maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.539" end="01:22:50.459" style="s2">well yeah it could you know but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.019" end="01:22:52.260" style="s2">again it goes back to what you were</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.459" end="01:22:56.940" style="s2">saying about you know Jordan&#39;s line</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.260" end="01:22:59.429" style="s2">about the you know the words as pointers</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.940" end="01:23:01.679" style="s2">you know and and what I&#39;m really trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.429" end="01:23:06.179" style="s2">to do when we talk is I&#39;m really trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.679" end="01:23:10.640" style="s2">to evoke in you you know a certain kind</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.179" end="01:23:13.270" style="s2">of felt experience you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.640" end="01:23:16.550" style="s2">and so in that way I think you could I</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.270" end="01:23:20.650" style="s2">think you could maintain that you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.550" end="01:23:23.900" style="s2">and be aware of that more often than not</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.650" end="01:23:26.390" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the romantic idea isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.900" end="01:23:27.710" style="s2">to be level with people all the time you</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.390" end="01:23:31.460" style="s2">know what I mean yeah yeah but the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.710" end="01:23:32.510" style="s2">problem is really it&#39;s the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.460" end="01:23:34.040" style="s2">you do with your lover you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.510" end="01:23:35.239" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the kind of communication</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.040" end="01:23:36.590" style="s2">you have with your lover maybe with your</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.239" end="01:23:39.050" style="s2">children you know the name but is it</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.590" end="01:23:41.060" style="s2">kind of level of closeness and intimacy</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.050" end="01:23:43.190" style="s2">I mean that would be a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.060" end="01:23:45.500" style="s2">to have at large in the world that would</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.190" end="01:23:47.750" style="s2">be fucking yeah so I mean but there it</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.500" end="01:23:50.719" style="s2">is right the level of trust that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.750" end="01:23:54.380" style="s2">involved in that is massive yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.719" end="01:23:55.940" style="s2">know and the fact that you know the idea</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.380" end="01:23:58.640" style="s2">that you could be out there trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.940" end="01:24:00.110" style="s2">play that game and that not everybody</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.640" end="01:24:03.800" style="s2">else is really interested in playing</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.110" end="01:24:14.180" style="s2">that game yeah that&#39;s hard that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.800" end="01:24:16.190" style="s2">quite brutally in fact really to think</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.180" end="01:24:19.310" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna make yourself that</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.190" end="01:24:20.810" style="s2">vulnerable you know without being a</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.310" end="01:24:23.000" style="s2">hundred percent sure that it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.810" end="01:24:26.680" style="s2">work out for you is well if you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.000" end="01:24:26.680" style="s2">show then you don&#39;t make you cellphone</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.580" end="01:24:34.600" style="s2">that&#39;s fair but I mean to me I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.880" end="01:24:40.510" style="s2">what I would hope comes out of this</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.600" end="01:24:45.440" style="s2">would be to develop some real specific</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.510" end="01:24:51.440" style="s2">strategies to create institutions that</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:53.360" style="s2">are more game be oriented yeah in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.440" end="01:24:55.130" style="s2">guilt trip a couple of very good points</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.360" end="01:24:57.770" style="s2">I think which would be helpful I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.130" end="01:25:00.050" style="s2">perhaps at least in the transition</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.770" end="01:25:02.360" style="s2">towards game be if not in full-on game</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.050" end="01:25:04.250" style="s2">be be a redundant in full-on game be you</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.360" end="01:25:06.170" style="s2">may to suggest you saying in debate when</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.250" end="01:25:07.850" style="s2">people are debating with each other when</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.170" end="01:25:09.830" style="s2">one person has made their argument</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.850" end="01:25:12.340" style="s2">before the responder makes their</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.830" end="01:25:14.660" style="s2">argument they first summarize</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.340" end="01:25:18.050" style="s2">respectfully the argument that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.660" end="01:25:19.790" style="s2">just heard right and I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.050" end="01:25:23.660" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fantastic starting point</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.790" end="01:25:24.230" style="s2">just for a start you much less likely to</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.660" end="01:25:26.030" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.230" end="01:25:27.620" style="s2">angrily if your first having to take</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.030" end="01:25:29.420" style="s2">that time to do that right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.620" end="01:25:30.620" style="s2">happy to consider properly what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.420" end="01:25:31.310" style="s2">saying I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.620" end="01:25:33.680" style="s2">lovely idea</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.310" end="01:25:35.239" style="s2">he may not ride it well and that goes to</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.680" end="01:25:37.040" style="s2">what we were saying earlier to about</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.239" end="01:25:39.700" style="s2">making sure that we&#39;re operating with</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.040" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">the same definitions and yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.700" end="01:25:44.750" style="s2">absolutely absolutely yes it&#39;s all set</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:46.730" style="s2">out and he made another point as well I</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.750" end="01:25:49.850" style="s2">can&#39;t think what it was no it was a long</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.730" end="01:25:52.820" style="s2">similar lines but also I think important</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.850" end="01:25:54.710" style="s2">important to game be yeah so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.820" end="01:25:57.290" style="s2">well so right so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.710" end="01:26:00.890" style="s2">actually like there&#39;s two domains or</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.290" end="01:26:02.150" style="s2">levels you know on which we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.890" end="01:26:06.040" style="s2">about here because you know on that</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.150" end="01:26:10.580" style="s2">level that&#39;s like an interpersonal level</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.040" end="01:26:15.170" style="s2">where I&#39;m learning new ways to interact</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.580" end="01:26:17.600" style="s2">and to you know be with other people</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.170" end="01:26:19.190" style="s2">right yeah and there&#39;s and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.600" end="01:26:23.030" style="s2">there&#39;s I just think there&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.190" end="01:26:24.920" style="s2">to be some kind of institutional you</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.030" end="01:26:29.530" style="s2">know level as well like I mean I just</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.920" end="01:26:32.770" style="s2">don&#39;t see it happening in and of itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.530" end="01:26:35.510" style="s2">you know in groups of people like this I</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.770" end="01:26:38.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know and maybe I&#39;m wrong I know</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.510" end="01:26:42.620" style="s2">you mean but I also I also feel equally</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.330" end="01:26:45.280" style="s2">that it can&#39;t possibly happen top-down</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.620" end="01:26:48.770" style="s2">from the institutional level either I</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.280" end="01:26:52.810" style="s2">mean there&#39;s no impetus for them to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.770" end="01:26:52.810" style="s2">that there&#39;s no no I understand that</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.460" end="01:27:01.450" style="s2">well but the idea would be that if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.770" end="01:27:04.340" style="s2">know if we were to you know somehow</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.450" end="01:27:06.710" style="s2">change our politics in such a way that</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.340" end="01:27:09.700" style="s2">like let&#39;s say for example well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.710" end="01:27:12.820" style="s2">say for example something as simple as</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.700" end="01:27:15.830" style="s2">you know you want to start a company</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.820" end="01:27:18.920" style="s2">okay you&#39;ve got an idea you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.830" end="01:27:20.840" style="s2">make some widgets and every and and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.920" end="01:27:24.170" style="s2">you then you&#39;re gonna incorporate right</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.840" end="01:27:25.940" style="s2">and so at that point what if the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.170" end="01:27:28.670" style="s2">government says okay we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.940" end="01:27:30.739" style="s2">actually incentivize you turning this</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.670" end="01:27:33.209" style="s2">corporation into something like a</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.739" end="01:27:35.489" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.209" end="01:27:37.170" style="s2">right and so in some way we provide an</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.489" end="01:27:38.729" style="s2">incentive to you as a you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.170" end="01:27:40.530" style="s2">entrepreneur or whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.729" end="01:27:41.939" style="s2">call yourself we provide you an</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.530" end="01:27:47.039" style="s2">incentive that makes it more attractive</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.939" end="01:27:50.159" style="s2">for you to create a co-op than to create</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.039" end="01:27:52.439" style="s2">a corporation and that&#39;s great and this</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.159" end="01:27:54.599" style="s2">kind of thing is fantastic but how do we</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.439" end="01:27:58.170" style="s2">get governments to start implementing</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.599" end="01:28:03.479" style="s2">policies along those lines I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.170" end="01:28:05.550" style="s2">no electron sander I don&#39;t know not that</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.479" end="01:28:07.530" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t because his loads of ideas</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.550" end="01:28:10.199" style="s2">like that which would absolutely be</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.530" end="01:28:14.340" style="s2">steps on the road to a but I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.199" end="01:28:15.989" style="s2">any way of leveraging pressure on our</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.340" end="01:28:17.519" style="s2">elected officials given that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.989" end="01:28:19.739" style="s2">been bought and paid for a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.519" end="01:28:21.659" style="s2">I mean I think most people understand</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.739" end="01:28:23.969" style="s2">this now this is no longer conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.659" end="01:28:26.130" style="s2">theory right most people absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.969" end="01:28:27.449" style="s2">accept this as a fact of nature now but</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.130" end="01:28:29.489" style="s2">lobbyists and campaign and campaign</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.449" end="01:28:33.420" style="s2">contributors essentially control</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.489" end="01:28:37.519" style="s2">political agendas right yep so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.420" end="01:28:40.979" style="s2">don&#39;t see until legislation like</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.519" end="01:28:42.599" style="s2">citizens united and Buckley versus Valeo</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.979" end="01:28:45.689" style="s2">and I mean so this kind of stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.599" end="01:28:47.849" style="s2">repealed and you know corporate and and</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.689" end="01:28:50.249" style="s2">wealthy interests are no longer allowed</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.849" end="01:28:52.530" style="s2">to find companies I mean for fuck&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.249" end="01:28:54.900" style="s2">they spent over a billion dollars on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.530" end="01:28:59.099" style="s2">last presidential campaign a billion</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.900" end="01:29:01.110" style="s2">dollars it&#39;s just nuts it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.099" end="01:29:03.329" style="s2">fucking nuts it&#39;s an advertising and</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.110" end="01:29:06.510" style="s2">marketing campaign how is that got</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.329" end="01:29:08.309" style="s2">anything to do with you know sensible</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.510" end="01:29:10.289" style="s2">policies by which the road by which to</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.309" end="01:29:12.599" style="s2">run a country you know it&#39;s got the two</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.289" end="01:29:13.889" style="s2">things are no longer even pretending to</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.599" end="01:29:16.860" style="s2">be connected to each other anymore</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.889" end="01:29:19.439" style="s2">they&#39;re not even pretend me Congress no</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.860" end="01:29:20.939" style="s2">longer really even there&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.439" end="01:29:21.959" style="s2">pretending to write there they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.939" end="01:29:23.699" style="s2">pretend to represent their constituents</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.959" end="01:29:25.590" style="s2">for the most part I mean there are a</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.699" end="01:29:28.199" style="s2">couple of exceptions right but for the</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.590" end="01:29:30.570" style="s2">most part congressmen and Senators well</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.199" end="01:29:33.420" style="s2">yeah well let me but so so here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.570" end="01:29:36.329" style="s2">I would maybe I mean I&#39;m you know again</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.420" end="01:29:38.610" style="s2">it remains to be seen where this goes</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.329" end="01:29:41.039" style="s2">but you know in the States we have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.610" end="01:29:43.889" style="s2">real you know there&#39;s a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.039" end="01:29:46.250" style="s2">around you know the candidacy say of</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.889" end="01:29:48.910" style="s2">Bernie Sanders and</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.250" end="01:29:50.810" style="s2">the fact that the Energy&#39;s there is just</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.910" end="01:29:54.469" style="s2">encouraging to me now</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.810" end="01:29:56.719" style="s2">whether or not you know he he gets the</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.469" end="01:29:58.820" style="s2">nomination or he wins the presidency or</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.719" end="01:30:03.770" style="s2">even if he wins whether or not he&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.820" end="01:30:05.750" style="s2">to you know do anything it&#39;s like here</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.770" end="01:30:09.699" style="s2">is at least a person who has been</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.750" end="01:30:13.280" style="s2">staunch in his you know disdain for</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.699" end="01:30:16.239" style="s2">money and politics and you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.280" end="01:30:20.000" style="s2">top-heavy whatever whatever you know for</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.239" end="01:30:23.449" style="s2">decades you know has not just come to</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.000" end="01:30:27.160" style="s2">this you know these positions for the</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.449" end="01:30:29.210" style="s2">sake of political expediency you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.160" end="01:30:32.750" style="s2">when he started talking about these</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.210" end="01:30:34.190" style="s2">things right yeah so this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.750" end="01:30:38.390" style="s2">bad word in the u.s. I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.190" end="01:30:40.130" style="s2">understand why I know it&#39;s crazy but I</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.390" end="01:30:41.900" style="s2">tell you what excites me even more than</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.130" end="01:30:44.600" style="s2">Bernie Sanders because he&#39;s what he&#39;s 78</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.900" end="01:30:46.280" style="s2">or something yeah he&#39;s an old guy he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.600" end="01:30:49.130" style="s2">an old guy I mean not that I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.280" end="01:30:51.949" style="s2">anything against old per se but there</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.130" end="01:30:53.510" style="s2">comes a time when you know your job it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.949" end="01:30:55.730" style="s2">a big job anyway whatever that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.510" end="01:30:57.110" style="s2">side what excites me more in American</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.730" end="01:31:00.830" style="s2">politics at the moment I talked about it</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.110" end="01:31:03.290" style="s2">a bit on the discord was that Alexandria</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.830" end="01:31:06.739" style="s2">or Cassio Cortes and and that whole</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.290" end="01:31:08.270" style="s2">movement of grassroots support not using</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.739" end="01:31:10.780" style="s2">huge amounts of money yeah they collect</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.270" end="01:31:13.430" style="s2">contributions but it&#39;s mostly about</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.780" end="01:31:15.230" style="s2">grassroots action and knocking on doors</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.430" end="01:31:17.300" style="s2">and having little meetings in town</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.230" end="01:31:19.670" style="s2">centers and balls and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.300" end="01:31:21.830" style="s2">you know what I mean and this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.670" end="01:31:23.739" style="s2">where I think real change can come from</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.830" end="01:31:27.800" style="s2">is if a movement like that can snowball</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.739" end="01:31:30.290" style="s2">but once it does snowball it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.800" end="01:31:33.770" style="s2">victim I reckon to all the same power</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.290" end="01:31:36.320" style="s2">dynamics that the existing power so</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.770" end="01:31:39.020" style="s2">there it is right but that that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.320" end="01:31:42.500" style="s2">that&#39;s where maybe game B can really</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.020" end="01:31:47.449" style="s2">play a role right because if we can you</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.500" end="01:31:50.150" style="s2">know if if we can manage to call that</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.449" end="01:31:52.670" style="s2">what it is when we see it happening now</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.150" end="01:31:55.670" style="s2">again you&#39;re right the thing has a power</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.670" end="01:31:58.400" style="s2">and an inertia of its own you know and</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.670" end="01:31:59.959" style="s2">the military-industrial complex is not</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.400" end="01:32:02.749" style="s2">going to go away</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.959" end="01:32:06.789" style="s2">without fight for sure it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.749" end="01:32:10.070" style="s2">they&#39;ve got all the guns right exactly a</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.789" end="01:32:14.329" style="s2">lot of pain and suffering behind if it</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.070" end="01:32:15.829" style="s2">goes away you know but it&#39;s like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.329" end="01:32:18.829" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve all got to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.829" end="01:32:20.780" style="s2">work together to call out the bullshit</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.829" end="01:32:23.030" style="s2">and so if it ends up that you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.780" end="01:32:26.360" style="s2">people get corrupted again I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.030" end="01:32:28.159" style="s2">why there is legislation you know to get</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.360" end="01:32:30.439" style="s2">money out of politics for the most part</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.159" end="01:32:33.679" style="s2">or in in a pretty significant way but</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.439" end="01:32:41.239" style="s2">you know you just you can&#39;t get anything</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.679" end="01:32:43.909" style="s2">done that&#39;s right and even even the</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.239" end="01:32:46.489" style="s2">House of Representatives as a whole has</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.909" end="01:32:47.989" style="s2">some legislation on the table but they</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.489" end="01:32:49.969" style="s2">can&#39;t they won&#39;t be able to get it</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.989" end="01:32:51.590" style="s2">through the Senate you know and so it</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.969" end="01:32:53.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter at this point</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.590" end="01:32:59.119" style="s2">yeah and they certainly won&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.119" end="01:33:01.880" style="s2">boss the president right so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.119" end="01:33:05.420" style="s2">it&#39;ll be interesting to watch but it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.880" end="01:33:08.659" style="s2">it&#39;s frustrating you know as a like as a</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.420" end="01:33:11.959" style="s2">parent of a ten year old you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.659" end="01:33:14.389" style="s2">really sometimes just depressing to</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.959" end="01:33:17.019" style="s2">think that we&#39;re gonna have to you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.389" end="01:33:17.019" style="s2">live through</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.199" end="01:33:22.389" style="s2">couple generations of like chaos in</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.570" end="01:33:23.880" style="s2">order to get to the other side so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.389" end="01:33:26.340" style="s2">interested in what you were saying about</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.880" end="01:33:29.920" style="s2">somehow or other getting game be</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.340" end="01:33:32.019" style="s2">incorporated into say for example what</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.920" end="01:33:33.489" style="s2">are they called again the citizens you</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.019" end="01:33:35.380" style="s2">know they&#39;re not citizens united what</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.489" end="01:33:39.519" style="s2">are they called again this so jump it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.380" end="01:33:42.070" style="s2">Democrats so it was justice Democrats</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.519" end="01:33:43.719" style="s2">House Democrats yes so you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.070" end="01:33:45.940" style="s2">say this justice Democrats movement</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.719" end="01:33:48.190" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you know Jordan and Jamie</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.940" end="01:33:49.599" style="s2">and Daniel could get in there and start</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.190" end="01:33:52.269" style="s2">talking to these guys and you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.599" end="01:33:53.829" style="s2">getting them involved in sessions you</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.269" end="01:33:55.389" style="s2">know trying to achieve coherence or at</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.829" end="01:33:58.179" style="s2">least getting the principles of what</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.389" end="01:34:02.739" style="s2">coherence is all about across to them</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.179" end="01:34:05.829" style="s2">and and so on I like that idea talk more</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.739" end="01:34:08.769" style="s2">I like that idea has evolved in these</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.829" end="01:34:12.190" style="s2">movements yeah I I don&#39;t know you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.769" end="01:34:15.369" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s on a level of you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.190" end="01:34:17.559" style="s2">organization that I have no access to</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.369" end="01:34:20.889" style="s2">you I guess you know it would take some</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.559" end="01:34:22.719" style="s2">you know it would takes getting involved</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.889" end="01:34:24.670" style="s2">with you know say the rebel wisdom guys</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.719" end="01:34:26.979" style="s2">or somebody who has access to those</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.670" end="01:34:28.329" style="s2">people you know context man I mean</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.979" end="01:34:32.800" style="s2">Jamie&#39;s worked with some pretty</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.329" end="01:34:35.229" style="s2">highfalutin people well I mean he&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.800" end="01:34:38.739" style="s2">know he obviously went to you know these</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.229" end="01:34:42.699" style="s2">conferences in an attempt to you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.739" end="01:34:44.800" style="s2">solve things like global war you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.699" end="01:34:46.209" style="s2">see something about the oceans right</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.800" end="01:34:48.519" style="s2">there was something he was involved in</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.209" end="01:34:50.559" style="s2">and he said he got down there and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.519" end="01:34:53.229" style="s2">thing got derailed by you know somebody</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.559" end="01:34:59.769" style="s2">getting triggered over right there sir</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.229" end="01:35:02.769" style="s2">or gender or something you know mr. fry</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.769" end="01:35:07.389" style="s2">man then your own personal you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.769" end="01:35:10.449" style="s2">misgivings oh yeah so obviously when you</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.389" end="01:35:13.809" style="s2">get these people into those places it</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.449" end="01:35:15.699" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always go well to do so people</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.809" end="01:35:18.699" style="s2">out there can you actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.699" end="01:35:21.880" style="s2">sensible discussion about climate change</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.699" end="01:35:24.360" style="s2">or gender politics or politics of any</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.880" end="01:35:28.749" style="s2">kind actually come to that without it</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.360" end="01:35:30.940" style="s2">likely becoming bitter and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.749" end="01:35:34.060" style="s2">there&#39;s just so few people</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.940" end="01:35:36.040" style="s2">that aren&#39;t ideologically and</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.060" end="01:35:39.910" style="s2">emotionally invested in something in</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.040" end="01:35:41.969" style="s2">something or rather to something with</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.910" end="01:35:46.719" style="s2">this with this identity politics and</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.969" end="01:35:48.940" style="s2">yeah but you know I think it&#39;s less I</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.719" end="01:35:53.469" style="s2">think identity politics is just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.940" end="01:35:58.830" style="s2">a symptom of you know a deeper problem</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.469" end="01:36:03.790" style="s2">which is like I feel so disconnected to</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.830" end="01:36:05.860" style="s2">you know the world and to humanity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.790" end="01:36:09.250" style="s2">like that&#39;s why I think you know stuff</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.860" end="01:36:11.890" style="s2">like Buddhism and you know that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.250" end="01:36:14.199" style="s2">training exposure to that is so</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.890" end="01:36:18.190" style="s2">important to me because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.199" end="01:36:21.340" style="s2">without having some sense that like we</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.190" end="01:36:24.160" style="s2">are all one yeah you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.340" end="01:36:27.400" style="s2">yeah like how you you know that is so</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.160" end="01:36:32.070" style="s2">fundamental to everything that I do is</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.400" end="01:36:35.890" style="s2">this constant you know returning to that</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.070" end="01:36:37.270" style="s2">insight and it just but as you go about</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.890" end="01:36:39.880" style="s2">doing that what what happened what</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.270" end="01:36:42.760" style="s2">practices do you do to return to that</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.880" end="01:36:45.400" style="s2">insight oh well I mean it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.760" end="01:36:47.890" style="s2">like you did you were you showing me</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.400" end="01:36:57.489" style="s2">that there&#39;s that Jamie wheel video</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.890" end="01:36:59.980" style="s2">about something about coherence but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.489" end="01:37:02.140" style="s2">super excited about his new book that</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.980" end="01:37:04.480" style="s2">he&#39;s working on right because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.140" end="01:37:07.060" style="s2">talking about these kinds of things and</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.480" end="01:37:11.199" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about storming like breath</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.060" end="01:37:15.040" style="s2">is the the primary to me you know breath</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.199" end="01:37:18.460" style="s2">work being able to sit and do I mean</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.040" end="01:37:20.800" style="s2">something like Vipassana meditation is I</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.460" end="01:37:22.590" style="s2">mean like you get to a point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.800" end="01:37:25.989" style="s2">not like you&#39;re having some kind of I</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.590" end="01:37:28.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know it just you you get to a</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.989" end="01:37:34.510" style="s2">point where there&#39;s enough stillness</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.500" end="01:37:37.650" style="s2">that you know divisions start to fall</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.510" end="01:37:40.989" style="s2">away and you know you&#39;re you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.650" end="01:37:43.480" style="s2">physiologically changing you know how</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.989" end="01:37:44.949" style="s2">reactive you are to things and how</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.480" end="01:37:48.399" style="s2">personally you take the</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.949" end="01:37:51.820" style="s2">and you know and then I mean a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.399" end="01:37:53.679" style="s2">just comes down to you know having done</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.820" end="01:37:55.030" style="s2">that work for a long time you just sort</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.679" end="01:37:57.699" style="s2">of start to internalize it you know you</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.030" end="01:37:59.889" style="s2">were talking about what happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.699" end="01:38:01.989" style="s2">try to seek coherence more and more</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.889" end="01:38:03.219" style="s2">often it doesn&#39;t become easier and again</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.989" end="01:38:05.699" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know that it comes becomes</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.219" end="01:38:10.229" style="s2">easier but I think you get better at it</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.699" end="01:38:13.269" style="s2">and you have more direct access to it</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.229" end="01:38:15.280" style="s2">but I mean that like everything you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.269" end="01:38:16.510" style="s2">I started looking at Buddhism when I was</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.280" end="01:38:18.999" style="s2">like in high school you know when I</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.510" end="01:38:21.550" style="s2">first started coming out of you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.999" end="01:38:25.119" style="s2">kind of the rote Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.550" end="01:38:26.649" style="s2">that I was raised in you know in high</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.119" end="01:38:28.749" style="s2">school I started asking questions and</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.649" end="01:38:32.320" style="s2">stuff and you know started looking at</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.749" end="01:38:34.869" style="s2">Zen and Taoism and stuff like that and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.320" end="01:38:39.519" style="s2">mean I just think that stuff is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.869" end="01:38:41.229" style="s2">critical to understanding that you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.519" end="01:38:42.610" style="s2">we&#39;re all in this together kind of and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.229" end="01:38:44.289" style="s2">mean I you can get to it other ways I</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.610" end="01:38:45.969" style="s2">mean I heard they were talking about how</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.289" end="01:38:48.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh you know a lot of times</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.969" end="01:38:51.399" style="s2">astronauts have a similar yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.570" end="01:38:53.739" style="s2">orientation yeah you know because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.399" end="01:38:57.030" style="s2">just when you get to that place and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.739" end="01:38:59.079" style="s2">actually look back it&#39;s like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.030" end="01:39:01.419" style="s2">see it any other way anymore</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.079" end="01:39:03.550" style="s2">you know and so I all those lines you</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.419" end="01:39:05.229" style="s2">have in your head are going yeah all</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.550" end="01:39:09.189" style="s2">right they&#39;re all arbitrary in there</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.229" end="01:39:10.840" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah it must be it must be a</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.189" end="01:39:14.079" style="s2">pretty profound experience it really</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.840" end="01:39:16.809" style="s2">must yeah I mean so to me it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.079" end="01:39:18.699" style="s2">know there&#39;s got to be I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.809" end="01:39:20.139" style="s2">you&#39;re just you know and then it goes</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.699" end="01:39:22.389" style="s2">back to what we were talking about with</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.139" end="01:39:25.689" style="s2">trying to integrate the game be stuff</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.389" end="01:39:27.669" style="s2">somehow and it seems like that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.689" end="01:39:31.449" style="s2">really difficult to do because people</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.669" end="01:39:32.949" style="s2">just aren&#39;t on that page you know but</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.449" end="01:39:37.860" style="s2">you would think that these justice</p>

<p begin="01:41:58.079" end="01:42:04.420" style="s2">what&#39;s that did we achieve coherence or</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.199" end="01:42:06.969" style="s2">well yeah I mean I would say that we</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.420" end="01:42:12.230" style="s2">were able to you know now did we come up</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.969" end="01:42:14.180" style="s2">with some you know new was there an and</p>

<p begin="01:42:14.180" end="01:42:18.980" style="s2">guarantee that yeah we definitely were</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.580" end="01:42:21.590" style="s2">able to kind of hold things hold two</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.980" end="01:42:25.820" style="s2">things together and and work together to</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.590" end="01:42:27.320" style="s2">try and locate the signal amongst the</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.820" end="01:42:31.489" style="s2">noise which i think is what it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.320" end="01:42:33.440" style="s2">all the one original thought I had or at</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.489" end="01:42:35.239" style="s2">least it felt original I don&#39;t recall</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.440" end="01:42:36.650" style="s2">having heard it already anywhere else</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.239" end="01:42:41.140" style="s2">although I may have done you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.650" end="01:42:43.520" style="s2">mean was the thing about technology</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.140" end="01:42:46.670" style="s2">supporting the biological organism up</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.520" end="01:42:48.560" style="s2">until recently that&#39;s that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.670" end="01:42:50.180" style="s2">something I think perhaps I might never</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.560" end="01:42:52.400" style="s2">have come up with had it not been in the</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.180" end="01:42:54.470" style="s2">context of the conversation and you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.400" end="01:42:56.480" style="s2">the the relationship between what we</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.470" end="01:42:58.550" style="s2">were saying to each other it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.480" end="01:43:00.470" style="s2">it&#39;s possible it emerged that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.550" end="01:43:02.180" style="s2">possible to version something I did see</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.470" end="01:43:03.620" style="s2">or read and don&#39;t remember seeing or</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.180" end="01:43:06.290" style="s2">reading it so that&#39;s equally possible</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.620" end="01:43:10.850" style="s2">right but at least at least it plucks it</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.290" end="01:43:12.290" style="s2">out yeah yeah and so what we should do</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.850" end="01:43:14.300" style="s2">like I mean this would be cool to do</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.290" end="01:43:16.790" style="s2">this you know again sometime so we&#39;ll</p>
