<p begin="00:00:00.299" end="00:00:08.790" style="s2">the so hi everybody so we&#39;re just mid</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.960" end="00:00:11.490" style="s2">mid conversation we&#39;ve been talking for</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:16.139" style="s2">a couple of hours already but um we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.490" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">talking about philosophy and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.139" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2">O&#39;s and making this bridge between the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">personal and the philosophical like what</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.140" end="00:00:26.730" style="s2">what is that bridge right like and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:30.269" style="s2">because but most of the times like when</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.730" end="00:00:32.070" style="s2">you and I get on we I&#39;m like I do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.269" end="00:00:33.450" style="s2">like how are you doing you start talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.070" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">about whatever it is going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.450" end="00:00:37.739" style="s2">life and then and then I get interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">or you get interested and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.739" end="00:00:44.820" style="s2">describe it and then some new thing kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:46.649" style="s2">of opens up and then the what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.820" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">talking about all together for the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.649" end="00:00:52.620" style="s2">year starts to you start to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">into the phenomenological you start</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.620" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">describing that thing that just in your</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">concrete light in those terms and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">becomes so that&#39;s where time starts to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">disappear yeah it&#39;s kind of connection</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">between the like that these like</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">intensely high abstract I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:14.930" style="s2">highest levels of abstraction that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:19.560" style="s2">could imagine right in working those out</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.930" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">into your life like that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">connection that&#39;s made with that and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">I think that&#39;s actually the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">actually essential this is why</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">philosophy via maybe some it may be</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t just one option of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:39.409" style="s2">something we can do but like that if</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:44.040" style="s2">it&#39;s missing we become six in some way</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.409" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">great of this kind of I mean especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.040" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">now because it&#39;s like with with</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">everything flattening out so much right</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">no sense of real clear your key that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">seems viable for anybody um that holds</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:01:58.740" style="s2">any weight</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">it does seem it does seem like people</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.740" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">need to do they need to they need to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">the scaffolding and in in height the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">depth right themselves and we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">in that time I think that&#39;s the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">necessity that I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:20.280" style="s2">getting about wanting wanting people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">aren&#39;t have no interest in philosophy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.280" end="00:02:27.719" style="s2">start to ignite this fire because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.719" end="00:02:34.769" style="s2">that well well this is this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">was saying about this is like why that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.769" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">matters is because like you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:43.799" style="s2">if you can&#39;t if these conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:48.419" style="s2">what you&#39;re reading and doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.799" end="00:02:50.810" style="s2">difference in your actual life like then</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.419" end="00:02:53.340" style="s2">you&#39;re just doing something else right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.810" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like the point is is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:03:01.439" style="s2">get these things to to to get what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">what Hager is talking about what Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.439" end="00:03:07.079" style="s2">talking about what like these these</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">these people that just really like went</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.079" end="00:03:13.530" style="s2">into the depth of being and with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:16.709" style="s2">logos is that when you really get it you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.530" end="00:03:20.129" style="s2">actually the world shows itself to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.709" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">differently and all of your as Nora</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.129" end="00:03:24.510" style="s2">Bateson would say in her and your father</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:26.519" style="s2">would definitely say that like all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.510" end="00:03:30.930" style="s2">our actions are in correlation with our</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.519" end="00:03:35.069" style="s2">perception and philosophy for me has</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.930" end="00:03:37.560" style="s2">been an experience of when it when it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.069" end="00:03:40.919" style="s2">when it really is alive I turn around</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">and the same group of people there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.919" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">many more options available like with</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:47.729" style="s2">that same situation than before that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">because I can see more dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.729" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and thus I can start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:54.299" style="s2">respond to it and that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:55.470" style="s2">where I think it integrates and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.299" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">where there&#39;s almost no difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.470" end="00:04:02.849" style="s2">between philosophy and and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:07.169" style="s2">you live your life you can hold concrete</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.849" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely and I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.169" end="00:04:10.229" style="s2">been talking a lot about how this</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">process the dialogic process is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.229" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">sequenced and how it seems to naturally</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:20.299" style="s2">sequence itself when it&#39;s when it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">it becomes when it becomes autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.299" end="00:04:27.470" style="s2">and we were talking earlier one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">many threads we weave our converse</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:33.980" style="s2">to this point was about was about</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">warming up conversation and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.980" end="00:04:39.860" style="s2">me that the interpersonal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:42.110" style="s2">beginning with the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:43.940" style="s2">relationship that could otherwise under</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.110" end="00:04:46.430" style="s2">different circumstances lapse into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.940" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">therapeutic exercise that beginning with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.430" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">the interpersonal dynamic warms the air</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">of the conversation such that you then</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">become able to breathe it more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:04:58.190" style="s2">because then the marriage of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:01.960" style="s2">personal and the philosophic allows the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.190" end="00:05:05.750" style="s2">personal domains of experience to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.960" end="00:05:08.450" style="s2">analogized right to become analogues for</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.750" end="00:05:10.730" style="s2">the Ilocos that can then appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.450" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">levels of intelligibility right like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.730" end="00:05:15.200" style="s2">like the domains of personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">become analogic hosts for philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.200" end="00:05:19.610" style="s2">insight yeah so that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">few they&#39;re interfused right the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.610" end="00:05:24.470" style="s2">personal and the philosophic because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:28.030" style="s2">personal becomes the living analog for</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.470" end="00:05:30.770" style="s2">that that that makes the logos of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.030" end="00:05:33.620" style="s2">conversation into an implement for</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.770" end="00:05:35.510" style="s2">uncovering intelligibility right right</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.620" end="00:05:38.750" style="s2">and so then the analogize ation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.510" end="00:05:41.390" style="s2">personal personal experience becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.750" end="00:05:44.150" style="s2">kind of philosophic instrument to then</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.390" end="00:05:46.760" style="s2">play deeper and more resonant tunes if</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.150" end="00:05:49.190" style="s2">we&#39;re using that metaphor of musicality</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.760" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">for day logos right and so then it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.190" end="00:05:55.070" style="s2">becomes the body of rhythm that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:56.480" style="s2">that begins the philosophic gesture when</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.070" end="00:05:58.520" style="s2">that&#39;s why it comes back to it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.480" end="00:06:02.590" style="s2">repeatedly is because it continually</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.520" end="00:06:05.300" style="s2">uses that the analogy of that experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.590" end="00:06:08.419" style="s2">continually refocuses and retuns the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">conversation so that it doesn&#39;t drift</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.419" end="00:06:14.030" style="s2">away into abstraction and remains</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:16.550" style="s2">embodied huh and and and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.030" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">you know can can convert into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:24.830" style="s2">like an actionable wisdom yeah Oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.690" end="00:06:26.660" style="s2">totally because you&#39;re exercising you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.830" end="00:06:30.790" style="s2">know it&#39;s interesting because Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.660" end="00:06:35.210" style="s2">like the notion of time not as not as</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.790" end="00:06:39.289" style="s2">linear successions right but the time is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.210" end="00:06:40.930" style="s2">is timing right like the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.289" end="00:06:43.099" style="s2">opens up sites of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.930" end="00:06:45.469" style="s2">phenomena itself right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.099" end="00:06:49.370" style="s2">something that the phenomena is in its</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.469" end="00:06:54.139" style="s2">like way things time character of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.370" end="00:06:56.659" style="s2">which was I think Heidegger&#39;s key thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.139" end="00:06:59.240" style="s2">he brought to the conversation around it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.659" end="00:07:02.689" style="s2">that reveals all you know being in time</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.240" end="00:07:06.370" style="s2">and all that stuff but the but like if</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.689" end="00:07:11.659" style="s2">you think about that this how much of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.370" end="00:07:14.389" style="s2">your life is about timing right of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.659" end="00:07:16.580" style="s2">knowing knowing when to make a phone</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.389" end="00:07:20.090" style="s2">call and what way to make it with how</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.580" end="00:07:22.699" style="s2">much pressure like how what you should</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.090" end="00:07:24.680" style="s2">be doing at what point like what project</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.699" end="00:07:27.800" style="s2">to take on like how much time to spend</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.680" end="00:07:34.129" style="s2">here when I should do it like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.800" end="00:07:36.650" style="s2">it&#39;s very all the machinery that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.129" end="00:07:39.080" style="s2">presents you know in John&#39;s language</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.650" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">like the the agent and arena in the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.080" end="00:07:45.460" style="s2">that it occurs right I think is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:48.830" style="s2">something like dialog owes is like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.460" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">concentration of that right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.830" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">well because in conversation there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.279" style="s2">many opportunities there&#39;s so many like</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:58.250" style="s2">different openings that you could take</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.279" end="00:08:01.189" style="s2">and and you could become skilled at</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.250" end="00:08:03.439" style="s2">knowing that was not quite ready right</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.189" end="00:08:05.000" style="s2">and then and then letting it emerge</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.439" end="00:08:07.279" style="s2">somewhere else and then forgetting about</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.000" end="00:08:10.339" style="s2">it and then seeing it again and all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.279" end="00:08:13.610" style="s2">those sensibilities I think on one level</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.339" end="00:08:16.389" style="s2">is it&#39;s a it&#39;s an a TA race an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.610" end="00:08:18.469" style="s2">for I think the way we just</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.389" end="00:08:22.580" style="s2">phenomenologically conceive of our life</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.469" end="00:08:24.039" style="s2">and how we lived right well not how we</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.580" end="00:08:26.870" style="s2">conceive of it but how we</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.039" end="00:08:28.009" style="s2">phenomenologically comport it right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.870" end="00:08:31.399" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.009" end="00:08:33.380" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s right that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.399" end="00:08:38.269" style="s2">because then somehow like in having to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.380" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">speak like the logos and having to speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.269" end="00:08:44.540" style="s2">itself to thou and be heard by thou you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:46.459" style="s2">know something happens to the logos the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.540" end="00:08:48.620" style="s2">intelligible discourse right or</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.459" end="00:08:50.510" style="s2">intelligibility writ large how what at</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.620" end="00:08:52.069" style="s2">whatever level of resolution we figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.510" end="00:08:52.889" style="s2">the definition of logos that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.069" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">tough one</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.889" end="00:08:58.529" style="s2">Yeah right precisely because it can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:00.470" style="s2">so scaled that I&#39;d like at what level</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.529" end="00:09:03.389" style="s2">intelligibility do do we mean the term</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:05.489" style="s2">but but even at its most basic perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.389" end="00:09:08.309" style="s2">that is most at its most analogically</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.489" end="00:09:13.290" style="s2">minut at the level of basic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.309" end="00:09:18.059" style="s2">basic basic speech yeah that speech in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.290" end="00:09:22.410" style="s2">being spoken to our vow takes on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.059" end="00:09:26.489" style="s2">valence and meaning that supercedes is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.410" end="00:09:28.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a stance of content right and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.489" end="00:09:31.139" style="s2">think that the presence and witness of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.799" end="00:09:34.290" style="s2">vow allows for the logos of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.139" end="00:09:38.839" style="s2">intelligibility at the basic level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.290" end="00:09:41.639" style="s2">speech or discourse to then analogize</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.839" end="00:09:44.999" style="s2">intelligibility that is otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.639" end="00:09:47.429" style="s2">inaccessible so that embodied experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.999" end="00:09:50.249" style="s2">it&#39;s as though when spoken to thou the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.429" end="00:09:56.089" style="s2">syllables of speech become articulated</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.249" end="00:09:58.799" style="s2">such that the silence can can can emerge</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.089" end="00:10:01.079" style="s2">between them and that the silence that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.799" end="00:10:04.799" style="s2">emerges between the syllables as spoken</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.079" end="00:10:07.679" style="s2">to thou as heard by thou then every</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.799" end="00:10:10.410" style="s2">instance of logos every unit of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.679" end="00:10:14.429" style="s2">intelligible discourse becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.410" end="00:10:17.009" style="s2">analogy for its own insufficiency so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.429" end="00:10:18.600" style="s2">that the conversation seems to orient</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.009" end="00:10:21.089" style="s2">itself to deeper levels of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.600" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">intelligibility simply because it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.089" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">being spoken by the presence of a vow</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.660" style="s2">that hears it yeah right and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:35.610" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s how I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.660" end="00:10:37.289" style="s2">personal becomes becomes transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.610" end="00:10:40.049" style="s2">right I guess if we can put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.289" end="00:10:44.929" style="s2">is because in speaking of the personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.049" end="00:10:49.559" style="s2">we end up we end up embodying a gesture</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.929" end="00:10:53.819" style="s2">to what is ultimately beyond it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.559" end="00:10:57.899" style="s2">the level at which one learns what that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.819" end="00:11:01.589" style="s2">gesture exposes right the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.899" end="00:11:03.660" style="s2">intelligibility is so well if you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.589" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">about this is like imagine if I you were</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.660" end="00:11:09.630" style="s2">sitting by a fire right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">somebody came up right and set right</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.630" end="00:11:13.670" style="s2">next to you that you&#39;ve never met and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">you were silent for the whole hour</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.670" end="00:11:19.139" style="s2">imagine that and then imagine same</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:21.560" style="s2">situation person comes up that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.139" end="00:11:26.209" style="s2">never met and they they start by saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.560" end="00:11:31.980" style="s2">Amen that&#39;s a completely different hour</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.209" end="00:11:34.440" style="s2">yes right like that&#39;s but that kept like</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.980" end="00:11:37.290" style="s2">how to know to say that right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.440" end="00:11:40.529" style="s2">deduce in into propositional rules you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.290" end="00:11:42.899" style="s2">actually have to just like to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.529" end="00:11:45.449" style="s2">and go like be able to read whether or</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.899" end="00:11:49.199" style="s2">not like you were friendly or foe</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.449" end="00:11:51.089" style="s2">how much how far oh like distance to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.199" end="00:11:53.339" style="s2">a part whether to say anything whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.089" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">or not to say anything you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.339" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">like deduce that into some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:02.250" style="s2">mental understanding at all like it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:05.880" style="s2">much more because it&#39;s so complex it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.250" end="00:12:07.800" style="s2">so deep in one&#39;s being but it comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.880" end="00:12:10.889" style="s2">through I think all that all that kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.800" end="00:12:13.829" style="s2">of intelligibility that Lisa is also if</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.889" end="00:12:18.600" style="s2">language starts through mimicry yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.829" end="00:12:21.350" style="s2">right yes the role of mimicry and the K</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.600" end="00:12:26.300" style="s2">the cadence that you take on and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.350" end="00:12:26.300" style="s2">yeah do you think about this a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.779" end="00:12:41.819" style="s2">it&#39;s like I as I get older I noticed my</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.180" end="00:12:43.980" style="s2">father a lot more and I noticed myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.819" end="00:12:47.459" style="s2">saying stuff that I&#39;ve never heard him</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.980" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">say but he would say like and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.459" end="00:12:54.709" style="s2">something I can feel it like I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:58.980" style="s2">how what it is but there&#39;s some deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.709" end="00:13:00.990" style="s2">stylistic embodied thing that makes him</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.980" end="00:13:03.089" style="s2">a sense talking to me a sink stop that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">has to say that kind of joke in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.089" end="00:13:07.949" style="s2">kind of way that&#39;s probably like</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">connected to the Midwest that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.949" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">can&#39;t there&#39;s this but it how did how</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.370" end="00:13:16.319" style="s2">did it arise well look it arose through</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:20.279" style="s2">like being thrown into a world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.319" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">coping with it and style</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.279" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">and styles and contexts of contexts of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:30.810" style="s2">social interactions and embedded</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:34.499" style="s2">practices that go into that timing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.810" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">so so yeah just engaging and how we even</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.499" end="00:13:38.999" style="s2">engage in a conversation at all is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:41.339" style="s2">a bloody miracle I don&#39;t think anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.999" end="00:13:43.889" style="s2">could explain but like yeah start to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.339" end="00:13:46.110" style="s2">have conversations philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.889" end="00:13:49.879" style="s2">conversations at really high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.110" end="00:13:54.389" style="s2">abstraction but that are deeply personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.879" end="00:13:56.759" style="s2">right and that start to have a cadence</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.389" end="00:13:59.339" style="s2">of their own there&#39;s so much in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.759" end="00:14:02.550" style="s2">mimicking in the play of that cadence</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.339" end="00:14:04.319" style="s2">that I think is going on that&#39;s so so</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.550" end="00:14:10.050" style="s2">much deeper than the propositional level</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.319" end="00:14:15.420" style="s2">yes right yeah oh yeah absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.050" end="00:14:18.149" style="s2">that&#39;s even if what you&#39;re mimicking is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.420" end="00:14:21.389" style="s2">simply the silence of an auditing</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.149" end="00:14:24.180" style="s2">presence have you ever thought to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.389" end="00:14:25.740" style="s2">yourself like either inwardly or</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.180" end="00:14:27.899" style="s2">actually an outward conversation have</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.740" end="00:14:31.439" style="s2">you ever thought made a statement and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.899" end="00:14:34.709" style="s2">then cycled through I see a menu of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.439" end="00:14:37.980" style="s2">different listeners that could have</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.709" end="00:14:41.009" style="s2">changed the intimations of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.980" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">statement based on their presence right</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.009" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">but the same phrase as spoken to guy is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:51.180" style="s2">a different phase as a different phrase</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:53.879" style="s2">as spoken to any any number of different</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.180" end="00:14:55.889" style="s2">friends or interlocutors and that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.879" end="00:14:58.860" style="s2">company the chosen company or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.889" end="00:15:02.009" style="s2">figured company of presence that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.860" end="00:15:06.870" style="s2">witness to hear the logos of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.009" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">particular unit of speech can affect the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.870" end="00:15:17.309" style="s2">opening in that speech that will allow</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:20.730" style="s2">it to bear its that will allow how it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.309" end="00:15:24.629" style="s2">bear its meaning in directions that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.730" end="00:15:26.939" style="s2">yet to be explored and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.629" end="00:15:29.639" style="s2">choice of interlocutor or the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.939" end="00:15:32.670" style="s2">of the interlocutor becomes so important</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.639" end="00:15:34.580" style="s2">to inflect the logos with a particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.670" end="00:15:38.250" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.580" end="00:15:40.590" style="s2">in a particular direction right I so if</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.250" end="00:15:42.300" style="s2">I&#39;m you know if I say if I make a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.590" end="00:15:43.620" style="s2">statement and I say it to you it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.300" end="00:15:46.290" style="s2">different than I&#39;m if I make the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.620" end="00:15:50.400" style="s2">statement and say to my mother right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.290" end="00:15:55.110" style="s2">so and so then the the internalization</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.400" end="00:15:57.780" style="s2">of the avatar of guising stock into my</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.110" end="00:16:01.230" style="s2">interior via logos is very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.780" end="00:16:03.720" style="s2">because something said said to guy is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.230" end="00:16:09.660" style="s2">then inflected in such a way that it may</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.720" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">avail it may avail it may open a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.660" end="00:16:16.650" style="s2">typography of meaning in the interstices</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">of that logos statement that were not</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.650" end="00:16:23.160" style="s2">otherwise present to it or present to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:24.690" style="s2">right the silence of vow is something</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.160" end="00:16:26.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about right</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.690" end="00:16:28.230" style="s2">speaking into the science cuz I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.340" end="00:16:30.360" style="s2">thinking of it interiorly right we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.230" end="00:16:33.210" style="s2">talked a lot about exterior social deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.360" end="00:16:35.370" style="s2">logos in which now is like vow is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.210" end="00:16:38.670" style="s2">manifest I was there they&#39;re present</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.370" end="00:16:42.870" style="s2">they&#39;re listening but then but then a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:48.090" style="s2">vow of silence that allows a particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.870" end="00:16:50.610" style="s2">that allows the logos to resound right</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.090" end="00:16:53.280" style="s2">to resound and return to itself right</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:16:56.220" style="s2">it&#39;s as though in the silence it&#39;s truly</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.280" end="00:16:59.010" style="s2">laid bare yeah its capacity or</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.220" end="00:17:02.910" style="s2">possibility is truly laid bare as</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.010" end="00:17:05.070" style="s2">witnessed by the howl of silence and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.910" end="00:17:06.510" style="s2">importance of that silence so I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.070" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">were talking you talked about someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.510" end="00:17:11.490" style="s2">coming to sit beside you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:13.350" style="s2">staring into a campfire right think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.490" end="00:17:16.530" style="s2">how that silence use I mean you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.350" end="00:17:18.900" style="s2">silent it the conversation changes</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.530" end="00:17:21.270" style="s2">immeasurably depending on whether the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.900" end="00:17:23.040" style="s2">person comes and sits wordlessly with</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.270" end="00:17:27.480" style="s2">you or comes and sits and says hey man</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.040" end="00:17:30.120" style="s2">but it also the the what is intimated by</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.480" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">the silence before that fire also</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.120" end="00:17:33.900" style="s2">changes if someone comes and sits down</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:38.550" style="s2">and is there to witness it even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.900" end="00:17:41.130" style="s2">nothing is said mmm right yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.550" end="00:17:44.940" style="s2">the presence of silence and its role in</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.130" end="00:17:45.940" style="s2">deal logos is something I yeah I also</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.940" end="00:17:48.039" style="s2">find myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.940" end="00:17:49.990" style="s2">thinking about a lot and how what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.039" end="00:17:52.899" style="s2">really trying to do in some ways when</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.990" end="00:17:55.240" style="s2">we&#39;re dialoguing and silence is to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.899" end="00:17:59.009" style="s2">strange as it sounds is to actually try</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.240" end="00:18:06.460" style="s2">and presents the silence to presents its</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.009" end="00:18:12.389" style="s2">infinite depth in the spoken logos of of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.460" end="00:18:12.389" style="s2">discourse right but perfect silence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:22.090" style="s2">yeah what you&#39;re saying is just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.950" end="00:18:24.580" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really rich stuff I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.090" end="00:18:26.200" style="s2">thought about for a lot but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.580" end="00:18:30.490" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it in a way that&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.200" end="00:18:35.559" style="s2">me we figure we figure a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.490" end="00:18:37.720" style="s2">but like the thing about just well what</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.559" end="00:18:40.899" style="s2">one I mean I definitely noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.720" end="00:18:44.429" style="s2">that that who I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.899" end="00:18:47.710" style="s2">seems to be the locus of what I say like</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.429" end="00:18:51.909" style="s2">it&#39;s in fact it it doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.710" end="00:18:53.529" style="s2">sense if you think about well in order</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.909" end="00:18:54.909" style="s2">for it&#39;s kind of a chicken the egg</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.529" end="00:18:56.769" style="s2">problem but you can kind of get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.909" end="00:19:00.850" style="s2">logic of it of like well like how did</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.769" end="00:19:02.980" style="s2">speech arise right it seemed like it</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.850" end="00:19:06.340" style="s2">needed to be in response to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.980" end="00:19:08.200" style="s2">calling like a listener if there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.340" end="00:19:17.110" style="s2">a listener there couldn&#39;t be a speaker</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.200" end="00:19:20.019" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s like yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.110" end="00:19:26.289" style="s2">that thing about like listening yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.019" end="00:19:29.019" style="s2">listening because my my speech can have</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.289" end="00:19:31.419" style="s2">a listening attentiveness to it right</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.019" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">and then there is a quality I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.419" end="00:19:36.429" style="s2">oftentimes like in the in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:37.690" style="s2">dialogue OSes that we&#39;ve done like</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.429" end="00:19:40.210" style="s2">there&#39;s certain moments where you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.690" end="00:19:41.470" style="s2">just tell that you don&#39;t know no one</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.210" end="00:19:43.149" style="s2">really knows what they&#39;re gonna say but</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.470" end="00:19:45.389" style="s2">rather they&#39;re kind of like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.149" end="00:19:49.149" style="s2">quality of like you&#39;re hearing something</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.389" end="00:19:51.549" style="s2">right before they say say what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.149" end="00:19:54.340" style="s2">hearing but there&#39;s a listening or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.549" end="00:19:57.419" style="s2">tuning into something right and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.340" end="00:20:00.169" style="s2">thinking about that is the logos in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.419" end="00:20:06.869" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.169" end="00:20:09.210" style="s2">of listening I think really good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.869" end="00:20:12.570" style="s2">good yeah that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.210" end="00:20:15.659" style="s2">source of the communication is listening</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.570" end="00:20:18.779" style="s2">ready right right and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.659" end="00:20:22.139" style="s2">that happens in the logos whereby the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.779" end="00:20:26.580" style="s2">speaking voice in the listening ear can</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.139" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">join become become part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.580" end="00:20:30.869" style="s2">conjunctive identity alright we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.570" style="s2">talked about the emergence of the third</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.869" end="00:20:35.460" style="s2">factor the production of the Geist that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.570" end="00:20:37.710" style="s2">then turns to govern the relation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.460" end="00:20:40.139" style="s2">that the identities of the participants</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.710" end="00:20:41.669" style="s2">are outsourced they are offloaded to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.139" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">that emergent entity and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.669" end="00:20:45.389" style="s2">what in some sense what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:48.869" style="s2">there is the kind of telescoping</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.389" end="00:20:50.369" style="s2">together of the speaking voice the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.869" end="00:20:54.919" style="s2">speaking nine the listening vow that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.369" end="00:20:58.499" style="s2">become coextensive as part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.919" end="00:21:02.549" style="s2">the same entity of logos and that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.499" end="00:21:05.460" style="s2">becoming coextensive that&#39;s when the dia</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.549" end="00:21:07.229" style="s2">logos becomes properly autopoietic when</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.460" end="00:21:11.489" style="s2">the speaking voice in the listening year</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.229" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">are then conjoined and can auto-tune if</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.489" end="00:21:18.619" style="s2">I can use that metaphor right that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:20.969" style="s2">harmony then becomes it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.619" end="00:21:23.099" style="s2">self-organizing harmony precisely</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.969" end="00:21:26.129" style="s2">because we can now listen to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.099" end="00:21:28.979" style="s2">we can now be heard as though from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.129" end="00:21:31.859" style="s2">transcendent perspective within the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.979" end="00:21:33.989" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s imminent to us it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.859" end="00:21:35.969" style="s2">bridge right it&#39;s the symbol on its the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.989" end="00:21:38.339" style="s2">bridge that connects our speech that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.969" end="00:21:41.009" style="s2">connects the logos of speech to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.339" end="00:21:47.489" style="s2">logos in silence that has yet to bear</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.009" end="00:21:49.979" style="s2">its deeper intelligibility yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.489" end="00:21:52.710" style="s2">yeah who are we who like who is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.979" end="00:21:56.669" style="s2">listening who are we speaking to is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.710" end="00:22:00.419" style="s2">question that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.669" end="00:22:02.759" style="s2">really enigmatic question but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.419" end="00:22:05.519" style="s2">increasingly in my thinking at least it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.759" end="00:22:07.859" style="s2">takes on it takes on deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.519" end="00:22:10.440" style="s2">proportions yeah it&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.859" end="00:22:12.590" style="s2">coming back into this like little</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.590" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s so many levels going on in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:24.139" style="s2">what we&#39;re reading here right like and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:26.149" style="s2">think the diet the dynamic different</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.139" end="00:22:28.879" style="s2">interpretations about what Plato was</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.149" end="00:22:31.549" style="s2">doing and who sacrifice was and what all</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.879" end="00:22:36.649" style="s2">the dialogues meant the dynamic right</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.549" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">like a spousal of arguments and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.649" end="00:22:42.999" style="s2">conflicts and about what the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:46.580" style="s2">are I think kind of speak to this right</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.999" end="00:22:50.539" style="s2">but there&#39;s so much in the in in alkyl</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.580" end="00:22:54.860" style="s2">bodies that Socrates is demonstrating</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.539" end="00:22:58.220" style="s2">right while he&#39;s saying I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.860" end="00:23:02.059" style="s2">either right that there&#39;s so much going</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.220" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">on that&#39;s not he can&#39;t say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.059" end="00:23:10.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s almost as if</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:13.190" style="s2">the dialogue is is necessitating the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.220" end="00:23:16.369" style="s2">conditions I don&#39;t know the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.190" end="00:23:20.059" style="s2">that make something beyond what could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.369" end="00:23:22.220" style="s2">spoken heard but that&#39;s a commissioning</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.059" end="00:23:24.289" style="s2">to think is likely you know what is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.220" end="00:23:29.059" style="s2">that can only be known through it not</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.289" end="00:23:31.309" style="s2">being able to be said exactly sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.059" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">just kind of reading it this you called</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.309" end="00:23:35.509" style="s2">it last time I think I&#39;ve used this word</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">a lot it&#39;s like I just get the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.509" end="00:23:42.950" style="s2">review walked around this hollow hollow</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:44.149" style="s2">yeah yeah the irony - yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.950" end="00:23:47.299" style="s2">one again it&#39;s a way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.149" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">the irony and play the irony is that the</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:56.210" style="s2">dialogue and the irony of our speech in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.230" end="00:23:58.399" style="s2">this exact moment is that the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.210" end="00:24:00.649" style="s2">intelligibility the deepest logos of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.399" end="00:24:02.779" style="s2">speech is absent from our speech but its</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.649" end="00:24:05.240" style="s2">absence is precisely what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.779" end="00:24:08.269" style="s2">gesturing toward it&#39;s the silence</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.240" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">beneath the note of music it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:15.379" style="s2">that is actually the meaning of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.379" end="00:24:20.840" style="s2">because the speech has analogized the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.509" end="00:24:24.139" style="s2">presence of that silence just as every</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.940" end="00:24:30.490" style="s2">well right and that&#39;s the irony that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.420" end="00:24:32.740" style="s2">the irony whether cultivated or</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.490" end="00:24:36.340" style="s2">uncultivated witting or unwitting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.740" end="00:24:41.350" style="s2">the irony of dia logos irony is that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.340" end="00:24:44.470" style="s2">deepest intelligibility is yes is absent</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.350" end="00:24:46.900" style="s2">yeah from the logos of discourse and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.470" end="00:24:49.270" style="s2">logos of discourse the end the analogic</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.900" end="00:24:52.120" style="s2">function of the dialogue is to turn the</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.850" end="00:25:04.990" style="s2">feeble comparison to the logos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.010" end="00:25:09.010" style="s2">yet unrevealed yeah it&#39;s like that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.990" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">illumination right that necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.010" end="00:25:15.820" style="s2">withdrawals itself so that it can</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.820" end="00:25:22.150" style="s2">the what we&#39;re trying like what these I</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.410" end="00:25:23.710" style="s2">think the dialogues and philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.150" end="00:25:27.070" style="s2">trying to illuminate is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.710" end="00:25:28.630" style="s2">illumination right it&#39;s exactly and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.070" end="00:25:31.660" style="s2">one level you think about it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.630" end="00:25:33.460" style="s2">exalted thing right but actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.660" end="00:25:35.160" style="s2">talking about and know it&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.460" end="00:25:38.410" style="s2">talking about is the thing that like</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.160" end="00:25:41.490" style="s2">it&#39;s the intelligibility that everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.410" end="00:25:45.640" style="s2">normal in ordinary and everyday speaks</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.490" end="00:25:48.420" style="s2">already but the illumination in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.640" end="00:25:54.670" style="s2">you find that that that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.420" end="00:25:58.020" style="s2">intelligible necessarily hides in its</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.670" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">intelligibility yes there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.020" end="00:26:03.880" style="s2">to kind of see intelligibility itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:07.930" style="s2">which is I think you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.880" end="00:26:11.050" style="s2">I think Plato I think would say I know</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.930" end="00:26:14.470" style="s2">platonist talks about that he says the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.050" end="00:26:17.170" style="s2">big is intelligibility right like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.470" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">what being is it&#39;s it&#39;s yes it&#39;s that by</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.170" end="00:26:21.070" style="s2">virtue of which everything at all is</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:24.520" style="s2">anything that is all that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.070" end="00:26:25.690" style="s2">intelligible right so fricking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.520" end="00:26:28.450" style="s2">right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.690" end="00:26:29.860" style="s2">closure it&#39;s on one level like what why</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.450" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">is it it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.860" end="00:26:33.990" style="s2">it&#39;s so much about this is why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:36.520" style="s2">interesting being a human because</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.990" end="00:26:39.290" style="s2">there&#39;s so much there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.520" end="00:26:47.320" style="s2">potential that opens up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.290" end="00:26:52.940" style="s2">as far as I can tell anyways like beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.320" end="00:26:55.460" style="s2">like globs of stuff whether they be</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.940" end="00:26:58.280" style="s2">atoms or waves or any of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.460" end="00:26:59.660" style="s2">stuff kind of seems like I think I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.280" end="00:27:01.580" style="s2">get the sense that that doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.660" end="00:27:04.900" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t need you human beings at</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.580" end="00:27:09.500" style="s2">all to be there but the sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.900" end="00:27:13.070" style="s2">right at which the being of all those</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.500" end="00:27:16.220" style="s2">beings for it to be disclosed seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.070" end="00:27:18.650" style="s2">innately it&#39;s like it seemed it</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.220" end="00:27:22.510" style="s2">discloses as human but it does this</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.650" end="00:27:26.360" style="s2">trick show right where it&#39;s like so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.510" end="00:27:29.030" style="s2">so to be human is to be just fucking</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.360" end="00:27:31.640" style="s2">stupid at the same time and to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.030" end="00:27:34.309" style="s2">foolish and to be sure feels that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.640" end="00:27:37.669" style="s2">right and give me self-deceptive and not</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.309" end="00:27:40.730" style="s2">know it and like yeah like it&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.669" end="00:27:44.150" style="s2">folly right but there&#39;s this way there</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.730" end="00:27:47.809" style="s2">that that kind of our ability for</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.150" end="00:27:54.260" style="s2">absurdity and blindness is just</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.809" end="00:27:57.500" style="s2">absolutely atrocious yeah yeah right yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.260" end="00:28:00.169" style="s2">but whatever it is that allow that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.500" end="00:28:06.400" style="s2">allows for that level of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.169" end="00:28:09.110" style="s2">and folly right is also the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.400" end="00:28:10.160" style="s2">openness that allows for something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.110" end="00:28:14.150" style="s2">this to happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.160" end="00:28:16.460" style="s2">ray salutely absolutely because irony</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.150" end="00:28:18.860" style="s2">but in that you know that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.460" end="00:28:22.250" style="s2">because then when when the irony becomes</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.860" end="00:28:25.990" style="s2">a knowing irony rather than an unwitting</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.250" end="00:28:28.790" style="s2">irony when the joke becomes possessed</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.990" end="00:28:31.669" style="s2">when when we when we become knowingly</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.790" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">possessed of the joke yeah or rather mmm</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.669" end="00:28:36.530" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite right when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.970" style="s2">pause when with our knowing we possess</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.530" end="00:28:40.010" style="s2">the joke of that irony</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.970" end="00:28:41.929" style="s2">instead of being unwittingly possessed</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.010" end="00:28:44.330" style="s2">by the joke of the irony yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.929" end="00:28:49.549" style="s2">being it&#39;s teller as opposed to being</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.330" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">it&#39;s but as it were then our gross</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.549" end="00:28:56.060" style="s2">ineptitudes and insufficiencies then</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:59.630" style="s2">knowledge eyes the more nests huh that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.060" end="00:29:02.420" style="s2">they lack right and then we get into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.630" end="00:29:05.180" style="s2">region I think that August and cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.420" end="00:29:08.890" style="s2">learned ignorant right which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.180" end="00:29:13.660" style="s2">appreciation of our ignorant becomes</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.890" end="00:29:13.660" style="s2">becomes the knowing gesture that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.200" end="00:29:19.670" style="s2">interrupts that ignorance with genuine</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.790" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">knowing or that turns that ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.670" end="00:29:25.670" style="s2">into a form of genuine knowing knowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:29.510" style="s2">being a process of disclosure the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.670" end="00:29:32.300" style="s2">process of alifair right that that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.510" end="00:29:34.970" style="s2">the knowing is the active on concealment</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.300" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">does not whatever it is that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.970" end="00:29:45.320" style="s2">unconcealed yeah yeah and and and for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">number of reasons some of which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.320" end="00:29:52.580" style="s2">just said dia logos this particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.270" end="00:29:56.150" style="s2">format this particular form of being in</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.580" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">relation seems to be a pronunciation &#39;l</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.150" end="00:30:02.170" style="s2">vessel for that learned ignorant in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:05.630" style="s2">way that very very few things are</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.170" end="00:30:09.380" style="s2">precisely because of the acute presence</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.630" end="00:30:10.700" style="s2">of the listening thou that here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.380" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">ignorance yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.700" end="00:30:16.520" style="s2">thou the listening thou here even if</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:19.190" style="s2">that listening Dow is interiorized and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.520" end="00:30:22.490" style="s2">imagined from a template in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.190" end="00:30:26.810" style="s2">world yeah the listening thou keenly</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.490" end="00:30:31.340" style="s2">aware hears ignorant senses ignorance in</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.810" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">a way that the in a way the blathering</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.340" end="00:30:37.130" style="s2">speech doesn&#39;t right the listening thou</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">here&#39;s this here&#39;s the ignorance within</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.130" end="00:30:42.710" style="s2">the speech and that&#39;s why the conjoining</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:46.550" style="s2">of the listening thou to the speaking I</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.710" end="00:30:50.330" style="s2">in the in this circularly any dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.550" end="00:30:53.330" style="s2">process becomes that mechanism for self</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.330" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">tuning precisely because we can then</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.330" end="00:30:58.100" style="s2">hear and begin to appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:01.389" style="s2">ignorance in the logos of our own speech</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.100" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">and and then possess it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.389" end="00:31:05.940" style="s2">rather than being possessed by it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:11.590" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.940" end="00:31:15.340" style="s2">this it&#39;s a that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.590" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">I&#39;ve never quite caught it like that so</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.340" end="00:31:30.519" style="s2">that the the listening now here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:35.830" style="s2">the ignorance or the or or in in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.519" end="00:31:40.779" style="s2">other or in the self the ignorance in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.830" end="00:31:43.080" style="s2">which it she uses itself within the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.779" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.080" end="00:31:47.109" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">what is it that like a it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.109" end="00:31:55.929" style="s2">interesting so what is ignorance to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">one that moves towards it in that way it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.929" end="00:32:01.179" style="s2">seems that it apprehends it&#39;s like it I</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:05.409" style="s2">get the sense it&#39;s like ignorant isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.179" end="00:32:07.149" style="s2">like the absence of knowledge right but</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.409" end="00:32:12.850" style="s2">it seems that there&#39;s a potential in</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.149" end="00:32:14.440" style="s2">ignorance that is something about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.850" end="00:32:18.869" style="s2">thing that you walk around the hollow</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.440" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">that you walk around right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.869" end="00:32:25.090" style="s2">yeah I see it seems like that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:27.789" style="s2">what&#39;s realized in the ignorance is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.090" end="00:32:30.299" style="s2">that the potential I&#39;m drawn towards in</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.789" end="00:32:34.239" style="s2">the other right is like a slope yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.299" end="00:32:37.539" style="s2">right yes yes and it&#39;s it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.239" end="00:32:40.629" style="s2">completion yeah it&#39;s in the incompletion</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.539" end="00:32:41.889" style="s2">of logos is sort of what I&#39;m when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.629" end="00:32:45.909" style="s2">think of ignorance I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.889" end="00:32:48.239" style="s2">incomplete logos and then because what</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.909" end="00:32:52.539" style="s2">the listening though does is thou</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.239" end="00:32:55.119" style="s2">consents and I use the silence as an</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.539" end="00:32:56.440" style="s2">analogy it&#39;s an embodied analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.119" end="00:32:59.379" style="s2">this but I find it a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.440" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">embodied analogy is that the listening</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.379" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">thou can hear all that is unsaid right</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:07.799" style="s2">by the logos everything that is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:13.509" style="s2">present everything that is incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.799" end="00:33:14.530" style="s2">yeah becomes becomes more apparent to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.509" end="00:33:20.350" style="s2">the listener</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.530" end="00:33:23.890" style="s2">hmm right listener hears everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.350" end="00:33:24.280" style="s2">not in a sense of precisely identifying</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.890" end="00:33:27.220" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.280" end="00:33:29.530" style="s2">but in appreciating its presence the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.220" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">listener hears all that is not manifest</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.530" end="00:33:35.080" style="s2">in the logos of speech</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:38.260" style="s2">everything the specter of everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.080" end="00:33:40.780" style="s2">that is outside of its boundaries yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:43.950" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it&#39;s that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.780" end="00:33:47.080" style="s2">about that distinction about something</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.950" end="00:33:51.040" style="s2">sensing something that&#39;s intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.080" end="00:33:53.050" style="s2">but not comprehensible right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.040" end="00:33:54.550" style="s2">well that&#39;s right there&#39;s this core core</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.050" end="00:33:56.020" style="s2">you you use that you use to turn a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.550" end="00:33:58.660" style="s2">phrase in it before we started recording</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.020" end="00:34:01.540" style="s2">that I loved which is its intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.660" end="00:34:02.620" style="s2">but inconceivable yes and conceive which</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.540" end="00:34:07.320" style="s2">I thought was great</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.620" end="00:34:09.370" style="s2">yeah and then in that like but in</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.320" end="00:34:10.810" style="s2">especially in the sense that we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.370" end="00:34:12.340" style="s2">actually talking about it right were</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.810" end="00:34:13.210" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about like a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.340" end="00:34:16.120" style="s2">and that you were like your</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.210" end="00:34:17.380" style="s2">retrospective like we were reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.120" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">what had just happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.380" end="00:34:25.390" style="s2">relationship that was really cool and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:32.590" style="s2">then there was a lot I watched you start</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.390" end="00:34:34.780" style="s2">to conceive of something that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.590" end="00:34:38.409" style="s2">intelligible that you were responding to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.780" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">in the musicality right retrospectively</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.409" end="00:34:43.090" style="s2">right right you conceived of it right</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:45.340" style="s2">but yet there was a way that it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.090" end="00:34:47.830" style="s2">present in an intelligible way in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.340" end="00:34:51.130" style="s2">musical way in a way that you found</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.830" end="00:34:53.169" style="s2">yourself inside out right without</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.130" end="00:34:55.179" style="s2">knowing in advance that that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.169" end="00:34:57.370" style="s2">were doing but in retrospect you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.179" end="00:35:00.040" style="s2">realized that you were in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.370" end="00:35:01.300" style="s2">with it right that&#39;s right so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.040" end="00:35:02.950" style="s2">kind of thinking about this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.300" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">just it never quite thought about</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.950" end="00:35:13.960" style="s2">ignorance right in in the way like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">logo yes the logos moves toward in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.960" end="00:35:17.830" style="s2">ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:19.510" style="s2">as a in a wick yeah just that it&#39;s a job</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.830" end="00:35:21.370" style="s2">through it&#39;s ignorant that the ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.510" end="00:35:23.350" style="s2">be no it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit of a it&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.370" end="00:35:24.910" style="s2">a mind bender it&#39;s like just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.350" end="00:35:27.810" style="s2">about it but it&#39;s as though the igner</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.910" end="00:35:31.970" style="s2">the insufficiency of logos what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.810" end="00:35:31.970" style="s2">otherwise call it&#39;s ignorant yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.390" end="00:35:36.270" style="s2">analogizes the morning</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.440" end="00:35:38.610" style="s2">that it has not been able to gather</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.270" end="00:35:44.310" style="s2">around right do you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.610" end="00:35:46.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like right yeah yes I and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.310" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">and I think of that in terms of a Wilf</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.080" end="00:35:52.200" style="s2">not willful is not quite right in terms</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:54.920" style="s2">of a knowing irony I&#39;m just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.200" end="00:35:57.360" style="s2">about so this is I think I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.920" end="00:36:03.810" style="s2">more and more of this when I teach</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.360" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">courses like and there is a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.810" end="00:36:08.100" style="s2">which there&#39;s a sense in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:10.740" style="s2">talking about this before where I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.100" end="00:36:12.750" style="s2">so much of like for example what it what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.740" end="00:36:18.120" style="s2">it means to be learn how to leave</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.750" end="00:36:21.060" style="s2">circles has it&#39;s so it&#39;s it it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.120" end="00:36:26.010" style="s2">it&#39;s got to come through through such an</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.060" end="00:36:28.230" style="s2">embodied sense right that there&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.010" end="00:36:30.840" style="s2">can&#39;t like literally give you a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:35.130" style="s2">step-by-step play-by-play that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.840" end="00:36:37.470" style="s2">learning it right but everyone wants to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.130" end="00:36:38.970" style="s2">understand it like that gets frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.470" end="00:36:41.940" style="s2">as they don&#39;t right and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.970" end="00:36:43.740" style="s2">turn up you know and and then I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.940" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">be sitting there just having just this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.740" end="00:36:50.340" style="s2">sense of like a knowingness it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:54.780" style="s2">like it&#39;s deeply attuned to them but</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.340" end="00:36:58.260" style="s2">also a sense of like just having gone</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.780" end="00:37:01.080" style="s2">through this so many times just aware of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.260" end="00:37:04.380" style="s2">the nonlinear like linear in this of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.080" end="00:37:07.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s a process and that like this</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.380" end="00:37:09.180" style="s2">all of that&#39;s necessary right no matter</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.620" end="00:37:11.100" style="s2">how much they&#39;re freaking out or</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.180" end="00:37:13.800" style="s2">frustrated or related or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.100" end="00:37:15.870" style="s2">right and and at some point they&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.800" end="00:37:18.450" style="s2">at me and they&#39;ll go like you you knew</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.870" end="00:37:20.190" style="s2">that all along right or you know like</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.450" end="00:37:22.590" style="s2">you know something you&#39;re not telling me</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.190" end="00:37:24.600" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting as I get what</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.590" end="00:37:27.300" style="s2">they&#39;re saying good I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.600" end="00:37:31.050" style="s2">know I don&#39;t there&#39;s nothing I could</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.300" end="00:37:34.380" style="s2">tell them yeah yeah don&#39;t be it great</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.050" end="00:37:36.060" style="s2">yeah alone right yeah that&#39;s right like</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.380" end="00:37:38.910" style="s2">I even don&#39;t even know what I know</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.060" end="00:37:41.640" style="s2">exactly but there&#39;s a way of holding it</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.910" end="00:37:45.299" style="s2">which i think is but you have a relation</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.640" end="00:37:47.490" style="s2">ship with the unknown yes for you there</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.299" end="00:37:50.490" style="s2">you have a you have a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.490" end="00:37:53.069" style="s2">the known unknowns yes that we might</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.490" end="00:37:56.940" style="s2">call faith incidentally right you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.069" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">continuity between your ignorant knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.940" end="00:38:04.529" style="s2">right and the unknowns right because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:07.559" style="s2">unknowns are present knowingly in your</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.529" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">particular disposition of ignorance yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.559" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:15.390" style="s2">ignorant is ironic because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:19.529" style="s2">ignorant is knowing of its insufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.390" end="00:38:22.230" style="s2">and presence presence is it right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.529" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s why people are making those</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.230" end="00:38:26.760" style="s2">accusations of you because they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:30.900" style="s2">and then and yet they&#39;re not right at</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.760" end="00:38:32.309" style="s2">the same time exactly exactly yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.900" end="00:38:40.019" style="s2">so interesting because I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.309" end="00:38:41.670" style="s2">that thing about it where it&#39;s from from</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.019" end="00:38:45.420" style="s2">some people&#39;s vantage point it looks</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.670" end="00:38:48.210" style="s2">like oh he&#39;s concealing something or</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.420" end="00:38:50.339" style="s2">there&#39;s something but actually there</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.210" end="00:38:52.019" style="s2">isn&#39;t anything there&#39;s just a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.339" end="00:38:53.460" style="s2">like yeah we&#39;re on the right track</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.019" end="00:38:55.500" style="s2">like he just seems like you&#39;re aiming in</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.460" end="00:38:59.400" style="s2">the right place and the lay up okay so</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.500" end="00:39:01.799" style="s2">you know yeah like you know your</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.400" end="00:39:03.089" style="s2">eyebrows are melting off but that&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.799" end="00:39:06.059" style="s2">never seen that before but I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.089" end="00:39:09.059" style="s2">that&#39;s normal to like just keep the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.059" end="00:39:13.079" style="s2">sense of like an unperturbed baldness</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.059" end="00:39:15.480" style="s2">about it&#39;s right over time right with me</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.079" end="00:39:19.319" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed oh right but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.480" end="00:39:22.970" style="s2">propositional but it is no no and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.319" end="00:39:25.109" style="s2">even eyes right so people yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.970" end="00:39:26.789" style="s2">keeping people people are there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.109" end="00:39:28.890" style="s2">there it&#39;s not as though you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.789" end="00:39:31.799" style="s2">concealing something it&#39;s simply that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.890" end="00:39:35.180" style="s2">you&#39;re appreciating the fact that much</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.799" end="00:39:40.950" style="s2">is still concealed yeah totally yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.180" end="00:39:42.630" style="s2">totally yes absolutely and you have you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.950" end="00:39:44.970" style="s2">have faith in its own concealment</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.630" end="00:39:47.339" style="s2">because you&#39;ve because you&#39;ve cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.970" end="00:39:49.589" style="s2">it because you&#39;ve practiced it you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.339" end="00:39:53.250" style="s2">practiced it&#39;s rhythms enough that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.589" end="00:39:55.079" style="s2">understand the pattern but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.250" end="00:39:56.969" style="s2">again that&#39;s your faith that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.079" end="00:39:58.829" style="s2">your cunt your the continuity of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.969" end="00:40:01.700" style="s2">identification with all that remains</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.829" end="00:40:04.559" style="s2">concealed from you and from your</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.700" end="00:40:06.809" style="s2">students at any given moment in time so</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.559" end="00:40:09.089" style="s2">what they&#39;re detecting as something you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.809" end="00:40:13.469" style="s2">are withholding is merely something you</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.089" end="00:40:15.059" style="s2">understand as withheld right right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.469" end="00:40:18.029" style="s2">funny I&#39;m just thinking about this I</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.059" end="00:40:22.339" style="s2">think is that is it is it Aristotle who</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.029" end="00:40:26.390" style="s2">talks about the virtue under all virtues</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.339" end="00:40:29.729" style="s2">like that all virtues requires courage</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.390" end="00:40:32.729" style="s2">hmm I think that&#39;s actually the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.729" end="00:40:35.789" style="s2">that I don&#39;t I&#39;m not aware of knowing at</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.729" end="00:40:39.239" style="s2">that time haha is there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.789" end="00:40:41.160" style="s2">like well like is a scary do you not</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.239" end="00:40:42.959" style="s2">know what you&#39;re doing it&#39;s like are you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.160" end="00:40:45.809" style="s2">getting it&#39;s like there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.959" end="00:40:48.569" style="s2">which I think that is that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.809" end="00:40:51.989" style="s2">disposition or what that&#39;s come to is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.569" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">through truly like myself in situation I</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.989" end="00:40:57.509" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m doing right</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">like yes yes and then it turns out my</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.509" end="00:41:04.739" style="s2">intuition was kind of on but opened up a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.650" end="00:41:08.130" style="s2">whole other world and then I had like</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.739" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">that whole enactment of aiming in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.130" end="00:41:13.170" style="s2">right place to be courageous at right</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:16.259" style="s2">now the Kairos of courage doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.170" end="00:41:18.329" style="s2">yeah right that no that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.259" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">really good point that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.329" end="00:41:25.769" style="s2">bringing courage into it in that way I</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:30.089" style="s2">guess that&#39;s because that also that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.769" end="00:41:33.749" style="s2">way of distinguishing virtue the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.089" end="00:41:37.589" style="s2">of courage and what we might otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.749" end="00:41:43.069" style="s2">call recklessness right because the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.589" end="00:41:47.299" style="s2">virtuous courage detects the Kairos in</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.069" end="00:41:47.299" style="s2">the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.620" end="00:42:03.510" style="s2">by virtue of action having having that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.810" end="00:42:06.810" style="s2">revelation take place in the throws of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.510" end="00:42:10.860" style="s2">the action taken right so that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.810" end="00:42:14.130" style="s2">courage the the courageous act has the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.860" end="00:42:17.220" style="s2">courageous act into its that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.130" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">resources the person currently lacks</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.220" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">whatever knowledge whatever knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:26.460" style="s2">person currently lacks will will I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:28.170" style="s2">to say likely but that sounds like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.460" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">a matter of probabilities and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.170" end="00:42:34.860" style="s2">what I mean but it that that that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:38.090" style="s2">that the knowing required to be equal to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.860" end="00:42:42.750" style="s2">the task emerges in the course of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.090" end="00:42:47.430" style="s2">undertaking it yeah and so the courage I</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.750" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">think is is in some sense preceded by</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:56.420" style="s2">some intuition that yeah that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.980" end="00:43:02.850" style="s2">ignorant action is nonetheless is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.420" end="00:43:05.070" style="s2">nonetheless a just one right like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.850" end="00:43:06.450" style="s2">because otherwise because otherwise the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.070" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">you know like if the act of courage is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.450" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">fruitless then yeah then it&#39;s I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">then what we&#39;re talking about is really</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:15.990" style="s2">the equilibrate of virtues not just the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:18.090" style="s2">virtue into itself I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.990" end="00:43:19.770" style="s2">something like you know courage like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.090" end="00:43:24.300" style="s2">four cardinal virtues together that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.770" end="00:43:26.340" style="s2">that that only only only concentred only</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.300" end="00:43:31.110" style="s2">cohered in relation to one another</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.340" end="00:43:33.120" style="s2">yeah do they constitute yeah proper</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.110" end="00:43:35.550" style="s2">virtue right his current courage</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.120" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">undertaken without the presence of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.550" end="00:43:41.310" style="s2">other virtues is tantamount to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:44.610" style="s2">foolishness and and I suppose that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.310" end="00:43:48.680" style="s2">they&#39;ll curried like that the courageous</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.610" end="00:43:51.840" style="s2">act the courageous ignorant is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.680" end="00:43:54.840" style="s2">undertaken with with a certain for</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.840" end="00:43:58.350" style="s2">knowing that the undertaking of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.840" end="00:44:01.650" style="s2">courageous act will yield yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.350" end="00:44:04.850" style="s2">disclosure of intelligibility required</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.650" end="00:44:04.850" style="s2">to make that act</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.289" end="00:44:15.149" style="s2">eh-eh-eh-eh will require - to affect</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.109" end="00:44:18.799" style="s2">something just or or or or wise you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.149" end="00:44:21.239" style="s2">and that for knowing in the ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.799" end="00:44:24.269" style="s2">like you&#39;re right they something about</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.239" end="00:44:27.449" style="s2">like something about that like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.269" end="00:44:30.449" style="s2">relationship of the logos to ignorant or</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.449" end="00:44:33.809" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not yet having completed</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.449" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">itself that just to bring that back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.809" end="00:44:45.749" style="s2">it as well of yeah it&#39;s interesting like</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:50.669" style="s2">what is it okay yeah cuz it does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.749" end="00:44:55.259" style="s2">me that it&#39;s courageous in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.669" end="00:44:57.929" style="s2">there was something like that I by</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.259" end="00:45:00.509" style="s2">virtue of not knowing how to do it not</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.929" end="00:45:02.399" style="s2">knowing exactly what it was not having</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.509" end="00:45:05.039" style="s2">it really really clear if I had all that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.399" end="00:45:06.689" style="s2">stuff right then it would to be courage</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.039" end="00:45:08.729" style="s2">she wouldn&#39;t take courage may take</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.689" end="00:45:11.669" style="s2">something else to do it right right</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.729" end="00:45:14.729" style="s2">exactly but precisely that it it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.669" end="00:45:17.969" style="s2">some glimmer on the horizon they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.729" end="00:45:19.769" style="s2">no okay like maybe that wasn&#39;t all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.969" end="00:45:22.889" style="s2">way on but there&#39;s something important</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.769" end="00:45:24.389" style="s2">here that we haven&#39;t named like we may</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.889" end="00:45:27.509" style="s2">have like blowing up eight thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.389" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">pounds and yeah yeah yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.509" end="00:45:33.299" style="s2">everywhere but like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.119" end="00:45:36.839" style="s2">there&#39;s something there that I write it</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.299" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">keep feeling itself that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.839" end="00:45:45.539" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting and then that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:48.479" style="s2">shaping of the shaping of the self in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.539" end="00:45:51.389" style="s2">relationship to that right yes on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.479" end="00:45:53.279" style="s2">disposition that&#39;s right yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.389" end="00:45:55.319" style="s2">right that&#39;s right because then the but</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.279" end="00:45:59.479" style="s2">the proleptic relationship you then have</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.319" end="00:46:05.939" style="s2">in that act to the aspect of self that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.479" end="00:46:07.739" style="s2">that exceeds you then than the that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.939" end="00:46:09.809" style="s2">understanding that and there&#39;s a I guess</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.739" end="00:46:12.899" style="s2">there&#39;s a realism a good reason why why</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.809" end="00:46:16.249" style="s2">Tillich associated faith with courage oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.899" end="00:46:16.249" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.280" end="00:46:27.170" style="s2">because then yeah because the the act of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.140" end="00:46:31.150" style="s2">faith the courage of the act of faith is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.170" end="00:46:38.770" style="s2">that kind of is the kind of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.150" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">consummation of one&#39;s own ignorance into</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.770" end="00:46:47.780" style="s2">the prolepsis of one&#39;s self that is ever</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.910" end="00:47:01.970" style="s2">hearing makes the most sense because you</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.930" end="00:48:30.390" style="s2">of reading well since this is what was</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:47.190" style="s2">being such a symbol for me of on so many</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:49.589" style="s2">levels how not to know right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.190" end="00:48:53.400" style="s2">well how not to know that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.589" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">right exactly right how not to have it</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.400" end="00:49:01.559" style="s2">all before you and like yeah but but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:04.200" style="s2">disposition to draw forth that happens</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.559" end="00:49:06.089" style="s2">and all the in this spot the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.200" end="00:49:08.150" style="s2">about the dialogue is so interesting as</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.089" end="00:49:12.930" style="s2">dialogues are the essence of spontaneity</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.150" end="00:49:15.420" style="s2">yeah right it&#39;s like it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.930" end="00:49:17.700" style="s2">just not there this is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.420" end="00:49:21.059" style="s2">people people are really surprised about</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.700" end="00:49:23.970" style="s2">like how much you can do in in zoo right</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.059" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">and how much of like a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.970" end="00:49:27.750" style="s2">connection that you could have when</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:30.809" style="s2">you&#39;re not there in person and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.750" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">that that displays the temporal</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.809" end="00:49:37.980" style="s2">dimension right that&#39;s at play in all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:41.279" style="s2">this right and at that timing the Kairat</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.980" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">ik sense of all those things that like</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.279" end="00:49:45.329" style="s2">it actually yeah yeah yeah because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:48.660" style="s2">temporality of the deal logos is</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.329" end="00:49:50.730" style="s2">continuous is is continuous with what is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.660" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">X temporal I think that&#39;s what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.730" end="00:49:54.809" style="s2">right I mean that&#39;s the guy Ross right</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">the opening of the Kairos is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.809" end="00:50:00.779" style="s2">is is the is the continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:03.450" style="s2">between between time and eternity right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.779" end="00:50:06.569" style="s2">it&#39;s that the point of that the point</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.450" end="00:50:10.170" style="s2">where they touch is precisely the cot ik</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.569" end="00:50:12.839" style="s2">opening and dialogue and that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.170" end="00:50:14.359" style="s2">one of the one of the the excellence of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.839" end="00:50:17.849" style="s2">dialogue goes is such that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.359" end="00:50:21.380" style="s2">reciprocally opens on that continuity</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.849" end="00:50:25.079" style="s2">between the temporal and the X temporal</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.380" end="00:50:25.370" style="s2">and allows us to retrieve and recover</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.020" end="00:50:57.710" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder that Socrates lapses into</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.610" end="00:51:00.340" style="s2">those famous trances right those famous</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.710" end="00:51:03.740" style="s2">reveries where he just stopped them goes</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.740" end="00:51:06.950" style="s2">of him that his interlocutors described</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.330" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">with him that he just stops and listens</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.950" end="00:51:13.370" style="s2">thinks he&#39;s just he&#39;s just hearing yeah</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.260" end="00:51:42.340" style="s2">have I have a guess</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.440" end="00:51:48.770" style="s2">I think it was 584 but I couldn&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.060" end="00:51:50.990" style="s2">you where on the page and I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.770" end="00:51:54.260" style="s2">100% sure that that&#39;s right I just know</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.990" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">that I had it bookmarked at that page so</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.260" end="00:51:58.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a good clue yeah so but I admit</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:04.030" style="s2">that I&#39;ve kind of lost the plot a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.820" end="00:52:07.160" style="s2">bit here okay I&#39;ll tell you what you be</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.030" end="00:52:11.540" style="s2">Socrates this time and then I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.160" end="00:52:18.740" style="s2">start on them okay let&#39;s stir it on at</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.540" end="00:52:24.410" style="s2">the top of 584 okay cool and now Kabaddi</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.740" end="00:52:26.660" style="s2">says to Socrates of course doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.410" end="00:52:29.390" style="s2">make both cities doesn&#39;t it make both</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.660" end="00:52:32.750" style="s2">cities and private citizens agree yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.390" end="00:52:35.960" style="s2">and isn&#39;t it the same with weighing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.750" end="00:52:37.850" style="s2">is well this agreement you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.960" end="00:52:39.230" style="s2">about what is it what&#39;s it about</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.850" end="00:52:41.930" style="s2">what skill</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.230" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">is it doesn&#39;t the same skill make both a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.930" end="00:52:47.270" style="s2">city and a private citizen agree both</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:51.050" style="s2">with themselves and with others that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.270" end="00:52:55.240" style="s2">does seem quite likely what is it then</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.050" end="00:52:57.890" style="s2">don&#39;t give up try your best to tell me I</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.240" end="00:52:59.000" style="s2">suppose I mean the sort of friendship</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.890" end="00:53:02.109" style="s2">and agreement</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.000" end="00:53:05.630" style="s2">you find when a mother and father agree</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.109" end="00:53:09.260" style="s2">with a son they love and when a brother</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.630" end="00:53:12.200" style="s2">agrees with his brother and a woman</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.260" end="00:53:14.060" style="s2">agrees with her husband actually what</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.200" end="00:53:15.950" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s that what are they</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.060" end="00:53:21.100" style="s2">talking about exactly what&#39;s the subject</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.950" end="00:53:21.100" style="s2">of the conversation if we go back here</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.390" end="00:53:26.900" style="s2">well then what about he says well no</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.890" end="00:53:29.990" style="s2">what about City what is it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.900" end="00:53:33.740" style="s2">present or absent when they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.990" end="00:53:35.150" style="s2">about the knowledge that enables that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.740" end="00:53:39.290" style="s2">enables the earth that enables the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.150" end="00:53:45.230" style="s2">excellence yeah yeah yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.290" end="00:53:46.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s meant by it oh cool well</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.230" end="00:53:48.109" style="s2">I&#39;ll Spidey&#39;s do you think that a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.550" end="00:53:49.670" style="s2">husband is able to agree with his wife</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.109" end="00:53:52.730" style="s2">about will working when he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.670" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">understand it and she does of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.730" end="00:53:56.920" style="s2">doubt nor does he have any need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:54:00.109" style="s2">because that&#39;s for a woman to know about</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.920" end="00:54:01.609" style="s2">that&#39;s right and as a woman able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.109" end="00:54:03.380" style="s2">agree with our husband about military</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.609" end="00:54:06.170" style="s2">tactics without having learned about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.380" end="00:54:09.130" style="s2">of course that I suppose you&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.170" end="00:54:11.600" style="s2">that&#39;s for a man to know about I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.130" end="00:54:13.730" style="s2">so according to your argument some</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.600" end="00:54:16.630" style="s2">subjects are women subjects and some are</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.730" end="00:54:19.100" style="s2">men&#39;s subjects of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.630" end="00:54:22.670" style="s2">so in these areas at least there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.100" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">agreement between men and women no nor</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.670" end="00:54:28.609" style="s2">is there any friendship since friendship</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.650" end="00:54:31.460" style="s2">was agreement apparently not so women</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.609" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">are not loved by men insofar as they do</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.460" end="00:54:37.100" style="s2">their own work it seems none nor are men</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">loved by women and so far as they do</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.100" end="00:54:42.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no so now there are cities well</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:46.900" style="s2">governed when the different groups each</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.440" end="00:54:51.260" style="s2">do their own work but I think they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.900" end="00:54:53.150" style="s2">Socrates what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.260" end="00:54:55.369" style="s2">in that case there&#39;s no friendship in</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.150" end="00:54:56.990" style="s2">cities but we said friendship was</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.369" end="00:55:01.070" style="s2">present when cities are well governed</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.990" end="00:55:04.340" style="s2">and not otherwise I think it&#39;s when each</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.070" end="00:55:07.820" style="s2">person does his own work that needs your</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.340" end="00:55:10.940" style="s2">friendship results you&#39;ve just changed</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.820" end="00:55:12.320" style="s2">your mind what do you mean now can there</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.940" end="00:55:14.900" style="s2">be friendship without agreement</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.320" end="00:55:16.810" style="s2">can there be any agreement when some</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.900" end="00:55:21.560" style="s2">know about the matter and others don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.810" end="00:55:23.570" style="s2">there can&#39;t possibly but when everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.560" end="00:55:27.800" style="s2">does his own work is everyone being just</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.570" end="00:55:29.660" style="s2">or unjust just of course so when the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.800" end="00:55:33.470" style="s2">citizens do what is just in the city</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.660" end="00:55:40.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no friendship between them again</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.470" end="00:55:43.220" style="s2">Socrates I think there must be then what</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.940" end="00:55:46.430" style="s2">do you mean by this friendship and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.220" end="00:55:49.930" style="s2">agreement that we must be wise and good</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.430" end="00:55:52.609" style="s2">advisors in if we&#39;re to be good men I</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.930" end="00:55:54.740" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out what it is or who&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.609" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">it according to your argument it seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.740" end="00:55:58.840" style="s2">that sometimes certain people have it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:56:03.410" style="s2">and sometimes they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.840" end="00:56:07.400" style="s2">well Socrates I swear by the gods that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.410" end="00:56:12.530" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what I mean I think all</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.400" end="00:56:15.970" style="s2">must have been in an appalling state for</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.530" end="00:56:20.270" style="s2">a long time without being aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.970" end="00:56:22.910" style="s2">but don&#39;t lose heart if you were 50 when</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.270" end="00:56:25.220" style="s2">you realized it that would be hard for</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.910" end="00:56:28.700" style="s2">you to cultivate yourself but now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.220" end="00:56:31.760" style="s2">just the right age to see it now that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.700" end="00:56:34.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen it Socrates what should I do</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.760" end="00:56:37.490" style="s2">about it answer my questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.760" end="00:56:39.830" style="s2">Alcibiades if you do that then God</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.490" end="00:56:42.080" style="s2">willing if we are to trust in my</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.830" end="00:56:46.850" style="s2">divination you and I will be in a better</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.080" end="00:56:50.690" style="s2">state then we will be if it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.850" end="00:56:53.869" style="s2">my answering well then what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.690" end="00:56:55.310" style="s2">to cultivate oneself I&#39;m afraid we often</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.869" end="00:56:58.910" style="s2">think we&#39;re cultivating ourselves when</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.310" end="00:57:00.560" style="s2">we&#39;re not when does a man do that is he</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.910" end="00:57:05.090" style="s2">cultivating himself when he cultivates</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.560" end="00:57:09.260" style="s2">what he has I think so</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.090" end="00:57:11.480" style="s2">anyway really when does a man cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.260" end="00:57:15.100" style="s2">her care for his feet is that when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.480" end="00:57:18.610" style="s2">caring for what belongs to his feet I</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.100" end="00:57:18.610" style="s2">don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.860" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">is there anything is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.500" end="00:57:29.180" style="s2">you&#39;d say belonged to a hand take a ring</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:31.850" style="s2">for example could it belong anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.180" end="00:57:52.070" style="s2">else on a man but on his finger of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.850" end="00:57:58.870" style="s2">course not similarly a shoe belongs</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.070" end="00:58:01.640" style="s2">nowhere but on the feet yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.870" end="00:58:05.210" style="s2">likewise cloaks and bedclothes belong to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.640" end="00:58:07.910" style="s2">the rest of the body yes so when we</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.210" end="00:58:11.570" style="s2">cultivate or care for our shoes are we</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.910" end="00:58:17.690" style="s2">caring for our feet I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.570" end="00:58:19.370" style="s2">understand Socrates surely Alcibiades</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.690" end="00:58:21.140" style="s2">you talk about proper you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.370" end="00:58:25.400" style="s2">taking proper care of one thing or</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.140" end="00:58:27.380" style="s2">another don&#39;t you yes I do and when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.400" end="00:58:30.100" style="s2">make something better you say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.380" end="00:58:32.650" style="s2">taking proper care of it yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.100" end="00:58:36.830" style="s2">what skill is it that makes shoes better</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.650" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">shoe making so shoe making is the skill</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.830" end="00:58:41.870" style="s2">by which we take care of our shoes yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:44.150" style="s2">do we use shoe making to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.870" end="00:58:45.430" style="s2">our feet too or do we use the skill that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.150" end="00:58:48.590" style="s2">makes our feet better</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.430" end="00:58:50.150" style="s2">the latter isn&#39;t the skill that makes</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.590" end="00:58:53.770" style="s2">our feet better the same as what makes</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.150" end="00:58:58.760" style="s2">the rest of the body better I think so</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.770" end="00:59:01.190" style="s2">isn&#39;t the skill athletics yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.760" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">so I&#39;ll be take care of our feet with</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.190" end="00:59:07.240" style="s2">athletics we take care of what belongs</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:09.410" style="s2">to our feet was to making certainly and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.240" end="00:59:10.790" style="s2">while we take care of our hands with</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.410" end="00:59:15.110" style="s2">athletics we take care of what belongs</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.790" end="00:59:16.760" style="s2">to our hands with ring making yes and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.110" end="00:59:18.280" style="s2">and while we cultivate our bodies with</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.760" end="00:59:20.440" style="s2">athletics we keep we take</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.280" end="00:59:23.650" style="s2">care of what belongs to our bodies with</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.440" end="00:59:24.820" style="s2">weaving and other skills that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.650" end="00:59:27.070" style="s2">absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.820" end="00:59:29.020" style="s2">so while we cultivate each thing with</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.070" end="00:59:32.440" style="s2">one skill we cultivate what belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.020" end="00:59:35.290" style="s2">it with another skill apparently so</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.440" end="00:59:37.420" style="s2">and so when you&#39;re cultivating what</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.290" end="00:59:42.340" style="s2">belongs to you you&#39;re not cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.420" end="00:59:44.320" style="s2">yourself not at all for it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.340" end="00:59:46.180" style="s2">cultivating yourself and cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.320" end="00:59:50.320" style="s2">what belongs to you require different</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.180" end="00:59:51.880" style="s2">skills apparently well then what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.320" end="00:59:58.630" style="s2">skill could we use to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.880" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">ourselves I couldn&#39;t say but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.630" end="01:00:02.290" style="s2">agreed on this much at least it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:05.380" style="s2">skill that won&#39;t make anything that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.290" end="01:00:09.310" style="s2">belongs to us better but will make us</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.380" end="01:00:11.830" style="s2">better you&#39;re right now if we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.310" end="01:00:15.430" style="s2">what a shoe was would we have known what</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.830" end="01:00:18.520" style="s2">skill makes a shoe better no we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.430" end="01:00:20.110" style="s2">have nor would we have known what skill</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.520" end="01:00:24.220" style="s2">makes a ring better if we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.110" end="01:00:26.470" style="s2">what a ring was true well then could we</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.220" end="01:00:29.770" style="s2">ever know what skill makes us better if</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.470" end="01:00:32.790" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what we were what didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.770" end="01:00:36.790" style="s2">know I&#39;m sorry what we were we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.790" end="01:00:40.990" style="s2">is it actually such an easy thing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.790" end="01:00:43.300" style="s2">know oneself was it some simpleton who</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.990" end="01:00:46.330" style="s2">inscribed those words on the temple wall</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.300" end="01:00:49.960" style="s2">at Delphi or is it difficult and not for</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.330" end="01:00:54.130" style="s2">everybody sometimes I think Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.960" end="01:00:58.540" style="s2">that anyone can do it but then sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.130" end="01:01:00.420" style="s2">I think it&#39;s extremely difficult but our</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.540" end="01:01:02.950" style="s2">societies whether it&#39;s easy or not</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.420" end="01:01:05.710" style="s2">nevertheless this is the situation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.950" end="01:01:07.540" style="s2">in if we know ourselves then we might be</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.710" end="01:01:09.610" style="s2">able to know how to cultivate ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.540" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">but if we don&#39;t know ourselves we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.610" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">never know how I agree</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.619" end="01:01:23.660" style="s2">tell me how can we find out what itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.890" end="01:01:25.670" style="s2">is in itself maybe this is the maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.660" end="01:01:27.799" style="s2">this is the way to find out what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.670" end="01:01:31.059" style="s2">ourselves might be maybe it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.799" end="01:01:33.859" style="s2">possible way you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.059" end="01:01:41.660" style="s2">hold on by Zeus who are you speaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.859" end="01:01:45.170" style="s2">with now anybody but me no and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.660" end="01:01:47.959" style="s2">speaking with you yes as Socrates doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.170" end="01:01:50.439" style="s2">the talking he certainly is and as</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.959" end="01:01:53.089" style="s2">Alcibiades doing the listening yes and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.439" end="01:01:55.939" style="s2">isn&#39;t Socrates talking with words of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.089" end="01:02:00.769" style="s2">course I suppose you&#39;d say that talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.939" end="01:02:02.989" style="s2">is the same as using words certainly but</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.769" end="01:02:07.390" style="s2">the thing being used and the person</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.989" end="01:02:07.390" style="s2">using it they&#39;re different aren&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.739" end="01:02:15.819" style="s2">what do you mean how apropos of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.319" end="01:02:18.739" style="s2">earlier conversation huh yeah a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.819" end="01:02:21.410" style="s2">shoemaker for example cuts with a knife</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.739" end="01:02:25.969" style="s2">and a scraper I think and with other</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.410" end="01:02:28.069" style="s2">tools yes he does so it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.969" end="01:02:31.189" style="s2">cutter who uses the tools different from</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.069" end="01:02:34.069" style="s2">the tools he&#39;s cutting with of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.189" end="01:02:36.069" style="s2">and likewise isn&#39;t the lyre player</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.069" end="01:02:40.910" style="s2">different from what he&#39;s playing with</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.069" end="01:02:43.519" style="s2">yes this is what I was just asking</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.910" end="01:02:46.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t the user of a thing always seem</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.519" end="01:02:49.279" style="s2">to be different from what he&#39;s using it</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.670" end="01:02:50.809" style="s2">seems so let&#39;s think about the shoe</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.279" end="01:02:54.759" style="s2">maker again does he cut with his tools</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.809" end="01:02:54.759" style="s2">only or does he also cut with his hands</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.299" end="01:03:02.989" style="s2">with his hands do so he uses his hands</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.579" end="01:03:04.459" style="s2">too yes and doesn&#39;t use his eyes too and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.989" end="01:03:06.529" style="s2">shoemaking yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.459" end="01:03:08.119" style="s2">didn&#39;t we agree that the person who uses</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.529" end="01:03:11.299" style="s2">something is different from the thing he</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.119" end="01:03:13.099" style="s2">uses yes so the shoe maker in the lyre</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.299" end="01:03:14.859" style="s2">player are different from the hands and</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.099" end="01:03:18.589" style="s2">eyes they use in their work</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.859" end="01:03:22.939" style="s2">so it seems doesn&#39;t a man use his whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.589" end="01:03:24.499" style="s2">body to certainly and we agreed that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.939" end="01:03:27.619" style="s2">user is different from the thing being</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.499" end="01:03:29.240" style="s2">used yes so a man is different from his</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.619" end="01:03:34.430" style="s2">own body so it</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.240" end="01:03:34.940" style="s2">seems than what is a man I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.430" end="01:03:39.230" style="s2">what to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.940" end="01:03:39.230" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.470" end="01:03:45.350" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.240" end="01:04:02.090" style="s2">yes you do think apropos you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.530" end="01:04:03.560" style="s2">go back to the thing that he when you</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.090" end="01:04:07.660" style="s2">mention that apropos to what we were</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.560" end="01:04:10.580" style="s2">talking about earlier oh just about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.660" end="01:04:14.020" style="s2">that the techne the use of the use of</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.580" end="01:04:18.110" style="s2">instruments yeah in the technique of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.020" end="01:04:22.100" style="s2">dialogue all right the the use of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.110" end="01:04:24.440" style="s2">words in the dissociation of the logos</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.100" end="01:04:28.250" style="s2">of intelligibility from the words that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.440" end="01:04:29.780" style="s2">are Rick are composing yes the logos</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.250" end="01:04:31.910" style="s2">right that the logos of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.780" end="01:04:34.910" style="s2">intelligibility is also always in excess</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.910" end="01:04:38.210" style="s2">of the yeah logos of the discourse and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.910" end="01:04:45.380" style="s2">the speech that&#39;s used to contain it</p>

<p begin="01:05:00.170" end="01:05:07.760" style="s2">listening right Socrates asking him that</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.480" end="01:05:10.070" style="s2">yeah yeah right who is it that&#39;s doing</p>
