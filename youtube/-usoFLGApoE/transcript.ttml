<p begin="00:05:25.350" end="00:05:32.500" style="s2">why I wouldn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.080" end="00:05:35.140" style="s2">you know and so they could go that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.500" end="00:05:37.660" style="s2">kind of a open question for me I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.140" end="00:05:42.250" style="s2">say that I love I love to I love to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.660" end="00:05:44.919" style="s2">teach and I can feel that the word coach</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.250" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">has a boundary or parameter around it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.919" end="00:05:55.780" style="s2">that I don&#39;t step into so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:58.860" style="s2">a question that I have to learn today my</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.780" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">name is Topher I am NOT a coach although</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:03.580" style="s2">everyone&#39;s saying I&#39;m not a coach</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.509" end="00:06:21.879" style="s2">and just listen on perspectives of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.419" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">two coaches run into what are some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.879" end="00:06:25.569" style="s2">the that was one of the themes I</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:28.090" style="s2">understand for today was what are some</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.569" end="00:06:33.430" style="s2">of the difficult situations that you run</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.090" end="00:06:37.629" style="s2">into and how do you navigate them thanks</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.430" end="00:06:40.690" style="s2">uncle Miller and I&#39;ve been a spiritual</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.229" end="00:06:51.159" style="s2">central concern through all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.360" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">ego my own of course and also how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.159" end="00:06:56.680" style="s2">relate to it how did it work with it how</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">to think about it in a 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.680" end="00:07:03.370" style="s2">context and I just know being with this</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:06.819" style="s2">group of people that I can learn a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.370" end="00:07:12.550" style="s2">so I also run a mindfulness meditation</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.819" end="00:07:20.469" style="s2">group and ego is big I mean it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.550" end="00:07:23.110" style="s2">been a big concern and it still is so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.469" end="00:07:26.680" style="s2">I&#39;m just maybe I can learn more about my</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.110" end="00:07:36.839" style="s2">own and and then how to work with others</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.680" end="00:07:41.289" style="s2">that&#39;s out I&#39;m echo I&#39;m not a culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.839" end="00:07:43.330" style="s2">but I have you know three months ago you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.289" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">know I&#39;ve been living this very you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.330" end="00:07:48.310" style="s2">sort of simple life and following my</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.490" end="00:07:50.860" style="s2">tradition which is Chan Buddhism I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.310" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">been practicing for a number of years I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.860" end="00:07:56.860" style="s2">only follow the one teacher so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.930" style="s2">like you know life is pretty good you</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.860" end="00:08:02.289" style="s2">know it&#39;s fine I&#39;m satisfied with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.930" end="00:08:04.599" style="s2">and then three months ago I met Bill and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.289" end="00:08:10.089" style="s2">then he throwing all these different</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.599" end="00:08:13.990" style="s2">kind of approaches and different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.089" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">religious you know seekers and thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.990" end="00:08:18.529" style="s2">and all that and all the sudden I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:23.229" style="s2">like wow there&#39;s some area</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.529" end="00:08:26.209" style="s2">completely just like missing and and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.229" end="00:08:29.179" style="s2">he told me about this it&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.209" end="00:08:33.379" style="s2">and said you know it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.179" end="00:08:36.680" style="s2">opportunity to come and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.379" end="00:08:40.430" style="s2">I&#39;m here but I also read a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.680" end="00:08:42.469" style="s2">about what you did and it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.430" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">interesting so no scientifically mapping</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.469" end="00:08:49.519" style="s2">out what the mine is actually and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:52.819" style="s2">and that&#39;s all my curiosity from that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.519" end="00:08:55.459" style="s2">that yes we can scientifically making</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.839" end="00:10:02.059" style="s2">being there but then coming to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.850" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">Western you know fertile ground which</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">there and then to hear people ready and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.790" end="00:10:31.220" style="s2">how the capacity really get into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:31.930" style="s2">the minds and how do you then merge them</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.220" end="00:10:35.140" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.930" end="00:10:39.640" style="s2">how do you then create a way of just</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.140" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">sort of like to make that happen here as</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.640" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">well so that that&#39;s my that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:46.570" style="s2">question cuz I&#39;m I&#39;m having uh I have a</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.430" end="00:11:08.380" style="s2">teach without words at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.590" end="00:11:11.080" style="s2">how do you then teach people the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.380" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">that cannot be teached by words that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.080" end="00:11:59.890" style="s2">the question I feel fortunate place</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:43.790" style="s2">they&#39;re even though coaching still kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">of belial</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.790" end="00:12:48.950" style="s2">West in terms of a regulated industry</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">that there are you know where does</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.950" end="00:12:53.150" style="s2">coaching stop and mentoring begin</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:55.340" style="s2">teaching come in so there is a blend</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.150" end="00:12:58.400" style="s2">there for sure I just love the way this</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.340" end="00:13:00.080" style="s2">conversation is framed you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.400" end="00:13:03.170" style="s2">importance of ego development and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.080" end="00:13:05.660" style="s2">awareness of it and tailored versus</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.170" end="00:13:07.460" style="s2">regular coaching so I just I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.660" end="00:13:09.710" style="s2">forward to what this is going to go so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.460" end="00:13:11.840" style="s2">really appreciate me and I just loved</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.710" end="00:13:14.510" style="s2">how you all felt into one of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.840" end="00:13:18.890" style="s2">straps one way you can say we have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.510" end="00:13:20.690" style="s2">more expansive self or ego is by where</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.890" end="00:13:23.840" style="s2">we make the boundaries as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.690" end="00:13:26.060" style="s2">say I&#39;m not that you put a whole part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.840" end="00:13:29.180" style="s2">the world outside of your own interior</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.060" end="00:13:31.730" style="s2">and so it was just fascinating it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.180" end="00:13:33.730" style="s2">sometimes you think okay what somebody</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.730" end="00:13:36.740" style="s2">says from before but it is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.730" end="00:13:39.380" style="s2">imagine but all those distinctions we</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.740" end="00:13:42.770" style="s2">were making between teacher mentor just</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.380" end="00:13:44.810" style="s2">human being friend coach they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.770" end="00:13:47.690" style="s2">artificial boundaries and they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.810" end="00:13:50.600" style="s2">for a good reason because we wanna have</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.690" end="00:13:52.640" style="s2">some control over who does what and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.600" end="00:13:54.830" style="s2">know it&#39;s it has become an industry so</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.640" end="00:13:56.960" style="s2">we need some some we need some</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.830" end="00:13:59.770" style="s2">guidelines but it&#39;s interesting when we</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.960" end="00:14:02.810" style="s2">then identify that way I&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.770" end="00:14:05.530" style="s2">because I don&#39;t have the credentials I</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.810" end="00:14:08.510" style="s2">think it&#39;s what the next phrase would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.530" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">whereas we coach in for money I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.510" end="00:14:15.020" style="s2">each other here and there all the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">with these are all saw through it that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.020" end="00:14:25.160" style="s2">we take on so clearly I can do a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">bit of lecturing before we discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.160" end="00:14:30.620" style="s2">question you raise how did the to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:33.590" style="s2">eastern the Western come together we say</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.620" end="00:14:38.840" style="s2">two things we say one Western psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.590" end="00:14:41.780" style="s2">is bottom-up and eastern side quality is</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.840" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">top down so you start out with the big</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.780" end="00:14:47.840" style="s2">mind or the supreme whatever you call it</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">and then you think Nate more and more a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.840" end="00:14:55.400" style="s2">moment comes more and more gross and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:57.379" style="s2">material the sword whatever terms you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.400" end="00:14:59.329" style="s2">use and in that I call it</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.379" end="00:15:01.759" style="s2">we tend to start at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.329" end="00:15:04.819" style="s2">newborn child and we look at how does it</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.759" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">develop in all realms emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.819" end="00:15:11.449" style="s2">cognitively behaviorally and so the to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:14.929" style="s2">kind of complement each other in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.449" end="00:15:18.439" style="s2">way we&#39;re also talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.929" end="00:15:22.789" style="s2">difference between growing up it which</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.439" end="00:15:28.729" style="s2">this year is about and waking up there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.789" end="00:15:31.579" style="s2">a different intent and often spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.729" end="00:15:32.449" style="s2">teaching have to do is helping people to</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.579" end="00:15:34.939" style="s2">wake up</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.449" end="00:15:39.049" style="s2">not necessarily to grow up they may go</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.939" end="00:15:42.169" style="s2">up anyway as well as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.049" end="00:15:43.849" style="s2">learning they&#39;re doing but does these</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.169" end="00:15:46.939" style="s2">are that these things I think they fit</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.849" end="00:15:49.939" style="s2">each other nicely now because what was</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.939" end="00:15:53.329" style="s2">usually lacking it in the east of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.939" end="00:15:55.970" style="s2">traditions was a good idea of what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.329" end="00:15:58.849" style="s2">ego is it was just assumed everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.970" end="00:16:01.850" style="s2">a healthy ego we start out there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.849" end="00:16:04.489" style="s2">then we transcend it but the rough road</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.850" end="00:16:08.179" style="s2">to how to actually develop the healthy</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.489" end="00:16:13.039" style="s2">mature legal is what Eastern psychology</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.179" end="00:16:14.119" style="s2">has been a lot of time now on so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.039" end="00:16:17.689" style="s2">where I come from</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.119" end="00:16:20.059" style="s2">I was always not that I&#39;m not interested</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.689" end="00:16:22.669" style="s2">in the other the spiritual side but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.059" end="00:16:25.309" style="s2">was interested in how do we become</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.669" end="00:16:28.850" style="s2">adults how do we mature once we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.309" end="00:16:29.419" style="s2">adults and what difference does that</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:26.539" style="s2">support it which is what how most</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.750" end="00:17:28.730" style="s2">theories actually happened they&#39;re based</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.539" end="00:17:32.390" style="s2">on very little data this is totally day</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.730" end="00:17:35.720" style="s2">after day even even today but the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.390" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">of that is that you can find Pavin in</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.720" end="00:17:44.120" style="s2">the data that&#39;s what anything we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:46.429" style="s2">gasp the challenge is that of course no</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.120" end="00:17:49.970" style="s2">data also challenges what you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.429" end="00:17:52.519" style="s2">before especially when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.970" end="00:17:54.950" style="s2">field where people develop and then more</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.519" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">people developing to the later stages</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.950" end="00:18:00.950" style="s2">then sometimes you have to say well the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:03.980" style="s2">see you guys have developed - that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.950" end="00:18:07.190" style="s2">a good sales point people want something</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.980" end="00:18:09.710" style="s2">that&#39;s fixed and Static and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:12.500" style="s2">this is how it is not this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.710" end="00:18:14.899" style="s2">looks like easy ways to develop and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.500" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s just interesting to me it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.899" end="00:18:23.090" style="s2">alive but it&#39;s now the development of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:25.399" style="s2">the you the government is not static so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.090" end="00:18:30.889" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of paradox isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.399" end="00:18:32.929" style="s2">working with this continent and in in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.889" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">nutshell how can I say the theory is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.929" end="00:18:39.529" style="s2">basically one that says from when you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:41.960" style="s2">have the hand out here the chose the are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.529" end="00:18:45.409" style="s2">and there are many different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.960" end="00:18:47.690" style="s2">showing the same material in this case</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.409" end="00:18:50.870" style="s2">I&#39;m showing the art because I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.690" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">life is a you know life span of whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.870" end="00:18:56.019" style="s2">thing and you start out as a newborn</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:19:00.230" style="s2">where you have no separation no</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.019" end="00:19:03.139" style="s2">differentiation no words yet you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.230" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">some experiences already from your being</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.139" end="00:19:08.210" style="s2">in the womb but you don&#39;t have any way</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:10.159" style="s2">mom and you are just one assuming the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.210" end="00:19:13.279" style="s2">nipple you are one I mean there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.159" end="00:19:17.179" style="s2">you know big nipple in the sky and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.279" end="00:19:21.289" style="s2">joy of being in union with that with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.179" end="00:19:24.860" style="s2">source of life with that milk then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.289" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">go through this quite lengthy process of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.860" end="00:19:30.340" style="s2">reaching more than our culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:34.100" style="s2">Western cultures considered and adult</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.340" end="00:19:37.460" style="s2">Piaget was also Swiss like myself was</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.100" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">the first to actually look 30 in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.460" end="00:19:43.940" style="s2">last century look how children develop</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.190" end="00:19:47.570" style="s2">and said they&#39;re not just stupid</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.940" end="00:19:50.020" style="s2">adults they&#39;re actually making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.570" end="00:19:52.910" style="s2">things and they make sense of things by</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.020" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">interacting with the world and he looked</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.910" end="00:19:59.179" style="s2">at the pattern of that so he described</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:20:00.919" style="s2">this movement and then we all thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.179" end="00:20:04.970" style="s2">then there&#39;s still the general knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.919" end="00:20:10.370" style="s2">in sort of the Western world is we all</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.970" end="00:20:16.010" style="s2">the after year about age 20 25 maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.370" end="00:20:20.390" style="s2">then what downhill from there and only</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.010" end="00:20:23.000" style="s2">the last when 1960s were the first ones</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.390" end="00:20:23.510" style="s2">to say no when we actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.000" end="00:20:27.320" style="s2">dots</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.510" end="00:20:30.290" style="s2">some of them develop further some get</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.320" end="00:20:34.130" style="s2">broader perspectives than what Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.290" end="00:20:36.830" style="s2">had us the endpoint but it&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.130" end="00:20:40.130" style="s2">fruit few so it takes a long time to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.830" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">the data to actually show that to not</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:44.809" style="s2">prove it in qualitative sense but to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:46.780" style="s2">show that is patterns and others can</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.809" end="00:20:50.210" style="s2">understand too</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.780" end="00:20:52.780" style="s2">so as coaches and we go over the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.210" end="00:20:55.730" style="s2">coaching we were saying we&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.780" end="00:20:58.429" style="s2">healthy adults function not healthy but</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.730" end="00:20:59.770" style="s2">functional adults be even more</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.429" end="00:21:03.320" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.770" end="00:21:06.710" style="s2">what would therapy say what do</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.320" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">therapists do that&#39;s different as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.710" end="00:21:11.059" style="s2">we work with non functional</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.880" style="s2">non-functional as for people after</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.059" end="00:21:16.429" style="s2">suffering we really come to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.880" end="00:21:19.669" style="s2">therapist because they are confused</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.429" end="00:21:21.830" style="s2">suffering non functioning I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.669" end="00:21:24.770" style="s2">all kinds of things that they they need</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.830" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">help for so in therapy you generally go</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:32.350" style="s2">further back and you look at the origin</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:35.150" style="s2">the causes of what&#39;s the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.350" end="00:21:38.870" style="s2">encoding you generally look forward and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.150" end="00:21:41.750" style="s2">assume people have resources to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.870" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">forward and occasionally of course they</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.750" end="00:21:47.420" style="s2">did after a while I discovered is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">something that needs a deeper look and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.420" end="00:21:52.580" style="s2">then you might refer them to a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re a responsible coach you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.580" end="00:22:00.070" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t think you can do everything and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:22:02.690" style="s2">really work on things I can do and what</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.070" end="00:22:06.460" style="s2">identity I carry and how much</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.690" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">responsibility I take and how much</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.460" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">reward I feel myself with for being a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:17.810" style="s2">good teacher a good coach and all that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:20.060" style="s2">that is he door stuff how much am i</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.810" end="00:22:22.820" style="s2">identified was the outcome of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.060" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">whatever I&#39;m doing do I hold that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.820" end="00:22:31.070" style="s2">lightly do I see it as just sowing seeds</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:33.710" style="s2">and they may fall wherever they fall</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.070" end="00:22:37.940" style="s2">fallow ground beautiful or wait for</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.710" end="00:22:42.950" style="s2">years before they come forward we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.940" end="00:22:46.100" style="s2">know and that how people will attitude</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.950" end="00:22:48.500" style="s2">somebody has to in their craft whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.100" end="00:22:55.040" style="s2">it is that is a matter of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.500" end="00:22:57.860" style="s2">development so a a an ego a person</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.040" end="00:23:00.700" style="s2">rather may interpret post conventional</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.860" end="00:23:05.630" style="s2">experience from a conventional</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.700" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">perspective and get into trouble or just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.630" end="00:23:12.200" style="s2">lots of trouble you know we all know</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">about this stuff also the spiritual kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.200" end="00:23:19.390" style="s2">of trouble trying so what what we really</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:22.910" style="s2">think is in order to transcend the ego</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.390" end="00:23:25.010" style="s2">to go back to the eastern some general</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.910" end="00:23:30.200" style="s2">look at things you have to have a mature</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.010" end="00:23:33.050" style="s2">ego yes but what people often wanted a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.200" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">soldier and for liberation for something</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.050" end="00:23:38.780" style="s2">else they may have had a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">moment of feeling that transcendence the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.780" end="00:23:45.890" style="s2">unity at the other end because it comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:48.260" style="s2">back but you can with your mind and with</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.890" end="00:23:51.050" style="s2">your experience you can tap into peak</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.260" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">moments you can tap into a meditative</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.050" end="00:23:55.880" style="s2">unity</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:59.000" style="s2">he&#39;s temporarily and then think you got</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.880" end="00:24:01.309" style="s2">it now I&#39;m here now I&#39;m people</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.309" end="00:24:07.580" style="s2">nowhere near there because what we also</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.730" end="00:24:10.130" style="s2">think and I guess it comes from I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.580" end="00:24:13.240" style="s2">training as a same Magda sister so</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.130" end="00:24:17.800" style="s2">linguist is that whatever you experience</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:36.140" style="s2">using it very carefully yes so here we</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.070" end="00:24:39.260" style="s2">start with embeddedness then we</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.460" end="00:26:07.720" style="s2">yeah I have a question yeah they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.210" end="00:26:11.649" style="s2">so postconventional as a society moves</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.720" end="00:26:14.769" style="s2">right so if you have relative this kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.649" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">of understanding in schools let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.769" end="00:26:20.200" style="s2">know that&#39;s not really true but as your</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">society moves does this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.200" end="00:26:24.429" style="s2">like well that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying yes we</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:26.679" style="s2">know that we already have given and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.429" end="00:26:30.179" style="s2">maybe 30 40 years ago when the</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.179" end="00:26:36.999" style="s2">what is it called diversity issues came</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.100" end="00:26:39.519" style="s2">into being that came out of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.999" end="00:26:42.070" style="s2">thinking we really beyond what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.519" end="00:26:43.139" style="s2">culture had but now of course it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.070" end="00:26:46.119" style="s2">soon as it gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.139" end="00:26:48.999" style="s2">legalized soon it becomes part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.119" end="00:26:51.730" style="s2">legal structure then it appears those</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.999" end="00:26:54.340" style="s2">sentences those things appear much</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.730" end="00:26:56.950" style="s2">earlier and you can no longer say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.340" end="00:26:58.749" style="s2">gospel mates will be forever an index</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.950" end="00:27:02.279" style="s2">for for school mates you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.749" end="00:27:04.830" style="s2">long great confusion that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.279" end="00:27:07.059" style="s2">especially in our community because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.830" end="00:27:10.509" style="s2">interface with a lot of people that grow</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.059" end="00:27:12.399" style="s2">up with kind of parents that have been</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.509" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">practicing and I&#39;ve been reading and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.399" end="00:27:17.080" style="s2">this and that and then the children grow</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:19.570" style="s2">up at a very young age and they appear</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.080" end="00:27:22.090" style="s2">to be post conventional but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.570" end="00:27:25.539" style="s2">because they&#39;re that&#39;s conventional to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.090" end="00:27:27.999" style="s2">their reality yes that&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.539" end="00:27:30.580" style="s2">can even see in different cultures where</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.999" end="00:27:32.980" style="s2">the cultural values up though the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.580" end="00:27:35.139" style="s2">artfully the level I&#39;ve actually tested</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.980" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">that was Switzerland in general in</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.139" end="00:27:41.769" style="s2">Switzerland the values that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:45.450" style="s2">community shares are much more like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.769" end="00:27:49.059" style="s2">today here you know conserving and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.450" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">recycling all those those ideas those</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.059" end="00:27:55.480" style="s2">values but the people are not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:58.029" style="s2">more evolved they&#39;re just having been</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.480" end="00:28:00.340" style="s2">brought up within those values and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.029" end="00:28:02.529" style="s2">hail them that the way you can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.340" end="00:28:05.529" style="s2">the rigidity with which you hold the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.529" end="00:28:08.649" style="s2">value the more rigid the more attached</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.529" end="00:28:11.710" style="s2">you are to it the less likely you are at</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.649" end="00:28:13.749" style="s2">the flexible moment to stage there and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.710" end="00:28:14.830" style="s2">then there&#39;s something else happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.749" end="00:28:17.590" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.830" end="00:28:20.650" style="s2">that is to me even more confusing they</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.590" end="00:28:23.320" style="s2">where I used to work you know we had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.650" end="00:28:25.570" style="s2">lot of Ecuadorians come up from down</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.320" end="00:28:27.940" style="s2">there the legally and what they had to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.570" end="00:28:30.010" style="s2">go through to leave their life and come</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.940" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">in and establish their only businesses</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.010" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">and their own families it was now they</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:37.990" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t ask cause conventional but what</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:40.419" style="s2">we did is we went in and we worked with</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.990" end="00:28:44.049" style="s2">them so that they had to be taught</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.419" end="00:28:46.779" style="s2">things like that they knew more than</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.049" end="00:28:48.429" style="s2">some of the guys that were it was a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.779" end="00:28:50.380" style="s2">landscaping company so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.429" end="00:28:51.010" style="s2">people have been working there forever</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.380" end="00:28:53.289" style="s2">Awards</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.010" end="00:28:55.240" style="s2">typically Western conventional but these</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.289" end="00:28:57.820" style="s2">guys even though their language skills</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.240" end="00:29:00.490" style="s2">in their understanding of America wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.820" end="00:29:03.460" style="s2">high there was something about their</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.490" end="00:29:05.110" style="s2">spirit that was like post-convention on</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.460" end="00:29:07.570" style="s2">we made them managers because they had</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.110" end="00:29:09.429" style="s2">to understand this thing and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.570" end="00:29:11.230" style="s2">real opportunity and think that&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.429" end="00:29:13.289" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think they would score</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.230" end="00:29:16.090" style="s2">post conventional but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.289" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">there&#39;s something about them that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.090" end="00:29:20.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to explain that you that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:23.049" style="s2">you experience as a type of maturity I</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.620" end="00:29:25.990" style="s2">mean tend to use that word just clearly</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.049" end="00:29:28.870" style="s2">as what we call everything and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.990" end="00:29:31.330" style="s2">indeed if you look if you look in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.870" end="00:29:34.090" style="s2">own right at that other culture you</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.330" end="00:29:36.730" style="s2">would find we assume because that seems</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.090" end="00:29:39.610" style="s2">to be verified worldwide universally</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.730" end="00:29:41.730" style="s2">those Big Chief seem to be everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.610" end="00:29:45.220" style="s2">and everything whether the cultures</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.730" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">collective or individualistic overall</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.220" end="00:29:49.630" style="s2">you still see these and you can still</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:52.990" style="s2">tell who is more mature and worse and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.630" end="00:29:56.770" style="s2">you just can&#39;t there may be a totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.990" end="00:29:58.840" style="s2">different knowledge base it may be but</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.770" end="00:30:02.409" style="s2">that shows up there as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.840" end="00:30:03.010" style="s2">yeah I mean I totally think that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.409" end="00:30:06.190" style="s2">be real</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">yes and the intuition about their level</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.190" end="00:30:11.649" style="s2">of capacity and a few thought if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.020" style="s2">test them with this instrument no they</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.649" end="00:30:16.659" style="s2">would not I would be not the writing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.020" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">lose but like one of the tests just to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.659" end="00:30:22.299" style="s2">ground it was there this one man in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">particular who we made manager you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.299" end="00:30:28.270" style="s2">he would come in and he&#39;d get beat up by</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:30.309" style="s2">the guys you know like they tease them</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.270" end="00:30:30.750" style="s2">and be rude at home and stuff and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.309" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.750" end="00:30:36.510" style="s2">so as he gained more power he was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:38.310" style="s2">push back until it got ugly and I had</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.510" end="00:30:41.190" style="s2">could have a conversation with him and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.310" end="00:30:43.650" style="s2">says no you know look at Eric you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.190" end="00:30:47.220" style="s2">what Eric is like he knew that Eric was</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.650" end="00:30:50.550" style="s2">not smart somewhat even disabled</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.220" end="00:30:53.880" style="s2">mentally just a guy you know and I could</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.550" end="00:30:56.910" style="s2">tell that this guy Wilma I could see him</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.880" end="00:30:59.790" style="s2">and I said so that&#39;s just you&#39;re Burt</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.910" end="00:31:02.010" style="s2">you can see him that&#39;s your burden you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.790" end="00:31:05.010" style="s2">have to be higher and it&#39;s not like he</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.010" end="00:31:08.280" style="s2">went higher and said oh I&#39;m higher he</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.010" end="00:31:11.730" style="s2">knew how to set in and make he knows he</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.280" end="00:31:14.040" style="s2">had to make Eric feel welcome that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.730" end="00:31:16.740" style="s2">just his burden even though he came on</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:20.010" style="s2">the boat and the whole thing that was in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.740" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">had that passion and shine because he</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.010" end="00:31:25.890" style="s2">had the capacity yes the other one did</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:28.680" style="s2">it and I knew he could see and so part</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.890" end="00:31:31.020" style="s2">of just failed on that part of this year</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.680" end="00:31:34.020" style="s2">is also that the lathe of the state you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.020" end="00:31:37.260" style="s2">really are the more responsibility you</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.020" end="00:31:43.140" style="s2">have no less or bleaches and we say in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.260" end="00:31:45.450" style="s2">in Europe that you that you that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.140" end="00:31:47.550" style="s2">tenant of all developmental think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.450" end="00:31:50.400" style="s2">hi you can see earlier because we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.550" end="00:31:52.380" style="s2">all come through it we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.400" end="00:31:55.070" style="s2">jump there are other premises we</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.380" end="00:31:58.110" style="s2">actually go through these levels and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.070" end="00:32:00.090" style="s2">then we can look back and they&#39;re within</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.110" end="00:32:02.250" style="s2">us it&#39;s like the chakras they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.090" end="00:32:05.280" style="s2">there I may actually mostly use one</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.250" end="00:32:07.950" style="s2">level but they&#39;re present they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.280" end="00:32:09.900" style="s2">but the universe is not from some value</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.950" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">is that the really early stage really</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.900" end="00:32:16.020" style="s2">has no other possibility they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:17.930" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.020" end="00:32:20.100" style="s2">this level if you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.930" end="00:32:22.830" style="s2">responsibility there&#39;s no time since</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.100" end="00:32:25.950" style="s2">there&#39;s no just me surviving just me</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.830" end="00:32:28.620" style="s2">getting to the next day just be against</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.620" end="00:32:35.400" style="s2">people in their own right there just</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.080" end="00:32:37.740" style="s2">sources of whatever I need and so there</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.400" end="00:32:39.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t blame them if they you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.740" end="00:32:42.510" style="s2">you have to fit</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.480" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">find ways to interact with that person</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.510" end="00:32:48.840" style="s2">that serves them</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:50.760" style="s2">and so a tendency particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.840" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">spiritual and the sort of early</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.760" end="00:32:58.700" style="s2">postconventional realm is to want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:33:00.570" style="s2">heal everything with love and</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.330" end="00:48:22.490" style="s2">developmental theory in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.860" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">background would be totally implicit</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.490" end="00:48:27.810" style="s2">then when you have just the regular</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:30.270" style="s2">training from a coaching school but</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.830" end="00:48:50.310" style="s2">background so I&#39;ll jump in here so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.900" end="00:48:51.900" style="s2">found I think the answer is yes if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.310" end="00:48:54.990" style="s2">have a developmental framework you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.900" end="00:48:57.150" style="s2">you at least have the capacity and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.990" end="00:48:59.160" style="s2">assuming whether you have the framework</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.150" end="00:49:00.840" style="s2">or not we&#39;re talking about confident</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.160" end="00:49:02.760" style="s2">coaches whether they are they have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.840" end="00:49:05.610" style="s2">framework or not so what a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.760" end="00:49:08.660" style="s2">framework coach has the capacity first</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.610" end="00:49:11.580" style="s2">of all to be aware of his or her own</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.660" end="00:49:15.120" style="s2">worldview and personality type and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.580" end="00:49:17.519" style="s2">of other things and with the proper</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.120" end="00:49:19.199" style="s2">training can be aware of morale</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.519" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">in a very very dynamic way because we</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.199" end="00:49:23.130" style="s2">don&#39;t assess somebody and think oh that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:25.469" style="s2">your that you don&#39;t lock them in</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.130" end="00:49:26.669" style="s2">somewhere but I have I&#39;m gonna speaking</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.469" end="00:49:29.039" style="s2">of reference oh I have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.669" end="00:49:30.599" style="s2">really listen carefully to language how</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.039" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">the person presents what their concern</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.599" end="00:49:35.189" style="s2">would and see developmentally where they</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:37.079" style="s2">or she might be if I&#39;m working with in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.189" end="00:49:38.789" style="s2">development to framework if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.079" end="00:49:41.719" style="s2">working within a developmental framework</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.789" end="00:49:44.699" style="s2">which we might call regular coaching</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.719" end="00:49:47.159" style="s2">let&#39;s say so and let&#39;s say I live as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.699" end="00:49:51.329" style="s2">expert that&#39;s where I am in my own life</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.159" end="00:49:54.329" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that I have a toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.329" end="00:49:57.449" style="s2">somebody comes to me I had was a series</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.329" end="00:49:59.569" style="s2">of toolkits and I&#39;m gonna use my toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.449" end="00:50:01.979" style="s2">on this client or these clients</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.569" end="00:50:03.959" style="s2">regardless of where they might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.979" end="00:50:05.729" style="s2">developmentally I&#39;m gonna use the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.959" end="00:50:09.059" style="s2">tool kit for everybody that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.729" end="00:50:11.309" style="s2">would call regular coaching whereas I</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.059" end="00:50:13.919" style="s2">have this slightly broader and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.309" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">toolkit where I can actually meet a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.919" end="00:50:17.219" style="s2">client where he or she is</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:20.819" style="s2">developmentally if I&#39;m working with in</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.219" end="00:50:22.769" style="s2">developmental framework so I I further</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.819" end="00:50:26.069" style="s2">humanized the client and let&#39;s objectify</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.769" end="00:50:29.729" style="s2">him or her because I&#39;ve done the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.069" end="00:50:32.429" style="s2">thing for myself already yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.729" end="00:50:35.159" style="s2">certainly one way of how we look at it</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.429" end="00:50:36.989" style="s2">any other things yeah I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.159" end="00:50:39.749" style="s2">somewhere and thank you for that because</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.989" end="00:50:42.149" style="s2">I just realized something</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.749" end="00:50:45.059" style="s2">so like there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.149" end="00:50:47.459" style="s2">being a developmental coach and being a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.059" end="00:50:50.789" style="s2">coach that tailors from a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.459" end="00:50:53.339" style="s2">freshman so because I think what you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.789" end="00:50:55.499" style="s2">mostly saying the developmental coach is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.339" end="00:50:58.799" style="s2">interested in moving people development</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.499" end="00:51:05.669" style="s2">like it come more with that country</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.799" end="00:51:08.669" style="s2">agenda and so for me the point of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.669" end="00:51:11.039" style="s2">could be a coach that tailors you need</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.669" end="00:51:13.380" style="s2">to enter their world and see what is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.039" end="00:51:17.249" style="s2">most appropriate adequate fit for them</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.380" end="00:51:19.169" style="s2">so you know a expert we were saying I</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.249" end="00:51:22.229" style="s2">was saying that it&#39;s lovely to work with</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.169" end="00:51:24.749" style="s2">these people because you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.229" end="00:51:26.330" style="s2">sometimes they just can&#39;t stick a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.749" end="00:51:28.610" style="s2">times experts have maps</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.330" end="00:51:30.140" style="s2">mental models of the world and they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.610" end="00:51:31.220" style="s2">mapping errors and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.140" end="00:51:34.040" style="s2">like Wow</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.220" end="00:51:36.560" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t and that helps them but</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.040" end="00:51:39.230" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t that whole that whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.560" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">interaction is still in their world you</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.230" end="00:51:46.510" style="s2">know and and so I think to tailor is be</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:50.360" style="s2">able to enter their world and coach them</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.510" end="00:51:53.240" style="s2">from there and sometimes people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.360" end="00:51:56.780" style="s2">moving and then you know that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.240" end="00:51:59.330" style="s2">needs to move developmentally but they</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.780" end="00:52:01.880" style="s2">stab me so y&#39;all so listen for that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.330" end="00:52:04.220" style="s2">obviously is it who sponsored I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.880" end="00:52:06.200" style="s2">the but a more corporate where people</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.220" end="00:52:08.540" style="s2">get sent to coaching so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.200" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">sponsored by something who are you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.540" end="00:52:13.280" style="s2">responsible to its to its your client</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:15.470" style="s2">even if it means that you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:18.790" style="s2">they should leave the job they&#39;re in or</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.470" end="00:52:21.230" style="s2">I use you know responsible to it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.790" end="00:52:22.820" style="s2">organization who pays you for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.230" end="00:52:25.100" style="s2">coaching you have to negotiate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.820" end="00:52:27.950" style="s2">upfront obviously you have to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.100" end="00:52:31.370" style="s2">that this is an issue and not blind the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.950" end="00:52:33.590" style="s2">fall into it and yes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.370" end="00:52:37.550" style="s2">difference so there&#39;s plenty of schools</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.590" end="00:52:41.480" style="s2">effective coaching out there certified</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.550" end="00:52:43.460" style="s2">coaches who have a toolkit that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.480" end="00:52:45.140" style="s2">learned in their coaching school and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.460" end="00:52:49.000" style="s2">they just apply it they&#39;ve applied</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.140" end="00:52:52.250" style="s2">either as experts and don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.000" end="00:52:56.120" style="s2">earlier stages even want to be coaches</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.250" end="00:52:57.950" style="s2">necessarily but the expert goes about</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.120" end="00:53:00.920" style="s2">the business like that within any other</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.950" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">job as an expert I know what&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.920" end="00:53:06.110" style="s2">is and I&#39;m gonna teach you I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:09.110" style="s2">help you learn what I know so do these</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.110" end="00:53:12.350" style="s2">exercises so go home and write the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.110" end="00:53:16.570" style="s2">reflective journal is what will happens</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.350" end="00:53:16.570" style="s2">with an expert in the reflective journey</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.180" end="00:53:27.410" style="s2">nothing nothing anything why it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.560" end="00:53:30.470" style="s2">really come online yet what hasn&#39;t come</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.019" end="00:55:14.150" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t say that there then they</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.589" end="00:55:17.539" style="s2">don&#39;t even care about it I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.150" end="00:55:21.859" style="s2">now they do they have computers and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.539" end="00:55:23.960" style="s2">on but yeah they&#39;re not they&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.859" end="00:55:27.349" style="s2">they&#39;re not worried about developing for</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.960" end="00:55:29.509" style="s2">developing sake is their gold they</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.349" end="00:55:31.220" style="s2">happen recently though and I don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.509" end="00:55:34.579" style="s2">because they said you know when they saw</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.220" end="00:55:37.250" style="s2">that Quebec fall they said if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.579" end="00:55:40.759" style="s2">modernize the same things can happen to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.250" end="00:55:44.059" style="s2">us and they finally realize that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.759" end="00:55:46.940" style="s2">want to preserve and move that this was</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.059" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">real this wasn&#39;t an option that was real</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.940" end="00:55:49.730" style="s2">and it was going to come from the right</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:53.750" style="s2">guys to their own people</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.730" end="00:55:58.330" style="s2">so yes yeah I get what</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.750" end="00:56:02.990" style="s2">which suggests you know the the impulse</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.330" end="00:56:07.490" style="s2">for development is that innate or or not</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.990" end="00:56:09.830" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s the question as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.490" end="00:56:10.850" style="s2">both but you don&#39;t live in an isolated</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.830" end="00:56:13.690" style="s2">flow right now</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.850" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">gluten is not you know no one isolated</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.690" end="00:56:23.860" style="s2">so that&#39;s big part of the pressure how</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:27.050" style="s2">do you define happiness but they have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.860" end="00:56:29.300" style="s2">Gross National Happiness index rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.050" end="00:56:32.450" style="s2">than the money index which is really in</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.300" end="00:56:36.080" style="s2">itself a stage for kind of measure</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.450" end="00:56:39.290" style="s2">I mean idea not a beautifully stretched</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.080" end="00:56:41.540" style="s2">in the edges and going over there that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.290" end="00:56:44.510" style="s2">that&#39;s that idea you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.540" end="00:56:49.790" style="s2">measure more of the human being than</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.510" end="00:56:53.870" style="s2">just the money aspects of it yeah in our</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.790" end="00:56:56.900" style="s2">culture when it&#39;s spent on therapy is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.870" end="00:56:58.850" style="s2">positive thing in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.900" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">know it&#39;s income and so it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.850" end="00:57:03.910" style="s2">economy but it could also be indicative</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:31.610" style="s2">that you have a very unhappy population</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.910" end="00:57:32.870" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m getting depressed I&#39;m realizing</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.610" end="00:57:35.540" style="s2">as I&#39;m sitting here that I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.870" end="00:57:38.840" style="s2">conducting my meditation that in spite</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.540" end="00:57:40.940" style="s2">of myself I&#39;m looking at him and being</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.840" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">the development away of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.940" end="00:57:48.740" style="s2">coming up in my mind is am i doing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:50.810" style="s2">too much or am i doing it at the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.740" end="00:57:53.210" style="s2">time like when we were talking or a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.810" end="00:57:55.300" style="s2">group like there&#39;s a time to go specific</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.210" end="00:57:57.380" style="s2">and there&#39;s a time to step back in</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.300" end="00:57:59.330" style="s2">because once you&#39;ve been taught</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.380" end="00:58:02.120" style="s2">something in a masters to get your kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.330" end="00:58:06.090" style="s2">of socialized into loyalty all right yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.120" end="00:58:09.660" style="s2">and then you can&#39;t ever go back</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.090" end="00:58:12.150" style="s2">so can you go forward to beyond or have</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.660" end="00:58:15.780" style="s2">that as part of you time I like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.150" end="00:58:18.810" style="s2">about we have medicine bags with all our</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.780" end="00:58:20.940" style="s2">medicines in it so you that could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.810" end="00:58:23.070" style="s2">still good medicine for some people you</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.940" end="00:58:25.530" style="s2">just need additional things in your</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.070" end="00:58:29.010" style="s2">medicine bag transcending and including</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.530" end="00:58:31.110" style="s2">yes thank you yeah it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.010" end="00:58:32.970" style="s2">not good it&#39;s just that they tailored</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.110" end="00:58:36.740" style="s2">would again I am now you&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.970" end="00:58:41.880" style="s2">which of the tools practices you offer</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.740" end="00:58:44.250" style="s2">are supporting the people in general</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.880" end="00:58:46.020" style="s2">there&#39;s some practices meditations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.250" end="00:58:48.270" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t you don&#39;t have to even</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.020" end="00:58:51.840" style="s2">think of development sometimes you just</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.270" end="00:58:54.510" style="s2">can do it you can just be in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.840" end="00:58:56.550" style="s2">and have the peace and the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.510" end="00:59:00.120" style="s2">the expansiveness or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.550" end="00:59:01.140" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to communicate across the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.120" end="00:59:04.020" style="s2">board doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.140" end="00:59:07.470" style="s2">Ethan will take in what they play back</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.020" end="00:59:09.630" style="s2">off and I would even venture to guess I</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.470" end="00:59:12.060" style="s2">haven&#39;t measured it or seen the research</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.630" end="00:59:14.310" style="s2">but I&#39;m sure it would be that some</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.060" end="00:59:17.610" style="s2">people at earlier stages of middle</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.310" end="00:59:20.120" style="s2">stages have wonderful great depth in</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.610" end="00:59:22.290" style="s2">that we practice in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.120" end="00:59:25.380" style="s2">transcending and then coming back and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.290" end="00:59:28.770" style="s2">being you know they&#39;re ordinary cells</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.380" end="00:59:33.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re people work and more sustain</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.770" end="00:59:37.530" style="s2">that and generally later stages do tend</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.360" end="00:59:40.050" style="s2">to help in the sustainability of flow</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.530" end="00:59:42.840" style="s2">states as well because he have more if</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.050" end="00:59:46.680" style="s2">you will flexibility of control over</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.840" end="00:59:48.780" style="s2">what&#39;s actually going on yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.680" end="00:59:51.690" style="s2">well maybe the perception is different</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.780" end="00:59:54.780" style="s2">that you perceive things differently in</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.690" end="00:59:57.240" style="s2">a different stage right yes you do these</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.780" end="00:59:59.940" style="s2">are tell a different story and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.240" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">a piece I actually jumped over we make</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.940" end="01:00:05.670" style="s2">them really really I think it fought the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:07.350" style="s2">distinction between ego and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.670" end="01:00:09.930" style="s2">the word I mean we just don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.350" end="01:00:14.940" style="s2">better word and I use it because before</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.930" end="01:00:18.600" style="s2">on the Loranger my field my work use</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.940" end="01:00:19.670" style="s2">that word right the to use took it from</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.900" end="01:00:29.870" style="s2">of those tricky things because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.420" end="01:00:33.980" style="s2">man it&#39;s artificial choice but I say ego</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.870" end="01:00:38.360" style="s2">is that function in us that will always</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.980" end="01:00:41.210" style="s2">try to tell the coherent story no matter</p>

<p begin="01:00:41.210" end="01:00:46.610" style="s2">of others you can go in and insane</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.610" end="01:00:48.890" style="s2">enough asylum and listen to people what</p>

<p begin="01:05:33.370" end="01:05:38.290" style="s2">we&#39;re talking here about and that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.350" end="01:05:40.270" style="s2">of that struggle is defining the right</p>

<p begin="01:07:10.210" end="01:07:15.609" style="s2">is based on the scientific study is what</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.059" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">the current moment in the curve mass</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.609" end="01:07:22.359" style="s2">right and you try to use a different way</p>

<p begin="01:07:22.359" end="01:07:31.089" style="s2">going on then it is always just sort of</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.630" end="01:08:31.929" style="s2">so so what if if if whatever I thought I</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.750" end="01:08:34.900" style="s2">knew and was true now I&#39;m questioning it</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.929" end="01:08:37.929" style="s2">now I&#39;m realizing how many assumptions I</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.050" end="01:10:15.230" style="s2">still fairly prescriptive like go out</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.090" end="01:10:17.570" style="s2">and and give people a metaphor you</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.230" end="01:10:20.570" style="s2">listen to them and then you find one</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.570" end="01:10:23.690" style="s2">that matches them and then you give it</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.570" end="01:10:25.790" style="s2">you give it to them rather than the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.690" end="01:10:29.240" style="s2">interesting question I found really</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.790" end="01:10:32.120" style="s2">listen what kind of metaphors are moving</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.240" end="01:10:35.830" style="s2">that person and what behind the matter</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.120" end="01:10:39.640" style="s2">what does that actually mean to them</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.830" end="01:10:41.780" style="s2">that particular metaphor there and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.640" end="01:10:46.490" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m repeating myself</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.780" end="01:10:48.890" style="s2">but I can tell you the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.490" end="01:10:51.910" style="s2">experience I ever had with that was with</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.890" end="01:10:54.680" style="s2">an approach called clean language or</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.910" end="01:10:57.650" style="s2">symbolic modeling that I explored I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.680" end="01:11:00.950" style="s2">just curious about it until the teacher</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.650" end="01:11:03.260" style="s2">said well I can give you a free session</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.950" end="01:11:06.110" style="s2">you can just come and experience if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.260" end="01:11:08.690" style="s2">will better so I was telling them the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.110" end="01:11:11.930" style="s2">story of the powerful story in my life</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.690" end="01:11:15.470" style="s2">my mother died early I have a seriously</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.930" end="01:11:19.250" style="s2">retarded sister and all the sister and</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.110" end="01:11:39.560" style="s2">enormous burden and I felt and the way I</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.350" end="01:11:43.490" style="s2">described it was like a millstone around</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.560" end="01:11:46.040" style="s2">my neck I will not be able to move at my</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.490" end="01:11:48.380" style="s2">own speed and my own interests because</p>

<p begin="01:11:53.630" end="01:11:58.520" style="s2">experience of that so I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.490" end="01:12:02.090" style="s2">that and within an hour this whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.520" end="01:12:02.990" style="s2">the way just us there&#39;s a set of 20</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.090" end="01:12:05.360" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.990" end="01:12:07.430" style="s2">the coach is completely out of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.360" end="01:12:10.040" style="s2">picture there&#39;s nothing about the coach</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.430" end="01:12:13.790" style="s2">that still is only which question when</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.040" end="01:12:19.880" style="s2">to ask she got me to experience it as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.790" end="01:12:24.140" style="s2">life west same sayshe life west and we</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.880" end="01:12:29.570" style="s2">ended up it still moves me it was a</p>

<p begin="01:12:29.570" end="01:12:35.210" style="s2">powerful coaching has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.610" end="01:12:38.840" style="s2">levels that has to do with the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.210" end="01:12:41.990" style="s2">as a coach to completely step out of and</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.840" end="01:12:45.620" style="s2">only be curious what&#39;s in that personal</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.990" end="01:12:47.900" style="s2">they mean was those words he will have</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.620" end="01:12:50.630" style="s2">an idea with millstone around you make</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.900" end="01:12:53.210" style="s2">my team this is something entirely</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.630" end="01:12:55.010" style="s2">different what I meant and anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.210" end="01:12:57.200" style="s2">would mean because it was literally</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.010" end="01:13:00.110" style="s2">something different and it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.200" end="01:13:02.210" style="s2">happened their developmental or clothing</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.110" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">it changed if you&#39;re really in that</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.210" end="01:13:07.340" style="s2">sense it was transformational it changed</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">my relationship so that&#39;s and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.340" end="01:13:12.950" style="s2">nothing that says you can&#39;t do that kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:15.440" style="s2">of work with people as well I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.950" end="01:13:19.220" style="s2">it as a counterexample not everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.440" end="01:13:22.910" style="s2">has to be tailor coaching the powerful</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.220" end="01:13:25.820" style="s2">approaches that are not different depend</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.910" end="01:13:29.300" style="s2">on the level now the level of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.820" end="01:13:31.370" style="s2">of a person to actually work with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.300" end="01:13:34.760" style="s2">system like that probably has something</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.370" end="01:13:35.960" style="s2">to it I would have a hunch that not</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.760" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">everybody has</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.960" end="01:13:42.830" style="s2">transformative experience as I have it</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:46.370" style="s2">was an easy client if you will but still</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.830" end="01:13:49.310" style="s2">the technique itself he&#39;ll bring that</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.370" end="01:13:50.930" style="s2">forward that transformation one of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.310" end="01:13:56.690" style="s2">questions is behind this for me is how</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.930" end="01:13:58.570" style="s2">much if has developmental coaches there</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.690" end="01:14:02.300" style="s2">might there needs there&#39;s a need for</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.570" end="01:14:04.700" style="s2">distinguishing between the client need</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.300" end="01:14:10.030" style="s2">for horizontal growth versus vertical</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.700" end="01:14:13.070" style="s2">growth right so what you experienced was</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.030" end="01:14:17.600" style="s2">some expensiveness within your level of</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.070" end="01:14:20.630" style="s2">development horizontally or was it I</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.600" end="01:14:23.900" style="s2">don&#39;t even ask that question because my</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.630" end="01:14:26.930" style="s2">theory is of my experience is that when</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.900" end="01:14:31.130" style="s2">we help people be at home wherever they</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.930" end="01:14:34.250" style="s2">are more at all more more fully at home</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.130" end="01:14:38.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter which level more embedded</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.250" end="01:14:41.180" style="s2">more fitting to the environment then so</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.510" end="01:14:45.440" style="s2">much energy gets free that they will</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.180" end="01:14:47.870" style="s2">naturally find openings for vertical</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.440" end="01:14:50.690" style="s2">growth then it&#39;s much easier but if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.870" end="01:14:53.210" style="s2">start pulling somebody and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.690" end="01:14:55.640" style="s2">expecting them to grow vertically when</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.210" end="01:14:59.200" style="s2">they haven&#39;t even managed where they are</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.640" end="01:15:02.540" style="s2">at yeah then yes then you bit my case</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.200" end="01:15:05.480" style="s2">resistance which is an interesting word</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.540" end="01:15:10.489" style="s2">or you will just not need it may take</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.480" end="01:15:15.080" style="s2">many more sessions than necessary so</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.489" end="01:15:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that content so you have the</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.080" end="01:15:19.580" style="s2">innate capacity be happy</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:21.920" style="s2">therefore he you are able to reach to</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.580" end="01:15:26.060" style="s2">that point so in other words that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.920" end="01:15:27.489" style="s2">we already neatly intrinsically happy</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.060" end="01:15:30.560" style="s2">and at peace</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.489" end="01:15:33.050" style="s2">somehow because of that we have that</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.560" end="01:15:36.350" style="s2">capacity therefore you are coachable</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.050" end="01:15:39.940" style="s2">that you&#39;re able to be brought into that</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.350" end="01:15:43.670" style="s2">state but so let&#39;s make a distinguished</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.940" end="01:15:47.480" style="s2">distinction between state and stages I</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.670" end="01:15:48.989" style="s2">guess there is some you&#39;re earning I</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.480" end="01:15:53.099" style="s2">think we all have</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.989" end="01:15:55.469" style="s2">it has to be for happiness but for</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.099" end="01:15:57.300" style="s2">sensing when we&#39;re unhappy maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.469" end="01:15:59.730" style="s2">can&#39;t even name it we&#39;ll just feeling</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.300" end="01:16:03.900" style="s2">stress sister tells us something</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.730" end="01:16:05.940" style="s2">whatever became and define it so then</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.900" end="01:16:08.280" style="s2">they know that to me the first question</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.940" end="01:16:10.289" style="s2">is always how serious is that stress and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.280" end="01:16:12.929" style="s2">does it need more like therapy or</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.289" end="01:16:16.940" style="s2">medical attention or is it actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.929" end="01:16:19.650" style="s2">appropriate for a coaching relationship</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.940" end="01:16:22.710" style="s2">so I&#39;m just chatting I&#39;m doing rationing</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.650" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">the quality you know that yeah what</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.710" end="01:16:28.249" style="s2">human you know this this inequality the</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">innate quality I would say there is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.249" end="01:16:34.230" style="s2">obviously tendency to grow certainly to</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:37.139" style="s2">a certain level p-series say not</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.230" end="01:16:39.539" style="s2">everybody goes beyond the middle here or</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.139" end="01:16:41.760" style="s2">not even everybody that we just looked</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.539" end="01:16:46.670" style="s2">at it yesterday at the conference if</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.760" end="01:16:49.820" style="s2">they say 70% for people of any Western</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.670" end="01:16:53.429" style="s2">Western developed countries around here</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.820" end="01:16:55.860" style="s2">maybe 10 15 percent even earlier so we</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.429" end="01:16:59.309" style="s2">have very few that actually are over</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.860" end="01:17:01.800" style="s2">here and so the work we have to do is</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.309" end="01:17:04.050" style="s2">mostly with people at these levels in</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.800" end="01:17:08.639" style="s2">all situations and corporations</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.050" end="01:17:10.429" style="s2">individually the sort of vegetable crowd</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.639" end="01:17:13.980" style="s2">way where there many people</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.429" end="01:17:16.249" style="s2">self-identify later that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.980" end="01:17:16.249" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.849" end="01:17:30.289" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a distinction between to</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.099" end="01:17:32.610" style="s2">be made between the human world and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.289" end="01:17:35.460" style="s2">light world I don&#39;t even know if that</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.610" end="01:17:40.969" style="s2">means ok so it&#39;s like what your name was</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.460" end="01:17:40.969" style="s2">was like the light world the versus</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.349" end="01:17:47.429" style="s2">something that happens more in the human</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.820" end="01:17:49.230" style="s2">sphere well it basically language but I</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.429" end="01:17:51.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know I just threw it out there cuz</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.230" end="01:17:55.400" style="s2">it was just in my head I have n you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.480" end="01:17:55.400" style="s2">not trying to explore it a little more</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.900" end="01:18:02.079" style="s2">you mean the whole ecosystem acting</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.349" end="01:18:05.020" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.079" end="01:18:07.360" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to nuance the quality of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.020" end="01:18:11.139" style="s2">transformation without saying stated</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.360" end="01:18:13.389" style="s2">stages and moral tale of coaching and</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.139" end="01:18:16.650" style="s2">stuff like that like so now they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.389" end="01:18:19.630" style="s2">hiss and metal right there&#39;s like but I</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.650" end="01:18:21.429" style="s2">don&#39;t know how we try word and clean</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.630" end="01:18:25.150" style="s2">language person I would want to know</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.429" end="01:18:28.420" style="s2">what this actually holds some means you</p>

<p begin="01:22:46.140" end="01:22:50.820" style="s2">many ways you can say at earlier stages</p>

<p begin="01:22:57.480" end="01:23:02.220" style="s2">yourself then you could say well people</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.340" end="01:23:05.250" style="s2">have similar cognitive capacities</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.220" end="01:23:08.010" style="s2">like-minded then later on you even look</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.250" end="01:23:10.680" style="s2">for life spirited people that can be</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.010" end="01:23:12.870" style="s2">very diverse but with you really your</p>

<p begin="01:23:21.720" end="01:23:27.390" style="s2">together it&#39;s actually deeply</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.440" end="01:23:30.600" style="s2">descriptive of something again human</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.390" end="01:23:33.890" style="s2">yeah yes we can be generous yes we can</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.600" end="01:23:37.740" style="s2">be at a later stage and really really</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.890" end="01:23:40.710" style="s2">focused and willing and happy to serve</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.740" end="01:23:44.610" style="s2">all the labels but at some point we need</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.710" end="01:23:46.920" style="s2">some nourishment and support as well so</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.610" end="01:23:48.840" style="s2">the recommendation is always its own</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.920" end="01:23:51.690" style="s2">place through the length of your art</p>

<p begin="01:23:57.540" end="01:24:02.760" style="s2">we you know we can any development we</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.880" end="01:24:05.670" style="s2">can also describe the spiral the spiral</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.760" end="01:24:08.100" style="s2">is opening up there are fewer people and</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.670" end="01:24:10.470" style="s2">they&#39;re more ways of actually being at</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.100" end="01:24:14.100" style="s2">these latest stages than there are of</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.470" end="01:24:18.780" style="s2">the earlier ones so then people fall for</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.100" end="01:24:20.490" style="s2">common and describe that loneliness you</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.780" end="01:24:24.150" style="s2">know this kind of goes back to what you</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.490" end="01:24:27.630" style="s2">were saying about support yes our own</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.150" end="01:24:30.210" style="s2">development we absolutely need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.630" end="01:24:33.480" style="s2">monitor the work with these two firms</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.210" end="01:24:35.700" style="s2">working with the whole spectrum however</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.480" end="01:24:39.200" style="s2">that&#39;s defined and then also taking care</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.700" end="01:24:41.880" style="s2">of ourselves yes in all the way our own</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.200" end="01:24:43.170" style="s2">developmental needs and for Silas</p>

<p begin="01:24:59.489" end="01:25:08.159" style="s2">biological tribes but anyway it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.900" end="01:25:13.500" style="s2">to hear that because I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.159" end="01:25:15.750" style="s2">earlier about development and how there</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.500" end="01:25:18.090" style="s2">is the bias I&#39;m noticing in my own mind</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.750" end="01:25:24.800" style="s2">tor I want to get out there and do it</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.090" end="01:25:28.290" style="s2">you know but whether it&#39;s my out myself</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.800" end="01:25:30.659" style="s2">or working with someone else I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.290" end="01:25:32.719" style="s2">hearing the way that he first what</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.659" end="01:25:36.900" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and how you&#39;re saying I</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.719" end="01:25:37.619" style="s2">just feel so again it&#39;s just slow to</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.900" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.619" end="01:25:45.300" style="s2">not that I&#39;m anyway but just listen and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:49.770" style="s2">development is an innate thing like</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.300" end="01:25:52.590" style="s2">you&#39;re saying pick up and the agenda but</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.770" end="01:25:55.170" style="s2">it&#39;s totally relax and take the time to</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.590" end="01:25:57.210" style="s2">really get to talk to the individual and</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.170" end="01:25:59.850" style="s2">just listener to find out who they are</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.210" end="01:26:03.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the question who are you want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.850" end="01:26:05.489" style="s2">see I say it even differently what is it</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.030" end="01:26:08.250" style="s2">like to be you what is it like to be</p>

<p begin="01:26:13.469" end="01:26:19.139" style="s2">be you and I think one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.570" end="01:26:22.440" style="s2">healing things for human beings is to be</p>

<p begin="01:26:29.820" end="01:26:34.679" style="s2">compliment but maybe is the best</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.760" end="01:26:38.900" style="s2">compliment that I can receive as a coach</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.679" end="01:26:42.630" style="s2">is when someone says that they felt</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.900" end="01:26:45.420" style="s2">maybe for the first time fully seen and</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.630" end="01:26:46.679" style="s2">heard yes if you don&#39;t forget what we</p>

<p begin="01:26:46.679" end="01:26:50.880" style="s2">you know that&#39;s how to do that too but</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.360" end="01:26:54.119" style="s2">they said they felt seen and heard</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.880" end="01:26:55.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a big deal you know I think we</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.119" end="01:26:56.820" style="s2">all from the other end of the I like</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.800" end="01:27:01.530" style="s2">feeling</p>

<p begin="01:27:01.530" end="01:27:07.310" style="s2">begin will not with the idea that were</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.290" end="01:27:11.280" style="s2">separate individuals in the skin back</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.310" end="01:27:14.280" style="s2">you know how how what a foolish idea</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.280" end="01:27:17.490" style="s2">that is but here this level there is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.280" end="01:27:20.240" style="s2">good sense that that soul with all the</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.490" end="01:27:24.360" style="s2">scientific knowledge I may have that I</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.240" end="01:27:28.170" style="s2">have more bacteria my gut and there are</p>

<p begin="01:27:28.170" end="01:27:33.600" style="s2">of external knowledge it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.120" end="01:27:37.620" style="s2">actually affect this level my sense of</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.600" end="01:27:40.410" style="s2">self that there&#39;s no boundary just I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:27:41.250" end="01:27:48.380" style="s2">yeah you know the separate self that was</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.240" end="01:27:52.110" style="s2">so central to Western ideas about life</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.380" end="01:27:55.560" style="s2">he&#39;s so limited so here starts the</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.110" end="01:27:57.840" style="s2">boundary starts to be deconstructed so</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.560" end="01:28:00.140" style="s2">we say this is the construction of a</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.840" end="01:28:03.390" style="s2">separate self and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.140" end="01:28:05.790" style="s2">deconstruction stepwise first you just</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.390" end="01:28:08.190" style="s2">notice that the same reality can be</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.790" end="01:28:11.300" style="s2">looked at from many different ways and</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.190" end="01:28:15.150" style="s2">interpreted in many many different ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.300" end="01:28:18.360" style="s2">that the second level of construction is</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.150" end="01:28:20.430" style="s2">not just that there is one reality we</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.360" end="01:28:23.870" style="s2">can look at in many many different ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.430" end="01:28:26.430" style="s2">they&#39;re actually innumerable realities</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.870" end="01:28:29.930" style="s2">because they&#39;re all based on a unique</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.430" end="01:28:34.590" style="s2">work on the pattern of language and</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.930" end="01:28:37.140" style="s2">using words to describe reality but</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.590" end="01:28:40.980" style="s2">they&#39;re all individually flavored as</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.140" end="01:28:43.880" style="s2">welcome from our history our singing so</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.980" end="01:28:46.970" style="s2">here this is a much deeper kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.880" end="01:28:49.650" style="s2">uncertainty this we call relative</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.970" end="01:28:53.520" style="s2">everything is relative yes but here is</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.650" end="01:29:00.800" style="s2">even more profound there&#39;s no place to</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.520" end="01:29:05.070" style="s2">stand on it&#39;s all the tension between I</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.800" end="01:29:09.140" style="s2">think Pascal said it best in his own</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.070" end="01:29:09.140" style="s2">saying is Adam in his thoughts</p>

<p begin="01:29:12.870" end="01:29:18.960" style="s2">a while ago yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.300" end="01:29:33.690" style="s2">if teens maybe even and they were always</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.960" end="01:29:36.210" style="s2">coffee switch well anyway the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.690" end="01:29:39.330" style="s2">I got from him that struck me in high</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.210" end="01:29:57.180" style="s2">school I was just dumbfounded it changed</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.330" end="01:29:59.040" style="s2">my life I do know it&#39;s a possibility to</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.180" end="01:30:02.790" style="s2">store it&#39;s another story that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.040" end="01:30:05.610" style="s2">helpfulness on people it&#39;s fine well you</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.790" end="01:30:07.949" style="s2">got it was like what do you say well we</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.610" end="01:30:11.219" style="s2">have to read this stuff from Bosco say</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.949" end="01:30:14.640" style="s2">human beings prepared to nothingness on</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.219" end="01:30:18.090" style="s2">everything and human beings compared to</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.640" end="01:30:19.710" style="s2">everything or the nothingness and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.090" end="01:30:22.710" style="s2">teacher actually gave us the</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.710" end="01:30:25.170" style="s2">mathematical transcription of that one</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.710" end="01:30:27.810" style="s2">compared to zero is an infinity or</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.170" end="01:30:30.930" style="s2">course two it&#39;s infinity on compared to</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.810" end="01:30:34.469" style="s2">an infinity goes to it&#39;s zero as you</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.930" end="01:30:38.820" style="s2">know mathematical thing and it</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.469" end="01:30:42.270" style="s2">completely completely just did oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.820" end="01:30:45.530" style="s2">yes that&#39;s the tension I feel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.270" end="01:30:50.580" style="s2">that not finding a place to stand</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.530" end="01:30:55.250" style="s2">because I&#39;m aware of both and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.580" end="01:30:58.440" style="s2">a later stage kind of uncertainty and he</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.250" end="01:31:03.150" style="s2">really and Wilbur says that well also it</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.440" end="01:31:04.949" style="s2">doesn&#39;t often point to it is you suffer</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.150" end="01:31:10.050" style="s2">just as much it&#39;s not that you get</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.949" end="01:31:15.510" style="s2">happier with every level but it bothers</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.050" end="01:31:17.730" style="s2">you list because because of what what do</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.510" end="01:31:20.730" style="s2">people like the state just have the</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.730" end="01:31:22.949" style="s2">early stages do not have perspective</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.730" end="01:31:25.560" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.949" end="01:31:29.640" style="s2">in the resources that&#39;s not gonna deal</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.560" end="01:31:33.719" style="s2">with you go yes more capacity to you</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.640" end="01:31:35.400" style="s2">know honesty and straightforwardly look</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.719" end="01:31:38.580" style="s2">at reality and that their own</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.400" end="01:31:41.100" style="s2">shortcomings and the way the mind plays</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.580" end="01:31:43.860" style="s2">tricks on us and accepting that we all</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.100" end="01:31:46.350" style="s2">have biases no matter how hard we try</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.860" end="01:31:48.540" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all of them are hardwired all</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.350" end="01:31:50.370" style="s2">of that we&#39;re just curiosity coming</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.540" end="01:31:54.120" style="s2">because like you can&#39;t really carry that</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.370" end="01:31:56.190" style="s2">about you know because you have a</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.120" end="01:32:03.110" style="s2">perspective on the unhappiness or the</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.190" end="01:32:07.080" style="s2">sadness or the thing it becomes like</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.110" end="01:32:09.060" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating you know it&#39;s equally</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.080" end="01:32:10.290" style="s2">fast in the fascination in the ah</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.060" end="01:32:14.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.290" end="01:32:15.989" style="s2">so that&#39;s like a perspective on it I</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.370" end="01:32:18.239" style="s2">don&#39;t know where you&#39;re at I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.989" end="01:32:22.410" style="s2">where you&#39;re standing from when you have</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.239" end="01:32:25.290" style="s2">that perspective but a kind of radical</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.410" end="01:32:28.260" style="s2">openness I would say and finding</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.290" end="01:32:30.540" style="s2">precisely the in-between and the tension</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.260" end="01:32:32.850" style="s2">between the two like walking on the edge</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.540" end="01:32:36.780" style="s2">of a salt that&#39;s where it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.850" end="01:32:39.179" style="s2">juicy footing for truly truly curious</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.780" end="01:32:41.730" style="s2">about what life is but to me that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.179" end="01:32:45.390" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s just all the</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.730" end="01:32:50.219" style="s2">curiosity like I think there&#39;s a moment</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.390" end="01:32:53.699" style="s2">of I might get in trouble but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.219" end="01:32:56.760" style="s2">moment of non feet just not curious</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.699" end="01:33:01.890" style="s2">there is no curiosity and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.760" end="01:33:04.050" style="s2">about the awareness of no self now if</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.890" end="01:33:09.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment where there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.050" end="01:33:14.790" style="s2">no no thing including curiosity but then</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.770" end="01:33:17.929" style="s2">curiosity definitely happens but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.790" end="01:33:20.160" style="s2">a moment just before and I think also</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.929" end="01:33:23.429" style="s2">none of what we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.160" end="01:33:26.400" style="s2">about being static but it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.429" end="01:33:29.790" style="s2">fluid economic fluid in and out that</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.400" end="01:33:32.460" style="s2">even states we even do my regular days</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.790" end="01:33:35.520" style="s2">we go through States every night you go</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.460" end="01:33:36.180" style="s2">through states this is also part of our</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.520" end="01:33:39.990" style="s2">birth</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.180" end="01:33:42.360" style="s2">right if you will but there is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.990" end="01:33:45.000" style="s2">difference when we talk about growing up</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.360" end="01:33:48.330" style="s2">and waking up waking up has a different</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.000" end="01:33:53.100" style="s2">titles a different target than growing</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.330" end="01:33:56.400" style="s2">up and I would be kind of happy can we</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.100" end="01:33:57.890" style="s2">talk about something that oh did I</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.400" end="01:34:02.640" style="s2">interrupt you I&#39;m always interrupting</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.890" end="01:34:04.740" style="s2">okay I think one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.640" end="01:34:07.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know I just popped in but like one</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.740" end="01:34:14.280" style="s2">of the things that people that I work</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.290" end="01:34:16.170" style="s2">with have trouble with is like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.280" end="01:34:19.200" style="s2">been talking about about unity and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.170" end="01:34:24.140" style="s2">all one and and I want to overemphasize</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.200" end="01:34:29.130" style="s2">that but then people start to get very</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.140" end="01:34:31.110" style="s2">aware of how unique they are and at</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.130" end="01:34:34.590" style="s2">first like for long time they might be</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.110" end="01:34:35.940" style="s2">in these you know unique self courses or</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.590" end="01:34:38.490" style="s2">something I think it&#39;s a really cool</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.940" end="01:34:40.470" style="s2">idea then all of a sudden they start to</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.490" end="01:34:44.120" style="s2">really experience I&#39;m unique they are</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.470" end="01:34:49.200" style="s2">well we did this in our retreat yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.120" end="01:34:51.330" style="s2">they end up being what it hits them and</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.200" end="01:34:54.570" style="s2">then they really cannot tease them you</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.330" end="01:34:56.880" style="s2">know like well like well you see people</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.570" end="01:34:58.620" style="s2">are really afraid that that most of</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.880" end="01:35:00.870" style="s2">their experience is not shared that that</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.620" end="01:35:02.940" style="s2">actually are they all of a sudden they</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.870" end="01:35:06.000" style="s2">realize how unique they are the other</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.940" end="01:35:08.490" style="s2">side of it and they get terrified right</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.000" end="01:35:10.590" style="s2">because it&#39;s an obligation if you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.490" end="01:35:12.740" style="s2">how unique your then you have to live</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.590" end="01:35:17.580" style="s2">your unique self and that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.740" end="01:35:19.230" style="s2">imitation right so there&#39;s like toggle</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.580" end="01:35:21.150" style="s2">between people just you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.230" end="01:35:22.440" style="s2">people are in these communities chasing</p>

<p begin="01:35:22.440" end="01:35:26.040" style="s2">conventional and they&#39;re all doing the</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.210" end="01:35:28.980" style="s2">ritual stuff and then then there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.980" end="01:35:33.390" style="s2">and our retreat and people are like oh</p>

<p begin="01:35:33.390" end="01:35:38.880" style="s2">because of these want to really get it</p>

<p begin="01:35:41.040" end="01:35:44.940" style="s2">again more likely to happen up here</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.050" end="01:35:49.219" style="s2">because there&#39;s more resources more</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.940" end="01:35:52.290" style="s2">capacity to watch what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.219" end="01:35:54.360" style="s2">but it could happen here too I mean sir</p>

<p begin="01:35:56.550" end="01:36:01.469" style="s2">coaching a little bit about purpose</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.100" end="01:36:03.630" style="s2">what&#39;s your purpose down here the</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.469" end="01:36:05.790" style="s2">purpose is usually you know what you</p>

<p begin="01:36:05.790" end="01:36:11.010" style="s2">choose and later here the purpose is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.489" end="01:36:13.980" style="s2">much more deeper one that is attached to</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.010" end="01:36:16.440" style="s2">what is your unique give you that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.980" end="01:36:19.380" style="s2">have been given and how are you going to</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.440" end="01:36:23.100" style="s2">translate that in service of others and</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.380" end="01:36:25.590" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s not either/or that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:36:25.590" end="01:36:29.670" style="s2">other switch that happens all your life</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.630" end="01:36:31.800" style="s2">you realize you&#39;ve taken pink and pink</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.670" end="01:36:34.860" style="s2">and pink in the Earth&#39;s even people been</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.800" end="01:36:38.310" style="s2">given and all of a sudden then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.860" end="01:36:40.230" style="s2">switch right and that comes with it that</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.310" end="01:36:42.750" style="s2">first is terrified and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.230" end="01:36:46.110" style="s2">some of that has to do with personality</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.750" end="01:36:49.100" style="s2">but like I said curiosity is clearly one</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.110" end="01:36:52.469" style="s2">of the ways if you want the of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.100" end="01:36:55.980" style="s2">intelligences or of different people of</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.469" end="01:36:58.199" style="s2">different temperament some of us you and</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.980" end="01:37:01.949" style="s2">I we know that they&#39;re talked about it</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.199" end="01:37:04.350" style="s2">that just immensely curious and that is</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.949" end="01:37:07.020" style="s2">probably something that compels people</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.350" end="01:37:10.050" style="s2">more likely to it&#39;s exploring and</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.020" end="01:37:12.420" style="s2">experimenting and asking fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.050" end="01:37:16.890" style="s2">questions then somebody who is naturally</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.420" end="01:37:20.330" style="s2">not so curious it&#39;s a paradox isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.890" end="01:37:23.190" style="s2">unique in the unitive yes well there</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.330" end="01:37:25.260" style="s2">because there are you there are things</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.190" end="01:37:27.600" style="s2">we have all in common we all tell</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.260" end="01:37:31.290" style="s2">stories no matter what culture what</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.600" end="01:37:34.130" style="s2">group they&#39;re coming for we all know to</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.290" end="01:37:37.260" style="s2">some degree we born within for life</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.130" end="01:37:43.770" style="s2">usually let&#39;s assume we have one life</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.260" end="01:37:46.199" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna die the question is then</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.770" end="01:37:50.699" style="s2">what is that which that recognize the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.199" end="01:37:55.219" style="s2">uniqueness what is that and is that we</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.699" end="01:37:55.219" style="s2">all have a soul</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.519" end="01:38:00.800" style="s2">okay where&#39;s all the self-awareness this</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.309" end="01:38:04.639" style="s2">stepping outside of that observing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.800" end="01:38:07.239" style="s2">that I&#39;m just also experience to realize</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.639" end="01:38:09.650" style="s2">where you are different in a unique</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.239" end="01:38:13.489" style="s2">unique is an interesting way where you</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.650" end="01:38:15.320" style="s2">are different than anybody else and what</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.489" end="01:38:17.480" style="s2">which you can sometimes there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.320" end="01:38:20.719" style="s2">than one difference you could recognize</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.480" end="01:38:25.400" style="s2">but what is it specifically that would</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.719" end="01:38:28.670" style="s2">have the most impact I guess would be</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.400" end="01:38:30.679" style="s2">the world will be the most useful and</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.670" end="01:38:33.769" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s a guess you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.679" end="01:38:36.409" style="s2">know you can&#39;t know beforehand right</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.769" end="01:38:38.179" style="s2">yeah I keep you gotta go it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.409" end="01:38:40.489" style="s2">like I look at you you look closer and</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.179" end="01:38:43.550" style="s2">closer and closer and you know that</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.489" end="01:38:46.610" style="s2">eventually you see everything migrate</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.550" end="01:38:48.559" style="s2">like you&#39;re pure spotting a spot and</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.610" end="01:38:50.119" style="s2">you&#39;re looking deeply into it and study</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.559" end="01:38:51.679" style="s2">and being within and eventually it</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.119" end="01:38:56.420" style="s2">becomes like everything there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.679" end="01:38:58.639" style="s2">it&#39;s like I think about this often it</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.420" end="01:39:03.190" style="s2">was like I can&#39;t distinguish identity</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.639" end="01:39:05.480" style="s2">and purpose and if I go once I if I go</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.190" end="01:39:07.579" style="s2">too much to the side and what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.480" end="01:39:09.800" style="s2">purpose then I start feeling like a</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.579" end="01:39:12.380" style="s2">failure because Anderson Cooper tonight</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.800" end="01:39:15.320" style="s2">interviewing me on CNN and then I</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.380" end="01:39:17.769" style="s2">realized I&#39;ve gotten away from the</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.320" end="01:39:21.530" style="s2">questions of the self with a capital S</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.769" end="01:39:25.960" style="s2">so I then I know I had to slow down when</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.530" end="01:39:30.170" style="s2">I go into I&#39;m supposed to do this but</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.960" end="01:39:31.909" style="s2">and yet when I when things are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.170" end="01:39:34.190" style="s2">like this and what you were doing Bonnie</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.909" end="01:39:37.190" style="s2">but things are working that way my sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.190" end="01:39:42.739" style="s2">of self and flow of purpose seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.190" end="01:39:46.340" style="s2">effortless and not not at question</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.739" end="01:39:49.190" style="s2">either but not always but no but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.340" end="01:39:52.010" style="s2">we call that simple kind of way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.190" end="01:39:54.170" style="s2">finished even the flow then you lose</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.010" end="01:39:55.010" style="s2">your sense to time off you lose your</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.170" end="01:39:58.909" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.010" end="01:40:01.849" style="s2">set itself but that time you we also</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.909" end="01:40:03.679" style="s2">function that are based on our training</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.849" end="01:40:07.610" style="s2">through programs we do that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.679" end="01:40:09.349" style="s2">exercise we do is say draw what does it</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.610" end="01:40:12.619" style="s2">look like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.349" end="01:40:18.409" style="s2">at your face what image do you have for</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.619" end="01:40:22.550" style="s2">that yeah and that&#39;s really tapping into</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.409" end="01:40:25.159" style="s2">the flow what is it when and you will</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.550" end="01:40:27.290" style="s2">again see when we do it we could do it</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.159" end="01:40:30.349" style="s2">right now actually I&#39;m totally lost time</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.290" end="01:40:36.139" style="s2">so since we have any of you fun do we</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.349" end="01:40:40.820" style="s2">have any time anybody need a bridge two</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.139" end="01:40:44.980" style="s2">o&#39;clock I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not was running</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.820" end="01:40:52.040" style="s2">this we start around three something yes</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.980" end="01:40:55.099" style="s2">455 yes but I could imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.040" end="01:40:58.810" style="s2">somebody might need it quick key great</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.099" end="01:41:01.460" style="s2">let&#39;s take a break but just sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.810" end="01:41:01.940" style="s2">just a bio break is what they call</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.460" end="01:41:12.679" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.940" end="01:41:16.730" style="s2">yes see you when you&#39;re on your break us</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.679" end="01:41:20.150" style="s2">or ask or grapple with in the next</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.730" end="01:41:23.469" style="s2">half-hour or so just be careful what you</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.150" end="01:41:23.469" style="s2">say because the recording still on</p>
