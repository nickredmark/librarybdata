<p begin="00:01:36.640" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">because the plan is to leave the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">two sessions</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:45.040" style="s2">as something like a practicum where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">issues from our lives or from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">and we have a little bit more discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">and try to apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">the metapsychology so that&#39;s my hope so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be like drinking from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">fire hose again today where i just run</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">through the slides and kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">lay a bunch of things out um i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">to try to go through</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">a little bit of a rehearsal last time</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">and then move through each of the three</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">modalities of the psyche so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">insolent development transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">and try to talk about how they weave</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">together uh so let me get the screen</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">sharing going here</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">so let&#39;s do this again just to rehearse</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">where we were um so you&#39;ll remember it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">we did a journey through the birth and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">history of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">after realizing that the issue of psyche</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">was rebrute to the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">metacrisis kind of went over a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">bit of like my existential angst in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">when i discovered just what a mess the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">field of psychology was as a science</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">and then my first attempts to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">charles sanders purses</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">metaphysics to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">kind of rescue psychology from itself to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">build a metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">that serves as a mediator between</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">metaphysics and the sciences of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">right so that&#39;s the place where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">playing is in metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">which isn&#39;t the science of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s critiquing it and norming</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">but nor is it metaphysics it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">and so that meta psychology move that i</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">just made happens in other fields too</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">and if you look at interdisciplinary uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.360" style="s2">research which is to say the people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">reflect on the practices of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.360" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">interdisciplinarity</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that yeah if you reach the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">high end of like biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">you get into something like metabiology</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:57.480" style="s2">and if you reach the high end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">sociology you get into</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.480" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">meta-sociology and many of those meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">disciplines which bridge philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">metaphysics and the discipline itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">many of them have commonalities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where you get this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">move towards consilience in the space of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">knowledge construction so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">attempt to build a metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">off of purse but of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">especially with landry and so by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">two or three years ago i returned to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">as a focus i had a better</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">grasp of how that tripartite metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">metapsychology psychology thing could</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">so this is what i&#39;m presenting so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">transcendence and soulmate development</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">is my characterization of these deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">uh kind of meta theoretical and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">metaphysical distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">that are that are around so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">recall</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">i broke these down into the different</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">triads within them language cognition</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">capacity as a set</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">involved with development which captures</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">a whole range of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">disciplines including developmental</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">psychology cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">etc uh insolent image imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">personality which captures usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">what&#39;s called depth psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">but particularly encapsulating more of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">union and even artistic and aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">of that element of psyche</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">and then transcendence symbol attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">here you also find uh formal</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">psychological sciences especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">affective neuroscience uh the study of</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">altered states things of that nature but</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">you find also where religion and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">come together um especially in ritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">symbol and uh transcendent consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s the set and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">this encapsulates</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">everything that kind of wants to call</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">itself the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">science of psychology kind of organizes</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">it and then allows us to see</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">that the psyche is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">polysemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">which means it has multiple meanings and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">lends itself to analysis from all three</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">angles at all times</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">which means like if any paid give me any</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">and i can look at it from developmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">perspective an installment perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">or a transcendence perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">and if you are behaving in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re behaving well</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">which is to say that it is a net</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">generative to your own</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">future growth and learning and positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">uh all three of these are happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">your behavior in a certain way which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like saying like your whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">brain your</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">whole brain is actually involved in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">every behavior</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">so the whole psyche is actually involved</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">in every behavior</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">so this is where it gets kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">interesting because when you look across</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">these three</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">you will find that there are this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">where the metaphysics comes in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">deeper patterns that show up across all</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">and this is an example now stages and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">stations and phases are distinct</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">because they don&#39;t work in exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">same way but they&#39;re also similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">because they involve this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">rolling over and moving into</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">uh and having certain spaces that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">are containment and stability</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">so in the state place of stages where</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">you&#39;re residing at a stage</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">and then some kind of shift to another</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">way of operating</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">and that happens in stations as well and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">it happens in phases</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">so you got to see how these are like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">similar the underlying thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">metaphysically is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">uh what bhaskar called basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">what landry would call the axiom2</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:58.879" style="s2">rotation</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s a common underlying pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.879" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s very important to see how</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">they&#39;re different uh so as i move</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">through each of these later</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">i&#39;ll talk more about what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:10.319" style="s2">differences between stages and stations</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">and phases is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.319" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">here i&#39;m just saying that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">something that all three of these do</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s that they transform they</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">transform through a rhythmic</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">identifiable pattern</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">they also interrelate um this is another</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">example of an axiom two</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">rotation um from landry&#39;s imminent</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">uh so as i described last time this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">like an ooda loop</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">this is also like the circular reaction</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">which was this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">kind of basic early conception in</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">psychology that dewey and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">james and others toyed with the basic</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">idea is that installment the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">personality you get a motivation</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">you get an image of this situation</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">you&#39;re in and yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">and then that basically propels</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">development because the image is always</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">a problematic the image always has</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">required action required so you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">have capacity</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">actualize so you move into development</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">objectify the world build the skill</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">necessary and then part of you somehow</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">acts choice right</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">transcendence is not otherworldly</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">transcendence is actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">like where the body is it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">as an uncaused cause in the causal chain</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">it&#39;s about the power of choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">but also putting insolent and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">in view both of them which means it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">a dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">uh witness or distance</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">in any case and then once you&#39;ve chosen</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">enacted then the personality is back and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the image is the image changed</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">have i became who i thought i would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">from the action</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">has it worked am i have i resolved the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">or have i fixed the problem um</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">and then it repeats right if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">working well</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">then this thing really becomes auto</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">catalytic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">psychic evolution structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">so as i mentioned last time this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">review still</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">uh all four quadrants are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">which means that moving through</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">developmental stages is an all-quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">fair</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">moving through stations of insolent is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">an all-quadrant affair</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">moving through phases of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">is also in all quadrant affair so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">not like</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">they do kind of correspond with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like one of them means this</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">is this quadrant and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">in fact they&#39;re all in all quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">affair which is key and they all</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">as i mentioned have these underlying</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">dynamics which are deeper and have to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">nonlinearity phase shift chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">complexity dynamics which means that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">there&#39;s uh there&#39;s nothing in this that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">mechanistic um and a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">is organismic</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">in the white hedian sense and i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">to get in more into that when i get into</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">development in particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">so as i said they have commonalities as</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">just now the quadrants the dynamics the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">underlying metaphysical triples</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">but there&#39;s also distinct content form</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">and process</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where we get into like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">cognition uses</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">language and semiotics of symbol</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">and objective frames etcetera you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">insolent uses image</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">right transcendence has awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">symbol</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">so you&#39;ll see there&#39;s differences too um</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">and here&#39;s where it gets kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">interesting is that they co-arise</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">they mutually enmesh and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">reciprocally enable and the reciprocally</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">enabling is interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">one important dynamic that i&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">so you&#39;re moving around from installment</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">through development to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">transcendence when you reach certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">stages of development and it kicks</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">and comes back to installment you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">actually open</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">the door to stations of insolent</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">through the actualizations of stages of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">right so uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">an example of that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">if you are pursuing the vocation of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">healer like a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">or an herbalist or something of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">nature um</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">and you acquire a certain capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">in development you have the languages of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">it the cognition involved in making</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">considered judgments and diagnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">you become</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">capacity in that way you&#39;ve now opened</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">the door to go through the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">installment process</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">that is possible when you take on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">responsibility of being a doctor healer</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">right you can&#39;t go through that&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">stations</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">of like the wounded healer and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">moving into the like</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">light of god type healing stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">none of that starts to happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">unless you&#39;ve built the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">capacity to step into the space of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">actually being</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">that person same with certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">certain forms of teaching</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">certain forms of science and scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">so the notion that moving through</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">certain levels getting certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">capacities can then open the door to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">certain stations</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">is interesting uh similarly stations</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">that are more let&#39;s say primordial to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:37.040" style="s2">the deeper image of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">those will set the rudder for certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.040" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">types of developmental things to come</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">some people at a very early age it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">clear that music</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">music is like in their soul right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">then that prints</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">them towards a certain kind of stage</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">development in</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">kinesthetic musical aesthetic dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:01.839" style="s2">so you can see this intermeshing</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">intertwining and i could we have similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">stories about</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">transcendence where certain states of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">consciousness become readily available</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">make it easier to move through</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">certain stages right so you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">how all of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">moves together and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">complexity which is like implicit in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">model which would take a long time for</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">me to actually speak to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">but there&#39;s a whole kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">grid-like structure there</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">so and then as we talk about the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">dimensions especially when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.199" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">him at the level of language of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">insolent transcendent development</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">to be careful i will always make</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">mistakes in doing this but we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">careful</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">uh these things aren&#39;t within the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not like parts of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">like a functionalist</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">model and they&#39;re also not structures</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">technically</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">i like to think about them as basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">primordial</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">categories in terms of which the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">understands itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">so these are part of the psyches</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">relationship with itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">and therefore its relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">other quote unquote psyches which is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">say you and me</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">i and thou so it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">emerged from that dimension of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s move through</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">let&#39;s move through each of the three</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">um and as i move through i&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">making meta commentary of how they</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">interact interrelate or at least</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">i&#39;m intending to do that so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll be good to my own attention</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">all right so there&#39;s uh when we move</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">into the domain of installment i like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">with installment but you can start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">any of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">the reason i start with in solomon is</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">because it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">the most imminent it&#39;s the one that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">you could argue kind of like begins</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">when the process has a beginning it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">begins from</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">who you are right begins from the root</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">metaphors or archetypes in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">which you understand yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">and the world uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">so james hillman is kind of the key</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">person here and the term insolent is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">never fed so much helmet i couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">that actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">term and uses the word soul making um</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">researchers in the space bedroom is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">definitely the leader um</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">you know ran the jung institute for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">while uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">met jung on his death bed um uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:40.079" style="s2">deeply transformed the field of depth</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">psychology both in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.079" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">criticizing the practice of psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">psychology as a like a medical</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">biomedical discipline</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">and also changing the stream of union</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">depth psychology uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">into something that became as flexible</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">kind of flexible deeply powerful um</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">set of frames so i&#39;m a big fan of helmet</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">work a lot of what i&#39;m saying here is</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">just coming from</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">from hill and i&#39;ll try to mention some</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">books along the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">so image imagination personality and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">stations right so this is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">that play</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">in insolent and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">so the key dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">uh let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">growth or deepening</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">that takes place here uh is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">characterized by jung basically in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:45.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">emotional maturity or individualization</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.039" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">uh it&#39;s also posited as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">maslow&#39;s developmental uh model</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:59.919" style="s2">so you have to get that many</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">much psychology that&#39;s gone on uh has</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.919" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">put a couple of these in the triple</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">so like maslow&#39;s development</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">developmental model and some</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">ego psychology models like lavender</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">actually blend in solvent and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">development together which isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">problem i&#39;m trying to differentiate them</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">a little bit for</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">clarity but ego development and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">maslow&#39;s model and some other ones blend</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">them together but there&#39;s elements of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">maslow&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">that gets that are station-like and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">work with the image of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">self and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">so to even begin to move through this we</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">need to clarify what do we mean by an</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">and what do we mean by a station so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">going to set down some terminology and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">then that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">free the conversation up so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s a picture of a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">symbols are extremely powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">they&#39;re extremely universal</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">and they are attached basically to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">this modality of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">focusing of awareness and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">impersonal element where i actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">kind of de-identify with the local ego</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">and identify with the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">beyond so that&#39;s kind of an important</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">difference i&#39;m going to move between</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s a painting of an image</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">right jotto uh one of the very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">uh people to use what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">modern perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">um so you can see that within the image</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">so let&#39;s say i have a dream and i have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">dream that&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:42.559" style="s2">reconstruction of the crucifixion it</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">looks a little bit like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.559" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">within the dream i can extract a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">and this is a lot of what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">dream analysis and psychology you have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">dream there&#39;s a cross</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">in it and i say ah the universal symbol</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">see your dream points you beyond</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">to something universal right</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">but what you&#39;re neglecting are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">details of the image</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">and actually the uniqueness of the image</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">because if i have a dream about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">crucifixion</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">it&#39;s likely that either i&#39;m on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">or i&#39;m somewhere in here as a character</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">right so like look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">the guy on the right who&#39;s with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">romans presumably who has one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">halos over his head</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">like that would be an interesting dude</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">to be in this image if i knew more about</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">christian uh someone probably knows who</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">that is here on the calls to put it in</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">the chat but i&#39;m sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">a identifiable guy and then the angels</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">like look at the angels who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">tormented the one on the right below</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">jesus&#39;s armpit exposes his chest</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">in in turmoil so like the richness and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">the detail of the image is where the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">image is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">at like that&#39;s the point of the image so</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">it can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">relieving if you&#39;re overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">the complexity of your own image of self</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">it can be relieving to find the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">universal symbol in it which identifies</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">you with the transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">which gets you out of the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">the omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">trying to understand developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the image and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">torture and the tragedy of the image</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">pull out the cross and boom you&#39;ve moved</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:17.440" style="s2">your attention has switched</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">phase shift and emotion and you see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.440" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">transcendent right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">a lot of what&#39;s useful to do in dream</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">work but for helmand</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">and i would say from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">insolent</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">the idea is to actually linger and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">deepen within the power</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">and unicity uniqueness of the image</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">so here&#39;s another image right this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">the return of persephone</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s hermes who who&#39;s rescuing</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">persephone</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">from hades returning to demeter</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">uh her mother um incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">but you have to get that an image is</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">always has a context</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">a setting and a mood so not all pictures</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">are images</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">images are mythogens or</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">i can&#39;t i don&#39;t know how to say that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">it means basically means like fragment</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">of a myth</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">and uh so this one&#39;s powerful right</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">i mean the gesture of openness like</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">demeter looking like a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">christ there on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">uh but then the proneness of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">persephone&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">um the composure of hermes uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">the plant down in the lower left</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">likely to be aconite which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">grew from the saliva of cyborus the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">three-headed dog</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">at the door of hades is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">incredibly poison</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">no it&#39;s my wife mag and she identified</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">in this image so there&#39;s richness to an</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">image a uniqueness to the image</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">which you don&#39;t want to so what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">could do here is you could say ah the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">the mother right you could extract the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">mother archetype</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">into the realm of symbol from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">richness and unicity</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">of that right or you could do it with</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">any other figures in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">right and so i&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">but i&#39;m saying that&#39;s not the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">to do with image you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">move to the impersonal universal</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">symbol or you can stay and clarify the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">uniqueness and clarify the uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">the image itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">um so this from one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">movies</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">uh the fountain by darren arnovski</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">uh so this is another potent image like</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">a fragment of a myth</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">and you don&#39;t even need to know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">whole story here but there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">complexity within the moving parts here</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">that you can describe it in this crazily</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.159" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">textured imaged way so right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">i stand at the edge of my world a woman</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">walks to me from a tree</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">right the trees died space all around</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">something like that it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">you&#39;re rehearsing a dream</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">and then for hillman what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">would move through the different</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">components of the image</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">to try to clarify the archetypal nature</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">of the image</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">we&#39;ll return to that but you can see</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">what i&#39;m getting at is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">these are paintings and screenshots from</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">uh but you could put your dream from</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">last night</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">right there i can that&#39;s the insight</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">is that the image is the like</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s what we traffic in when we traffic</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">insolent or personality</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">so you could also put the spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">constructions</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">of your imagination during the last time</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">you cried lost your temper or could not</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">so dream is the classic</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">kind of place where we go to look for</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">the images that are emerging from</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">us but so our domains</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">uh any domain that lends itself to quote</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">unquote constructive imagination</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">so this can take place in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">practice through</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:15.120" style="s2">uh intentional exercise</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">but the psyche generates image like i</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">said it traffics an image at least a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">third of its activity</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">maybe more is image</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">metabolization uh and production</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">so a lot of what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">kind of like psychotherapy quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">and other practices which are insolent</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">oriented is finding ways to</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">catch the image all right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">work with it and so that&#39;s why when i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">spoken about like</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">crying as a practice of insult</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re actually trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like a practice of constructive</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">in many ways you&#39;re trying to see what</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">what is the unbearable image</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s actually haunting you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">subconsciously and eating up all of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">energy to keep out of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">right and identifying that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">seeing what it actually is working with</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">unicity of the image because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">something to do with your uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">in relationship to others in the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">working through the unicity of the image</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">then can actually free</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">that energy um and so then you go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">now you&#39;ve gone deeper</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">because you&#39;ve just confronted something</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">you&#39;re actually terrified of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone deeper into the unique story</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">with the installment</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">so a couple things here because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">talking about images so you&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">sense of what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">image and the kind of work that we do at</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">the psychological level with</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">image right you could argue that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">people who are more deeply and sold</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">let&#39;s put it that way who&#39;ve moved</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">through more stations</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">right and i&#39;m about to speak about</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">stations the stations have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">those kinds of transformations and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">resolutions</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">within the arctic imagery of self</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">and so eventually that becomes conscious</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">as i&#39;ve been describing could become a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">practice you become aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">products of your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">and aware of the metabolism you have of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">images with</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">the world which include memory</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">moments captured in life that stick</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">right also the works of fiction and your</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">dreams that becomes aware of itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">and so deeply mature kind of been sold</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">people typically have rich storehouses</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">of imagery and often end up speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">uh richly imagistic metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:54.799" style="s2">language um so there&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">that but when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.799" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">images in particular you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">archetypal images um there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">things we we don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">kind of uh stuck on so the whole like</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">water archetypes discussion is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">interesting discussion</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">but we&#39;re talking about arc typical</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">images as opposed to talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">archetypes we don&#39;t need to essentialize</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">the archetype as often happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">practice of removing the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">from the image so when you say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">in images archetypal it&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">saying that there are archetypes in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">or that there are archetypes up in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">platonic realm which like manifest</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">in this image you don&#39;t have to say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">to say that the images are typical to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">say the image is arctiple is basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">to say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:47.360" style="s2">very richly textured with certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">potentially universal connotations</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.360" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">and so like in the demeter one right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">there was a mother archetype</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">there was a daughter archetype right</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">there was a light darkness heaven hell</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">archetype right there was also like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">hermet</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">healing and kind of between world</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">right all those are typical dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">of the image which one&#39;s primary i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">know depends who had the dream</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">uh so i&#39;d like to speak about archetype</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">archetypal imagery without getting into</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.279" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">metaphysical debates about archetype um</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">although those are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">this is not the lecture for them and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">taking more hillman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">perspective here which is to skew that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">metaphysical conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">and actually focus on our typical</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">imagery</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">which means that even if</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">the archetypal image you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">isn&#39;t technically connected to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">any of the pantheons of archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">right uh you can still have archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:50.919" style="s2">imagery</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">in everyday life which is seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.919" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">non-divine</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">or transcendent um and then so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">there is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">again as i mentioned the station&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">a pre-tragic tragic</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">post-tragic um is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">uh well it&#39;s it&#39;s almost perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">represented in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">myth of persephone right pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">persephone picking flowers</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">right kidnapped into the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">stuck completely in tragedy but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:24.000" style="s2">comes back from the underworld but has</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">to go back there every once in a while</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.000" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">right is in a post-tragic situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">tragic post-tragic uh and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">of the basic imagery of the myth and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">could grab</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">images from each of those stations</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">right and so when you&#39;re looking at your</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">insolent process that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">not am i becoming more developed and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">complex as a thinker</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">and not am i deepening awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">symbol</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">control of attention phase change like</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">meditation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:31:01.360" style="s2">that kind of stuff uh work stasis and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">uh you know altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.360" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:09.799" style="s2">it&#39;s about that is the basic root</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">metaphor or typical image of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.799" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">self-changing</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">in the way that they change in mythic</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">for example so that&#39;s the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">station</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">uh where in development what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">moved between</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">stages if you will is cognition language</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">and capacity</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">in insolent what goes through this the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">movement of stations right is image and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">like and when you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">imagination not just that something</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">happens with your eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">but again a third of the entirety of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">experience right now is the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">which is technically true like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">i can&#39;t see the room behind me well i</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">can in the video but usually one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">see the room behind me i can&#39;t see my</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">kitchen but it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">right much of the world picture that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">holding now is actually projected</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">by the psyche as imagination</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">so again each of these could be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">lecture in itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">and the history of the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">notion of imagination from the medievals</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">through kant and then to people like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">jung</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">and hillman it&#39;s a rich conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">it&#39;s important to get that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">when the root archetype in the image of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">self changes my imagination itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s what it&#39;s like to feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">different in the world because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">projecting a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">imaginal field onto the world holding a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">different image of self in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">so it&#39;s a deep change when you go from</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">pretty tragic to tragic</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">right a lot of people are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">happening to a lot that&#39;s happening like</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">most of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">western world right now even though</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:49.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen tragedy before</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s been long enough that we forgot and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.039" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">socialization contexts</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">uh so to move into the tragic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole shift in underlying</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">archetypal structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">and then a change of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">what of itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">but moving on to post-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.840" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">so uh so basically the way this cash is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:18.960" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">in personality uh is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.960" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">as i was describing this this</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">transformation of these imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">schemas</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">of interpersonal interaction so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">literally the image</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">of the self in relationship and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">relationships to other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">and to the to the to the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">who am i what am i the way you answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">that&#39;s not with</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">language and cognition the way you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">answer that&#39;s with something like an</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">of the self it&#39;s pretty rude and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">uh so there&#39;s a lot more to say there</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">but i&#39;m gonna move on to development</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">so installment moves through stations</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">and as i said</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">certain stations can&#39;t even be moved</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">through until there&#39;s requisite levels</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">of development</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">you may recall certain stage</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">acquisitions open</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">doors to stations and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">and then all of that trapped into what</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">you can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">with your awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to speak to development</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">here uh in some detail</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">so there&#39;s piaget&#39;s bald head i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">know if you can see it but this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">psja&#39;s office</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">um and the reason i use this picture is</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">development is messy the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">uh stereotypical picture you get of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">um uh from piaget and textbooks</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">um through like kohlberg</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">uh straw man keegan um</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">other folks it&#39;s just that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">ladder right that there&#39;s just these</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">stages there&#39;s like seven stages and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">give them colors</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">and we fetishize the stages and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">more about the stages</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">than about let&#39;s say how you move</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.280" style="s2">which is weird because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.280" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">and we use the stages more like</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">stereotypes to categorize</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">cultural groups or diagnostics to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">denigrate individuals and we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">about what does development actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">and when you actually look at the domain</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">of development</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">and i&#39;m not even talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">installment i&#39;m not talking about any</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">personality emotional dynamics at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about skill</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">acquisition language development</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">capacity development across various</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">it is massively complex it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">dynamical system which psja knew</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.640" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">most of psja was not translated in</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">english and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">in the 80s it was very popular to build</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">your career on basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:54.599" style="s2">burning uh piaget effigy um</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">in fact he was one of the most profound</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.599" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">epistemologists of his generation maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">any generation</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">and he was a complex dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">thinker</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:03.940" style="s2">and so the view i&#39;m going to show you of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">development here</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.940" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">is different from what you&#39;ll get in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">lot of models</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s the only one that i think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">can actually fit with this broader</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">picture because as you saw in solomon</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">was about</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">unicity right and solomon was actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">about not trying to find this universal</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">thing in the image but actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:27.359" style="s2">to linger in the complexity and unicity</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">of the image</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">and similarly development is actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">not about</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:34.720" style="s2">trying to put yourself at some abstract</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">universal level</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.720" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s about understanding the unicity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">your own developmental</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">patterns and trajectories and skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">and things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">so another deeper metaphysical dimension</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">behind all three is uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">so language cognition capacity these in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">a sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">are deceptively</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">uh the image imagination personality was</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">like they were already ambiguous so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:07.839" style="s2">were kind of like on alert</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">that you need to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.839" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">definitions these ones we think we know</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">language cognition and capacity are</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually quite complicated</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">terms again</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">this could be a lecture on itself just</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">about development</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">stages again deceptively simple term</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">um stages levels</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">tiers uh orders there&#39;s a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">the developmental kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">thresholds are described in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">literature i&#39;m going to use stages and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">levels mostly interchangeably here</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">um but here&#39;s the actual place to start</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">so this is baldwin from psychological</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">review in 1904</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a essay called the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">progression of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">psychic objects uh and so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.960" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">if you guys know integral psychology but</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">in the back of integral psychology</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">set of tables where ken wilber lays out</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">like dozens of different models across</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">a common developmental space he calls</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">altitude</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">so this is baldwin doing that in 1904</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">where he basically says listen okay we</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">know development&#39;s universal across</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">all psychological functions so i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">to spec out</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">along a common developmental kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">axis</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">what the different genetic progressions</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">through the different areas of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">the the mind so he looks at the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">logic progresses moving from the second</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">from the left pre-logical quasiological</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">logical extraological hyperlogical that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">sounds pretty dope what the hell does</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">that mean right</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">but this looks a lot like what</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">developmental theorists do</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">uh today and then it goes all the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">through modes of individuation</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">reality attention modes of control</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole thing here baldwin&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">amazing theorist the idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">that he had here was that okay when the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">mind develops</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">piaget would say the same thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">a few decades later</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:12.839" style="s2">when the mind develops it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">actually go through stages all of one</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.839" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">whole all right so this is that simple</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">ladder view</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">that you begin your whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">let&#39;s say everything&#39;s defined by being</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">pre-logical</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">and then everything all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">moves up across all this defined by</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">being quasi-logical</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">uh that&#39;s not the case not what baldwin</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">said then uh never really what psja</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">said um but it is what you hear from</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">some developmentalists now</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">uh the actual idea is that you could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">farther along on some of these lines</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">than others</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a non-synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">right which is to say not all</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">synchronically moving up at the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">time across temporally</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">there&#39;s developmental differences so</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at a kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">distributed set of skills</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">that develop asynchronously into this</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">kind of like dynamic developmental</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">profile</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">of skills so this is baldwin&#39;s view it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">very important</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">so and it ended up that the research</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">ended up kind of playing out that way</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">that these different domains of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">development emerged</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">so the cognitive and the moral that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between building</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">in operating with the world like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">physical objects and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">causal systems and there&#39;s a and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">and then building</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">skill and language and operating</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">in the social domain that those are</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">distinct</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">and that they develop asynchronously but</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">in relation</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:53.440" style="s2">that was early insight so this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">baldwin and piaget</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.440" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">both making that split and i&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:59.760" style="s2">like summarized some models across a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.760" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">but this is kind of what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll make these slides available on my</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">once the all the lectures are are given</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.599" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">so a nom all the way on the right a nami</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">heteronomy socionami</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">autonomy these is the way i characterize</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">the piagetian moral stages</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:24.440" style="s2">autonomy being what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">post-conventional</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.440" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">socio-nami being basically what we would</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">call conventional</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">and uh well no those middle to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">heteronomy and sociometry being</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">conventional anomaly being</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">pre-conventional so and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">there&#39;s more work done kolberg focused</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">on the moral line</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:47.839" style="s2">in depth armin focused on a line</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">adjacent to the moral line which is this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.839" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">line of reasoning about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.359" style="s2">the good</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">as opposed to the just fowler with faith</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.359" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">reasoning his models become</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">quite famous keegan with self uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">so similar idea that what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">a whole bunch of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">slicing this developmental pie</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">because you actually have a massively</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">distributed set of differentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">developing skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">so like almost anything you can speak to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">or operate on</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">can become an independent developing</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">this is from fisher&#39;s skill theory and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">then skills weave together into skill</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">where there are prerequisites that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">certain skills need and you use old</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">skills to build new</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">skills and things of that nature</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">and commons&#39;s model of hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">complexity and so the model of</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">hierarchical complexity it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">bit difficult to say is uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">you know featured pretty prominently in</p>

<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">so that that&#39;s like when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">like the peak of like the science of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">study of developmental stages it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">and so it tells you very little it tells</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">you how</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">much abstraction and complexity is</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">uh but it doesn&#39;t tell you if the task</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">has been accomplished well or not</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t tell you if the person</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:58.079" style="s2">is moral or anything of that nature but</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">the distillation of the model of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">hierarchical complexity basically marks</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">the kind of like</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">i think comparable to hillman&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.480" style="s2">so and the model of power cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">complexity can be interestedly</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.480" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">represented like this this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">something that kurt fisher probably drew</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">on the back of a napkin in 1980</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">and it was one of his kind of most</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">famous papers kurt was my advisor</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">recently passed away and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:40.319" style="s2">but this is an interesting distillation</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">and this is again</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">similar to stations and similar to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:49.920" style="s2">phases but different that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">change like a change of state like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.920" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">qualitative jump</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">where the output of that lower level</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">system the cube</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">the cube becomes the basic element of a</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:02.839" style="s2">system which produces an even much</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">um and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.400" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">this is like a model and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">simplification</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">of the underlying structural properties</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.040" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">cognitive development in a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:19.280" style="s2">of domains</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m staying extremely abstract uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.280" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">but you can find this discussed about in</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">more depth</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">uh on the lactica website there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">bunch of learnings</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:28.960" style="s2">um specifically about how to speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">through this</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">in specific domains i&#39;m not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">that i&#39;m staying at a very high level</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">and then as i described it you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the way the thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">moves it moves through that deepening of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">abstraction and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">but it also doesn&#39;t move up a ladder of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:48.800" style="s2">that it moves out across a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">developmental web</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.800" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">right where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">skill development is very domain</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">specific and very context</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">specific so</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">you can develop social skills quote</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">unquote in the context of online video</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.920" end="00:46:07.119" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">right but that&#39;s a very specific skill</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.119" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">stack like a very narrow area of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">web</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">in the broader social skills domain</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">is text intermediated</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">like competitive game skill building</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">with males or something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">so like and then the idea that okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">those skills now transfer to the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">your social skills is complete nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">unless you&#39;ve found a way to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">get them to do explicitly thematized</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">transfer across domain</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:38.160" style="s2">right otherwise they&#39;re just different</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">similarly in school if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">teach about critical thinking let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">in sociology class</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s very easy for kids to leave</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">and they build them thinking about oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">social issues are amenable to critical</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">and they apply critical thinking skills</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">uh and they built a skill set of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">doing that bring them to science class</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">and they may or may not apply that skill</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">set to</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">critically thinking about the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">right so you can get people who do</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">social critique all day</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">who&#39;ll just believe medicine</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">there&#39;s like i totally buy medicine like</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">give me a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">proven by science to work</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">then they&#39;re like boo and they social</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">justice capitalism and they critique the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">hell out of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.280" style="s2">because they&#39;re good at criticism</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">systems but they&#39;re not deepening the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.280" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">critique into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">into all realms where they could apply</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">their critical factors right</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">so that notion of like domain specific</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">skill acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">and skill development up the model of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">and then moving out across webs and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">the more attention you give to certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">elements of the web the more that part</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">of the web grows and</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">bless this part of the web gross right</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">evolutionary competitive tension between</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">skills within your own development</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">right and this is a big tension that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:05.839" style="s2">emerges especially</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">depending on the image of yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.839" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">the domain of installment</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">when you move into development start</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">thinking about what do i want to develop</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">you realize that skills compete skills</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">compete for time and attention</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">and your analytical faculties and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">critical faculties as i described it</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">are not easily generalizable if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">taught to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">just focus them on some things so</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">similarly your ability to exercise those</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">critical thinking skills that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">learned in</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">sociology class uh is going to fluctuate</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">functional optimal level</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">when you&#39;re in class and your teacher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">there and the book&#39;s on the desk and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">your supportive</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">classmates are also engaging in critique</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">you could operate at sometimes two</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">levels of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">beyond where you normally perform now</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">you go home and you&#39;re sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">the dinner</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">table and you&#39;re with your parents and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">maybe a friend</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to rehearse basically</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:10.319" style="s2">those same points you just rehearsed in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">class like</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">four hours ago or something uh and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">try to do that then</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">and you get some disagreement and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">you you can degrade you can drop down to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">sometimes just</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">uh and operate two complexity levels</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">below where you&#39;re operating in class</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">all right and you may not or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">aware depending upon your transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">ability and the emotional state you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.040" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">and the intensity of the charge of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">image of self of being the person who</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">talks uh critically or whatever uh so</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">this is another important point</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">right it&#39;s not a ladder it&#39;s a web</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:51.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s not you&#39;re at a level it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.040" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">a range which fluctuates a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">depending on context and where you are</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">in the web</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:05.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s all dynamical and this is some</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">of the most innovative word</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.040" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">work that kurt fisher ever did where he</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">took mathematical models that he</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">actually did what the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">dynamical systems scientists did</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">at the kind of stanford institute for</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">the advanced</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">study of behavior or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">him and robbie case</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">and paul van giert</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">and so they put in the parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">theoretical models into dynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">dynamic systems modeling uh software</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">and they started to show that okay if</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">you do think of skills in this way in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">terms of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">self-regulation and differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">growers which is different skills</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">competing for time and attention</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:53.119" style="s2">you can actually make a system that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">moves through a series of wave-like</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.119" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">stages</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">so this was like a something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">theoretical experimental</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">psychology where the math itself shows</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">you the coherence of the basic</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">underlying theoretical frame it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">conversation but these are the two most</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">interesting models that kurt</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">produced one just basically shows that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">on the left you do get these wave-like</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">stages of growth over time even when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">have competing</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">systems that they can cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">the one on the right this is called the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">psja effect if you take one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">growers</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">right one of the skill sets and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">kind of focus on that one to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">detriments of others</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">early so this would be like taking the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">math one out and just drilling the kid</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">on math</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">or like tiger woods you take the golf</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">one out and you just drill on golf</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">right you end up disregulating the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:52.960" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">system and then the final output is</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">a spread much more differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">developmental profile</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">which means you&#39;re like all spread out</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">different levels different skills are at</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">different levels which is hard for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">self system</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">to hold together and so this is like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">part of what you get when you start</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">thinking about one dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">man and the distortions of personality</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">in modern educational systems it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">kind of dysregulation of coherence skill</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">integration and development through kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">of like abnormally</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">trying to boost certain skill domains on</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:37.520" style="s2">timelines so so that&#39;s interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">you start thinking dynamical system wise</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">and you start thinking about multiple</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">growers</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">then start thinking about oh wow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.520" end="00:52:50.720" style="s2">interventions and cognitive dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">of growth</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">have ramifications throughout the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">cognitivism</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">and the notion of like uh what</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">the power of integrative uh curricula in</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:04.400" style="s2">particular become</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">extremely noted uh again there&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;m moving so fast there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">like so much more to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">so i think this is the last one no</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">there&#39;s one more uh so now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">get micro development</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">so this is again you&#39;re drinking from</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:16.960" style="s2">the fire hose here and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">resources on this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">uh so we just saw that like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">dynamic patterns of growth</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s interrelation between</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">growers uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">and now we&#39;re seeing that if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">this so this is an exchange</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">of two people they&#39;re speaking uh about</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.760" style="s2">a little robotic toy that they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">to fix</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.760" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">that&#39;s on the table in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">this is an experimental situation that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:41.920" style="s2">uh kurt and his colleagues set up</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:43.599" style="s2">actually known as nina grinneau who&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.920" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">the sub</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.599" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">and basically over a matter of like an</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">their conversations move at least three</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">different levels</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">of development within that hour so</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:56.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a common misconception like okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">post conventional you&#39;re like quote</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">unquote second tier or you&#39;re yellow or</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">whatever right that means that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">always yellow</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">in all contexts always operating at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">certain very high level of development</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s just completely incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">uh development and what&#39;s required of</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">you is</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">context specific and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">overwhelming evidence as this simple</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">experiment shows that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking with someone else</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">about an actual problem in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">you&#39;re forced to move up and down the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">developmental register like they had to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">the ones down in the one that&#39;s actions</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s literally picking it up and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">looking at it and saying something</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">concrete about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">and then they start to extract up out</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">into representations and abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">about the object</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">so when you look at micro development</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">you&#39;re actually seeing these patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">moving up and down the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">register</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">very consistently and it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">pathology in this case</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">to only speak about this thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">abstract because you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">and name things and use indexical</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">pointing procedures</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">in the actions and representations</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">levels to even understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">what it is so yeah again lots of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">misconceptions about what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">at certain stages</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">here&#39;s another micro developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">this is a therapeutic dyad so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">therapist and a patient</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">speaking over 118</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">exchanges within a single therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">session and this is tracking both</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">of what&#39;s discussed the number of themes</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">discussed and the emotional salience</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">and what you&#39;re seeing is that in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">psychotherapy therapeutic diet</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">there&#39;s tremendous variability in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">abstraction and complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">language used and the emotional dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.640" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">so the idea that like oh okay if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">a coach or a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re getting self-authored people</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">who took a keegan test and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">determined that they were self-authored</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">and therefore you&#39;re going to treat them</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">in therapy like self-authored people</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">right maybe maybe not depending how</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">emotionally triggered they are what</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about and what the dream</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">was last night</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">you could end up being way down and</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">speaking with them at representational</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">levels getting rich descriptions of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">their parents house</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">or dinner table right so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">think in a very complex way when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">thinking developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:15.440" style="s2">very differently actually than than most</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">of the standard kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.440" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">here&#39;s a ladder of development uh and</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2">your whole person moves through</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">stages which can be given labels like</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">colors and things</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s development is done</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">how&#39;s the time do we know what time it</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re two coming up on the hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">i have uh 32 minutes left 13 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">all right i think i&#39;m actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">hold this one and do it at the next</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">one and take questions on what i just</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">spoke to because i think if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:53.200" style="s2">and this can like be certain basic</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">confusions with what was previously</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.200" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">spoken</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">then that i don&#39;t want to do that so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">going to hold this this one will only</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:03.280" style="s2">take about</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">maybe 15 minutes or something at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">beginning of the next one and then we</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:06.960" style="s2">can move into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:08.319" style="s2">practicum it will also give me an</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.960" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">opportunity to put a couple slides</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">together about</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">what i want to do in the practicum that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">i can show you right before we</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">begin it uh which will be useful um</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:19.839" style="s2">cool so let&#39;s switch out of this and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.839" end="00:57:26.799" style="s2">kind of questions and exchange</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:28.319" style="s2">fantastic so scott had a question</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.799" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">scott would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.319" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">oh i can&#39;t hear you scott</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">still nothing maybe write it into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">chat box scott</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">well i can ask i can ask god&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:05.839" style="s2">for him</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">okay so his first question</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.839" end="00:58:09.280" style="s2">pierced his categories are connected to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">stages or phases</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.280" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">firstness is exemplified by icons</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">secondness by indices or contrast</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">thirdness is symbol bodies of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">libraries</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">how are these related to your categories</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">yeah i know the well there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">there one is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the persian triple being related</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">stations and stages and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">persian triple red as a semiotic</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:41.760" style="s2">and how that relates to the three or to</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:45.280" style="s2">psychology in general</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.760" end="00:58:46.799" style="s2">and so it&#39;s true that you can lay out</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.280" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">one two three horizontally</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">as i did transcendence and soma</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">development but if you look within let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">say development</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">and that figure that i showed you that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">kurt made with the dot</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">and then the line the barbell and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:01.920" style="s2">the square</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">and then the cube you can interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.920" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">also along</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">the triple right firstness literally the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">one dot</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">secondness the two dots thirdness</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:17.680" style="s2">being the system and then the new</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">firstness is also the next role</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.680" end="00:59:22.000" style="s2">of the third right so then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">actually a saying from</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">alchemy uh first followed by the second</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">which is followed by the third which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">about followed by the fourth which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:30.799" style="s2">another one</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a weird mystical saying but</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">the idea being that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">the triple rolls over and it come</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">becomes the new firstness</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.680" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">um so you can see the person in</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">categories development</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">moving that way and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">the kind of like persian</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">symbol index icon</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">with these three i&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">worth trying to think about</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:58.799" style="s2">doing it right now i mean he had a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">different terminology right so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.799" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">symbol for him would be with</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">language i think the icon</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">might be image and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">index might be uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">what we&#39;re calling a symbol in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">language so i&#39;d have to work that out</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">this probably isn&#39;t the place to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">but i think that what i just did might</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">be correct</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">but now i can&#39;t remember yeah we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">hear you scott</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">i have a feeling you&#39;re asking very</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">difficult questions so i feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">probably good</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">for me that your pointed criticism can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">come through</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">all right sorry about that scott so</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll move on to another question</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">uh sam c you had a question me on you</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">hi zach hey man</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:55.920" style="s2">i wanted to ask you about the role of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">emotions in your framework</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.920" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">you talked last time about emotion</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">regulation</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">in transcendence to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:08.319" style="s2">you know like descent this this</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">identified yourself and put your</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">into what you got to do i understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">but i see also emotions</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">as as a guide for motivation</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:27.520" style="s2">in deliberate practices in</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">in the developmental realm</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.520" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">and also as a guide for the intuition</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">that guides you into the installment</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.599" end="01:01:41.760" style="s2">process so how</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">how do you see emotions moving into your</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.760" end="01:01:45.680" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">how do you work with them and how do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.680" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">alchemically purify them so they are the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">guide</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">and you just don&#39;t this disidentify with</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:02:01.680" style="s2">totally yeah very very good question</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:03.599" style="s2">and you&#39;re right to see a motion uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.680" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">kind of touching on all three which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.599" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">to say when you view emotion from</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">development where you could view emotion</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">from installment or you could view</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">emotion from</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">transcendent if you want to kind of hold</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">them as frames</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">and so yeah in the in the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at phase</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:21.280" style="s2">shifts in emotion that have to do with</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">the exercise of</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.280" end="01:02:25.520" style="s2">will in the control of emotion now</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the most one of the most basic</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">elements</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:29.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s aided through symbol and as i</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">said the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.640" end="01:02:33.520" style="s2">depersonalization trans personalization</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.520" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">and so that&#39;s kind of like kind of get</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:38.079" style="s2">that insolence actually much more</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2">complicated because in solomon you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.079" end="01:02:41.359" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to actually kind of let go</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">of the will</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.359" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">to go down and into emotion uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">and so like as i was saying when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">crying and your imagination is</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">spontaneously producing</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">images of the thing that you&#39;re crying</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">that&#39;s tremendously informative</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:01.359" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.319" style="s2">just as a dream is but a dream is also</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.359" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">not willed</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.319" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">you&#39;re not willing the dream and dreams</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">can be tremendously emotional</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:10.720" style="s2">so the notion of insolent is actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">like to find a way to kind of quote</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.720" end="01:03:14.000" style="s2">unquote explore</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">emotions to go into the underworld of</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.000" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">um which is easier to do if you have</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">strong transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">practice right so and so those kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">interanimate but the more i can explore</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">emotion through insolent the more</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">i can learn to work with emotion in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">domain of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">transcendent so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">notions of tantra</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">basically right that actually you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">want to stop</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:41.520" style="s2">anger from arising you actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">sometimes want to make anger arise</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">precisely so they</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">have the opportunity to work with it</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">uh and so that&#39;s that dynamic and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">in development</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:56.559" style="s2">that&#39;s where you get a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">kind of cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.559" end="01:03:59.680" style="s2">script rewriting there&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:03.119" style="s2">of things you can do</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.680" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">that actually turn emotion and reveal</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.119" end="01:04:06.880" style="s2">its linguistic and cognitive dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:08.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.880" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">and so that&#39;s like one branch of it and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.480" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">the other branch is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">you actually need cognition and often a</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:19.520" style="s2">kind of reflective and cultural kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:21.520" style="s2">assets</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.520" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">to understand the image and the emotion</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">that comes with image</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">so like the craziest things that happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">is when people have dreams</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">and the dreams like and of course this</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.400" style="s2">is classic jung</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">the dream&#39;s just it&#39;s a myth</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">like it&#39;s literally a myth from some</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">ancient culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">and they have never heard this never</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">read it or anything like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">and they go to a psychologist or a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">friend or whatever or they even google</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">the image that came to them</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">and they get this whole thing and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">they start in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:51.119" style="s2">they went from okay you spontaneously</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">given an image</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.119" end="01:04:55.599" style="s2">in the process of installment and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">forces you in the domain of development</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.599" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">to build a whole bunch of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">about the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">and a whole bunch of like reframing of</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">like history</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">and causality like how did you even have</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:08.880" style="s2">that dream and like a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:10.400" style="s2">other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.880" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">so that that&#39;s the kind of place where</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.400" end="01:05:12.640" style="s2">in the domain of development sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">you need</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.640" end="01:05:16.079" style="s2">to be equipped there to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.079" end="01:05:22.960" style="s2">work with image and</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">like i said one of the basic processes</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.960" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">of extracting the symbol from the image</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.640" style="s2">to go transcendent and change phase of</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:36.640" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.640" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.640" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">you can&#39;t identify the symbol in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">dream unless you&#39;re a jungian</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.920" end="01:05:45.200" style="s2">psychologist and you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">30 books on like you know mythic</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">archetypes um so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.280" end="01:05:51.359" style="s2">dimensionality where cognition</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">aids in transcendence as well by being</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.359" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">able to identify universal</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">uh pattern so</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">so yeah awesome question thank you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">can you hear me now yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">all right yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:15.119" style="s2">i i just i guess i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">a bunch of beeps and stuff so um but</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.119" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">what i was going to say is that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:22.559" style="s2">symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">was was for purse thirdness</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.559" end="01:06:25.599" style="s2">and and to him it signified something</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:32.400" style="s2">libraries like accumulated knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">and understanding um and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.400" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">secondness was indices um</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">which would be contrast it would be uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">how do you come up with a measurement</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:43.839" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">to decide what you&#39;re going to theorize</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.839" end="01:06:48.559" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:50.480" style="s2">and so forth firstness would be sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.559" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">what you want to get back to which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.480" end="01:06:54.240" style="s2">everything is coal and</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">and you know there are no there are no</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.240" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">particular problems and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">being and maybe you&#39;re being in ecstasy</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">or something like that and it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">in the contrast just suddenly the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">ecstasy stops and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:09.280" style="s2">and you want to do something about that</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:11.680" style="s2">you want to get back to the ecstasy or</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.280" end="01:07:11.680" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">and uh the second the second question i</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:20.160" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">um had to do with uh how does</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.160" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">um how does mcluhan&#39;s tetrad</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">uh fit into this the the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">enhancement i&#39;m sure figures into it in</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:35.839" style="s2">terms of development</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">uh a technological enhancement that</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.839" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">in turn changes the mentality</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">uh acts on the brain rewires the brain</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">it obsolesces something that had gone</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">before so</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">a bunch of behaviors and habits that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">have become used to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:54.079" style="s2">are no longer relevant and they go into</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:07:59.680" style="s2">we retrieve something from the past uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:01.760" style="s2">we retrieve a bunch of habits and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:03.280" style="s2">like that because of the new technology</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.760" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">but it relates to something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.280" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">experienced before</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">have forgotten and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">finally the notion of reversal which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">the way i see it is when something is</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:18.400" style="s2">pushed past its limit</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">when you haven&#39;t defined limits for it</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.400" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">like let&#39;s say you haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">defined limits for anti-racism</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">when you&#39;ve achieved it so at a certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">you push it past its limit and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">anti-racism becomes racism</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:38.239" style="s2">so it does the opposite of what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">originally intended for it to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.239" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">fascinating yeah i hadn&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:43.359" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.359" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2">characterization of purses triple</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">uh and you could see just from listening</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.520" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">to that how it might slot in to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">three that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">speaking to mcloone&#39;s is is deeper and a</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">little bit more interesting because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:58.640" style="s2">how does that phenomenon affect the</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">which is to say how is insolent</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">different now in the digital</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:05.600" style="s2">as opposed to the electric as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.600" end="01:09:08.799" style="s2">uh gutenberg galaxy as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">oral right</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.799" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s fascinating if the three have</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">always existed</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">as the basic dimensions of psyche how</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:19.359" style="s2">have we been reconfigured</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:20.239" style="s2">in our cyclical unfolding in these</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.359" end="01:09:22.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.239" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">kind of environments of technology and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.960" end="01:09:28.000" style="s2">media so that&#39;s like a whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:30.560" style="s2">huge door to open and think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.000" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">and then his more detailed work on</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.560" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">enhancement retrieval</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:37.600" style="s2">and what was the other one enhancement</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.000" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">retrieval</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.600" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">uh enhancement um</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:45.520" style="s2">obsolescence retrieval and reversal</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">reversal you&#39;re in return yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.520" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">really interesting i have to think more</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:50.000" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">that would allow us to answer a little</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.000" end="01:09:53.520" style="s2">bit about</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">that prior question about what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.520" end="01:09:59.199" style="s2">different now</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:10:01.440" style="s2">during the digital and</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.199" end="01:10:03.040" style="s2">both across development and solomon and</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.440" end="01:10:05.760" style="s2">transcendence so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.040" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">pretty heavy cool thank you scott i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.760" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">put it on my docket</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">to interanimate with mcluhan a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">bit more</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">and john you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.239" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">hey zach hey</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:24.560" style="s2">um my dad&#39;s a psychiatrist and so this</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">feels like a very important moment for</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.560" end="01:10:28.880" style="s2">me to have so many of these</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">things that i learned at the dinner</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.880" end="01:10:33.199" style="s2">table come to me at such a</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">such a level of principle and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.199" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.480" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">understanding so thank you um</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:45.360" style="s2">my question is i&#39;ve been similarly</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">stunned by greg henrique&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.360" end="01:10:48.880" style="s2">that i&#39;ve come across this year and</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.040" end="01:10:51.120" style="s2">trying to figure out how to mesh that</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:54.480" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying um i&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.120" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">curious to hear you talk about that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.480" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">i was just speaking to greg hendricks</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:11:02.080" style="s2">about that question uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">on monday or friday i can&#39;t remember uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.080" end="01:11:06.159" style="s2">i mean basically they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">they&#39;re both uh metapsychologists</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.159" end="01:11:11.679" style="s2">so like um they&#39;re both operating in</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:13.360" style="s2">that domain between the special sciences</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.679" end="01:11:15.600" style="s2">and fields of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.360" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">and what&#39;s often called metaphysics or</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.600" end="01:11:19.600" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:21.360" style="s2">so in that sense they&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.600" end="01:11:25.760" style="s2">family of</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.360" end="01:11:29.280" style="s2">work and i see them</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.760" end="01:11:29.280" style="s2">more or less as complement</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.960" end="01:11:34.320" style="s2">detailed work to do where i could take</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.320" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">henrik&#39;s model and show how my triple</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:41.679" style="s2">arises within the architecture of his</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:43.600" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.679" end="01:11:45.360" style="s2">um so i think that&#39;s work that could be</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:47.040" style="s2">done which i&#39;m not going to do here</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.360" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">so far i haven&#39;t seen any places where</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.040" end="01:11:51.360" style="s2">like my model suggests that</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">there&#39;s inadequacies or absences i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.360" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">it actually might be the reverse</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:55.760" style="s2">um i think the main difference is</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:58.000" style="s2">probably aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.760" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">which is to say i think greg is much</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.000" end="01:12:04.000" style="s2">more attempting to address</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:06.800" style="s2">scientists in the fields of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.000" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">to get them to attempt to basically</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:10.960" style="s2">change the way they understand their own</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:13.440" style="s2">scientific practice</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:15.360" style="s2">whereas i&#39;m not attempting to do that</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.440" end="01:12:17.120" style="s2">basically at all</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.360" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">i&#39;m attempting to speak to people like</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.120" end="01:12:19.920" style="s2">you all</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">who are interested in the field of</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.920" end="01:12:22.880" style="s2">psychology especially to try to help</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">themselves and others</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.880" end="01:12:26.000" style="s2">navigate an increasingly crisis-ridden</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.280" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.000" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">kind of frightening and uh fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:33.199" style="s2">um so i&#39;m much more in that dimension</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:35.760" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.199" end="01:12:37.679" style="s2">kind of like go and end around from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.760" end="01:12:39.120" style="s2">academy and go directly kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.679" end="01:12:41.440" style="s2">to the people so in that sense maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.120" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit more wilburian that</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.440" end="01:12:45.360" style="s2">i&#39;m just trying to say okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:47.120" style="s2">psychology like and so greg has his work</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.360" end="01:12:48.480" style="s2">cut out for him i think because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.120" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">very difficult to move</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.480" end="01:12:53.120" style="s2">in the established fields of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.960" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">and to try to get them to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.120" end="01:12:57.360" style="s2">change their practices which many of</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">which by virtue of greg&#39;s modeling look</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.360" end="01:13:01.800" style="s2">absurd</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:02.960" style="s2">like category errors and definitional</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.800" end="01:13:06.640" style="s2">inadequacies</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.960" end="01:13:10.159" style="s2">and methodological uh like</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.640" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">fiction basically so in that respect</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.159" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">i love greg&#39;s work but i do think mine</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:16.719" style="s2">might be a little bit less</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:19.280" style="s2">ambitious in that respect and a little</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.719" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">bit more aesthetically focused</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.280" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">to be directly</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:27.440" style="s2">useful to non-specialists in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:28.880" style="s2">or something something like that</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.440" end="01:13:30.480" style="s2">but i&#39;m continuing to try to think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:32.080" style="s2">the detail work</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.480" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">and figure out how i can kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.080" end="01:13:37.040" style="s2">incorporate more of greg&#39;s modeling</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:37.760" style="s2">into the aesthetics of my kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.040" end="01:13:39.520" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.760" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">um that would probably be one way to</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.520" end="01:13:42.560" style="s2">think about it but i&#39;m very happy that</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:43.440" style="s2">yeah his is getting the attention it</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.560" end="01:13:45.199" style="s2">deserves</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.440" end="01:13:46.560" style="s2">you know wilbur&#39;s integral psychology i</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.199" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">think is another one of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.560" end="01:13:51.199" style="s2">kind of scope and there&#39;s a couple other</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:54.800" style="s2">pretty interesting ones elliot jacks is</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.199" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">um uh you know the one laid out</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.800" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">in revisioning psychology uh by james</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">hillman i thought about the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">this putting up a list of books of like</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:04.719" style="s2">comparable metapsychological projects</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:07.199" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.719" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">i didn&#39;t so so that&#39;s a little bit to</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.199" end="01:14:09.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:10.800" style="s2">my sense is that at some point maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.199" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">greg and i&#39;ll write</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.800" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">together or do a call where we both</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.480" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">speak and do some of that detailed work</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.480" end="01:14:20.239" style="s2">and then also show that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:22.320" style="s2">irrespective of how the detail work</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.239" end="01:14:25.679" style="s2">hashes out there&#39;s an alignment</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.320" end="01:14:27.920" style="s2">of focus and</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.679" end="01:14:29.600" style="s2">a lot of what we&#39;re saying is is very</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.920" end="01:14:33.600" style="s2">identical in fact</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.600" end="01:14:35.040" style="s2">so cool thank you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.600" end="01:14:38.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind me asking a quick</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.040" end="01:14:40.080" style="s2">follow-up um as a layman with both of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.000" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">these in my head</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.080" end="01:14:44.480" style="s2">do you have a helpful way of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">slotting them together like accesses or</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.480" end="01:14:49.520" style="s2">ways because i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:51.199" style="s2">i&#39;m struggling sometimes with both of</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.520" end="01:14:53.360" style="s2">the thoughts in the last two weeks</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.199" end="01:14:56.080" style="s2">coming to mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.360" end="01:14:57.120" style="s2">well the first thing i&#39;ll say is like to</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.080" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">have that struggle</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.120" end="01:15:00.880" style="s2">is an awesome struggle to have like</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the the kabbalah say something</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.880" end="01:15:03.520" style="s2">like you know difficulties in the realms</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">of delight</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.520" end="01:15:07.280" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">working at meta</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.280" end="01:15:11.360" style="s2">levels with those types of models you</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">have to understand that like the task</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.360" end="01:15:16.159" style="s2">demand of that cognitively it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:19.040" style="s2">it&#39;s huge so that you&#39;re confused makes</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.159" end="01:15:22.400" style="s2">me think you&#39;re doing a good job</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.040" end="01:15:25.520" style="s2">this is the advice i tend to</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.400" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">thank you if you figured it all out</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.520" end="01:15:29.040" style="s2">you probably didn&#39;t if you&#39;re confused</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.440" end="01:15:30.080" style="s2">it means you&#39;re actually in the learning</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.040" end="01:15:31.760" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.080" end="01:15:33.120" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s my first bit of advice</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.760" end="01:15:34.239" style="s2">which is like don&#39;t try to be really</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.120" end="01:15:36.960" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.239" end="01:15:39.920" style="s2">that these are actually really big rich</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.960" end="01:15:42.880" style="s2">models and trying to inner animate them</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.920" end="01:15:43.920" style="s2">could be complex and difficult my</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.880" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.920" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">sense would be a couple fold one is that</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.600" end="01:15:55.840" style="s2">you know you can slot a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">into greg&#39;s model there&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.840" end="01:16:01.199" style="s2">full of triples</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:02.719" style="s2">already so you could identify that</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">that&#39;s one basic move</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.719" end="01:16:08.640" style="s2">is to just take greg&#39;s model as primary</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:10.400" style="s2">and to go hunting through it for</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.640" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">transcendence and soulmate development</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.400" end="01:16:13.199" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:13.920" style="s2">use mine as a category scheme to try to</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.199" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.920" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">slightly re-categorize him so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:20.719" style="s2">way to go</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:22.480" style="s2">um you know i think you can use the work</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.719" end="01:16:24.719" style="s2">i&#39;m doing in development</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.480" end="01:16:26.800" style="s2">to actually shore up some of greg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.719" end="01:16:28.640" style="s2">models uh where he doesn&#39;t bring in</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.800" end="01:16:31.760" style="s2">piaget and other folks like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.640" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s a good actual additional kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.760" end="01:16:35.440" style="s2">of amendment or appendix to greg&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">which would be something like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.440" end="01:16:39.199" style="s2">talk i just gave on development which</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:40.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t contradict anything of what he</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.199" end="01:16:42.719" style="s2">said but actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.480" end="01:16:45.760" style="s2">unpacks a lot of how development</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.719" end="01:16:48.560" style="s2">actually formally takes place</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.760" end="01:16:49.679" style="s2">and yeah so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.560" end="01:16:50.719" style="s2">but the main thing i would say is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.679" end="01:16:52.800" style="s2">just keep</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:53.840" style="s2">reading greg&#39;s work uh unfortunately i</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.800" end="01:16:57.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t written anything</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.840" end="01:16:57.679" style="s2">as in depth uh so but i yeah i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.120" end="01:17:00.719" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.679" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">um yeah reaching you know getting greg</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.719" end="01:17:03.760" style="s2">and i together to speak i think might be</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:05.600" style="s2">a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.760" end="01:17:08.080" style="s2">although we may just confuse you more so</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.600" end="01:17:08.080" style="s2">but we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.880" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">thank you um arie had a question</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:19.520" style="s2">go ahead and ask it hey brother</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:20.080" style="s2">hey zach how you doing buddy all right</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.520" end="01:17:23.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.080" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">i you know the chapter five of your book</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">talks about this gaffney&#39;s unique self</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:29.520" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">and i think that my question is more</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.520" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">how it how that chapter and this</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.719" end="01:17:39.840" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:43.520" style="s2">relates to my own confusion as</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.840" end="01:17:46.960" style="s2">to what spiritual development looks like</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.520" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">through the buddhist thing you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.960" end="01:17:50.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:51.840" style="s2">i i felt very validated by reading that</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.400" end="01:17:54.000" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.840" end="01:17:55.760" style="s2">like the idea of dissolving into nobody</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.000" end="01:17:59.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.760" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">entice me that much for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.120" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">i was hoping you could like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:06.560" style="s2">help me kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:08.480" style="s2">understand the post-modern conception of</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.560" end="01:18:14.159" style="s2">spiritual development</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.480" end="01:18:14.159" style="s2">and what those two lenses might</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.640" end="01:18:21.440" style="s2">lend totally yeah uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.239" end="01:18:24.840" style="s2">thank you for that question um</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.440" end="01:18:27.920" style="s2">so a few things on that one is</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:31.520" style="s2">uh this aside by</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.920" end="01:18:35.199" style="s2">james hillman in the book uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.520" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2">poohair and cenex and it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.199" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:41.199" style="s2">soul and spirit</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">which is very important which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.199" end="01:18:44.320" style="s2">actually a difference that exists in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:47.040" style="s2">whole bunch of traditions</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:49.840" style="s2">but which was written out of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.040" end="01:18:49.840" style="s2">catholic church</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.600" end="01:18:57.760" style="s2">and they outlawed images as well</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.199" end="01:18:58.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s worth noting that the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.760" end="01:19:02.320" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.880" end="01:19:05.360" style="s2">life mind or spirit</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.320" end="01:19:06.159" style="s2">something like that as a kind of great</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.360" end="01:19:08.080" style="s2">chain of being</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.159" end="01:19:09.199" style="s2">if you want to go there and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:11.440" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.199" end="01:19:12.719" style="s2">insolent and transcendence being the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.440" end="01:19:14.480" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.719" end="01:19:16.159" style="s2">work at the level of soul and work at</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.480" end="01:19:18.320" style="s2">the level of spirit</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.159" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">and so in that essay by hillman which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.320" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">like beautiful i think it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:24.159" style="s2">peaks and veils or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">which is peaks and valleys</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.159" end="01:19:30.480" style="s2">in the essay by hillman he</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.080" end="01:19:32.080" style="s2">gives this excerpt from a letter from</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.480" end="01:19:34.000" style="s2">the dalai lama</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.080" end="01:19:35.360" style="s2">where the dalai lama is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.000" end="01:19:36.400" style="s2">basically explain the differences</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.360" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">between these different</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">forms of practice basically between soul</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:44.400" style="s2">which actually exists in some forms of</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">buddhism and spirit work</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.400" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">which also exists in some forms of</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:49.920" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:50.719" style="s2">and so he said like you know once there</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.920" end="01:19:52.480" style="s2">were these beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.719" end="01:19:55.280" style="s2">it tells a story an image actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.480" end="01:19:57.040" style="s2">paints an image which is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.280" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">once there were these beautiful monks</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.040" end="01:20:02.000" style="s2">and they went to this valley</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:02.880" style="s2">and they set up a monastery and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.000" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">valley was</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.880" end="01:20:06.480" style="s2">lush with greenery and there were</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:08.320" style="s2">streams going through it they had</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.480" end="01:20:10.560" style="s2">mud in it and there was light and there</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.320" end="01:20:14.000" style="s2">was dark and they chanted</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.560" end="01:20:17.040" style="s2">and it was awesome and then a few monks</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.000" end="01:20:20.080" style="s2">even more beautiful went up</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.040" end="01:20:21.440" style="s2">into the mountains out of the valley the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.080" end="01:20:24.159" style="s2">plants disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.440" end="01:20:25.360" style="s2">the glaciers were there kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.159" end="01:20:28.400" style="s2">just geometric</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.360" end="01:20:29.679" style="s2">perfection a single flower bloomed with</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.400" end="01:20:31.920" style="s2">like ornate</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.679" end="01:20:33.120" style="s2">beauty and they set up a monastery and</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.920" end="01:20:37.199" style="s2">they did no</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.120" end="01:20:39.600" style="s2">chanting right and it was even better</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.199" end="01:20:40.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s his way of like painting an</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.600" end="01:20:42.800" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.320" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">of the difference between soul and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.800" end="01:20:46.480" style="s2">spirit work</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:47.760" style="s2">right where the soul work is the work in</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.480" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2">the valley</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.760" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">with all these different shades of green</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.840" end="01:20:52.719" style="s2">and light and darkness and the muds and</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:55.120" style="s2">the valley</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.719" end="01:20:57.199" style="s2">and all of those things and spirit work</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.120" end="01:20:59.760" style="s2">is that work that takes place</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.199" end="01:21:00.800" style="s2">high up in the kind of geometric</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.760" end="01:21:03.920" style="s2">perfection</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.800" end="01:21:04.880" style="s2">of the glaciers um kind of where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.920" end="01:21:07.679" style="s2">only light</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.880" end="01:21:08.719" style="s2">uh and sounds travel very far and this</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.679" end="01:21:12.639" style="s2">single flower</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.719" end="01:21:15.360" style="s2">blooms uh and so generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.639" end="01:21:16.239" style="s2">like a practice like zen buddhism for</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.360" end="01:21:19.679" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.239" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">or vipassana meditation</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.679" end="01:21:23.360" style="s2">um or many of what wilbur would call the</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:24.880" style="s2">ascending</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">paths even certain forms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.880" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">contemplative prayer and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:31.760" style="s2">jungian symbol work that this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:34.960" style="s2">takes place up</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.760" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">on the peaks where uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.960" end="01:21:40.560" style="s2">basically uh totally</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:43.280" style="s2">amazing beautiful forms of transpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.560" end="01:21:47.159" style="s2">experience can take place</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.280" end="01:21:50.239" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the full</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.159" end="01:21:52.159" style="s2">dimensionality of psychic growth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.239" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.159" end="01:21:55.679" style="s2">and so there&#39;s the dimension of work</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:58.239" style="s2">that&#39;s in solomon based</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.679" end="01:21:59.840" style="s2">which is also trans personal work which</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.239" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">is also to say it&#39;s technically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.840" end="01:22:03.520" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:04.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s in the realm of soul and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.520" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">there&#39;s spiritual work that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.639" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">realm</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.800" end="01:22:15.199" style="s2">working normal soul is not less personal</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.840" end="01:22:19.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s just uh again</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.199" end="01:22:23.040" style="s2">not an up and out into an impersonality</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:26.320" style="s2">but a down and in into a uniqueness</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.040" end="01:22:28.320" style="s2">right and so gaffney&#39;s model originally</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.320" end="01:22:30.719" style="s2">articulated book called soul prince</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.320" end="01:22:32.239" style="s2">um is that notion that yes the</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.719" end="01:22:34.159" style="s2">transcendence huge</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.239" end="01:22:35.679" style="s2">but you don&#39;t go up to the peak and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.159" end="01:22:36.960" style="s2">stay up at the peak you go up to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.679" end="01:22:38.159" style="s2">peak and then you actually come back</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.960" end="01:22:39.440" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.159" end="01:22:41.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not mountain climbing works you</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.440" end="01:22:44.719" style="s2">can&#39;t live on the peak by definition</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.440" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">uh it&#39;s quite inhospitable uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.719" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">um but gorgeous views you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:52.880" style="s2">back in to the valley so the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:54.239" style="s2">unique self is that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.880" end="01:22:57.679" style="s2">disappear into</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.239" end="01:23:00.800" style="s2">oneness and experience the lack of</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.679" end="01:23:04.159" style="s2">cognition lack of object awareness</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.800" end="01:23:04.880" style="s2">lack of self-identity story just bodily</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.159" end="01:23:07.199" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.880" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">and consciousness as such like important</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:10.560" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:11.440" style="s2">even for emotional self-regulation and</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.560" end="01:23:14.480" style="s2">knowing what</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.440" end="01:23:18.320" style="s2">the nature of self is like</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.480" end="01:23:20.719" style="s2">but that is actually reintegrated</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.320" end="01:23:21.360" style="s2">into whatever process of installment you</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.719" end="01:23:24.639" style="s2">are at</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.360" end="01:23:27.600" style="s2">going down and into your life and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.639" end="01:23:29.360" style="s2">the risk of joining the beautiful monks</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:32.560" style="s2">up on the peaks</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.360" end="01:23:35.520" style="s2">uh is that you can get stuck</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.560" end="01:23:37.199" style="s2">up there um and so you see people with</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:39.760" style="s2">these kind of dual life</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.199" end="01:23:41.520" style="s2">kind of trajectories where the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.760" end="01:23:43.440" style="s2">having to flee the world</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.520" end="01:23:45.440" style="s2">to go live on the peak is the only way</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.440" end="01:23:48.719" style="s2">to be spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.440" end="01:23:50.880" style="s2">um uh and so that notion of bringing the</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.719" end="01:23:53.199" style="s2">soul and spirit practices</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.880" end="01:23:54.159" style="s2">together was what hillman was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.199" end="01:23:58.159" style="s2">recommend</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.159" end="01:24:00.000" style="s2">and uh so in a concrete way</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.159" end="01:24:02.159" style="s2">if you&#39;re working with your tension and</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.000" end="01:24:03.600" style="s2">your consciousness and symbol as</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.159" end="01:24:06.159" style="s2">part of your practice then you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.600" end="01:24:09.920" style="s2">spirit work transcendence which is great</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.159" end="01:24:13.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re working with image imagination</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.920" end="01:24:15.600" style="s2">personality uh and archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.280" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">imagery in particular then you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.600" end="01:24:18.320" style="s2">insolent work</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:19.840" style="s2">uh and if you&#39;re building the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.320" end="01:24:21.760" style="s2">apparatus which by the way is sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.840" end="01:24:24.080" style="s2">a lot more important</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.760" end="01:24:26.000" style="s2">given how complex the world is like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.080" end="01:24:26.560" style="s2">always like maybe read some long ass</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.000" end="01:24:29.120" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.560" end="01:24:30.480" style="s2">instead of meditating all day that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.120" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">another conversation</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.480" end="01:24:33.840" style="s2">you also need to work in that domain of</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.040" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.840" end="01:24:37.920" style="s2">or else all of that stuff as deep as</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:41.280" style="s2">your consciousness has become</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.920" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">uh you&#39;re equipped you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.280" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">to do very little because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:47.600" style="s2">the languages and the cognitive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:24:49.040" style="s2">and the fidelity with objects in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.600" end="01:24:52.239" style="s2">world and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.040" end="01:24:53.360" style="s2">so all three need to be going uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.239" end="01:24:55.360" style="s2">and so yeah if you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.360" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">language cognition capacity so just</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.360" end="01:25:01.120" style="s2">think like how much of my practices are</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">in the domain of working with my own</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.120" end="01:25:05.920" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:07.600" style="s2">to use the will to regulate my emotion</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.920" end="01:25:09.840" style="s2">and how much of my practices are in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.600" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">domain of activating</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.840" end="01:25:13.440" style="s2">constructive imagination working with</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:15.360" style="s2">images</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.440" end="01:25:16.960" style="s2">moving through stations deepening</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.360" end="01:25:18.719" style="s2">personality like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.960" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">just they&#39;re related but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.719" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">distinct</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.080" end="01:25:27.920" style="s2">yes you see that in buddhism and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.480" end="01:25:30.800" style="s2">the higher yoga</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.920" end="01:25:30.800" style="s2">tantras like</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.960" end="01:25:34.480" style="s2">things like that where they engage with</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:37.679" style="s2">imaginal exercises</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.480" end="01:25:39.520" style="s2">and archetypal imagery very directly</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.679" end="01:25:40.960" style="s2">but you find it in most traditions in</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.520" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">some way or another</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.960" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">all right so one more question thank you</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:46.480" style="s2">all right double question about it</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:46.480" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.159" end="01:25:52.159" style="s2">okay i so one more question zach one</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.480" end="01:25:53.040" style="s2">more question i&#39;ll do it to try to do it</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.159" end="01:25:55.679" style="s2">quick</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.040" end="01:25:56.719" style="s2">all right uh so chris chris eddie had a</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.679" end="01:26:00.800" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.719" end="01:26:02.800" style="s2">chris what&#39;s up how&#39;s it going</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.800" end="01:26:04.159" style="s2">yeah i wanted to ask it could be</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.800" end="01:26:05.840" style="s2">formulated in a few ways but the way i</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.159" end="01:26:07.520" style="s2">wrote it was what are the open questions</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.840" end="01:26:08.880" style="s2">you have about the formulation of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.520" end="01:26:11.840" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.880" end="01:26:12.480" style="s2">both from a theoretical and a practical</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.840" end="01:26:14.239" style="s2">standpoint</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.480" end="01:26:15.600" style="s2">um so what do you feel you need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.239" end="01:26:17.120" style="s2">clarify about it</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.600" end="01:26:19.280" style="s2">you know what kind of images do you have</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.120" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">for it like what do you</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.280" end="01:26:25.920" style="s2">wish it would become things like that</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:27.840" style="s2">thank you chris um</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.920" end="01:26:29.840" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting i think mostly</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.840" end="01:26:31.040" style="s2">what i&#39;m feeling a need for as i speak</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.840" end="01:26:36.960" style="s2">it with you all</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.040" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">is to write about it um because it is uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.960" end="01:26:42.000" style="s2">slippery feels slippery like as i speak</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:43.600" style="s2">about it like i think i&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.000" end="01:26:45.440" style="s2">clarity and i think it&#39;s coming across</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.600" end="01:26:47.679" style="s2">but i also think that</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.440" end="01:26:49.199" style="s2">um there&#39;s a difference between speech</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.679" end="01:26:51.600" style="s2">and text</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.199" end="01:26:52.480" style="s2">so i think putting it into some written</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.600" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.480" end="01:26:58.320" style="s2">will be quite powerful um</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:26:59.280" style="s2">you know most of my open questions have</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.320" end="01:27:01.199" style="s2">to do with</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.280" end="01:27:03.440" style="s2">well there&#39;s two sets there&#39;s the detail</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.199" end="01:27:05.120" style="s2">work which is like i describe like</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.440" end="01:27:07.280" style="s2">okay does this actually work like okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.120" end="01:27:09.520" style="s2">let&#39;s take this psychological model</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.280" end="01:27:11.120" style="s2">see if i can oh i make sense of it great</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.520" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">i can basically run it through some</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.120" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">iterations</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:15.440" style="s2">of application across fields of</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:16.880" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.440" end="01:27:17.760" style="s2">and questions in psychology which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.880" end="01:27:18.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to start doing next</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.760" end="01:27:22.480" style="s2">week with the practicum</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.960" end="01:27:24.159" style="s2">like if we can&#39;t solve basic</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.480" end="01:27:25.760" style="s2">problems staring us in our face that</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.159" end="01:27:28.000" style="s2">have to do with our own psyche</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.760" end="01:27:29.440" style="s2">with the metapsychology then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.000" end="01:27:31.679" style="s2">worth anything so</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.440" end="01:27:32.960" style="s2">it needs to be tested we need to kick</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.679" end="01:27:35.360" style="s2">the tires and</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.960" end="01:27:36.320" style="s2">and really see if it&#39;s going to work as</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.360" end="01:27:39.760" style="s2">an applied</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.320" end="01:27:40.560" style="s2">psychology um and then i&#39;d also like to</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.760" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.560" end="01:27:49.120" style="s2">uh yeah basically</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.440" end="01:27:52.320" style="s2">you know i think for me it&#39;s about what</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.120" end="01:27:55.679" style="s2">actually could work</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.320" end="01:27:58.960" style="s2">in our culture to get</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.679" end="01:28:02.239" style="s2">the mental health crisis uh</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.960" end="01:28:05.440" style="s2">resolved or at least</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.239" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">um stop it from continuing to get worse</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.440" end="01:28:09.199" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s much broader question</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:11.199" style="s2">than my i&#39;m out of psychology i actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.199" end="01:28:13.679" style="s2">have no pretense of thinking i</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.199" end="01:28:15.840" style="s2">that this work will do that but when i</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.679" end="01:28:17.440" style="s2">think about like what&#39;s the vision</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.840" end="01:28:19.199" style="s2">in that is that we need to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.440" end="01:28:24.080" style="s2">some way like</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.199" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">um to stop this cascading</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.080" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.159" end="01:28:34.080" style="s2">um which the psyche is kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.560" end="01:28:35.920" style="s2">embroiled in</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.080" end="01:28:38.960" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like but how do we do that</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.920" end="01:28:40.480" style="s2">well it&#39;s with the psyche oh that sucks</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.960" end="01:28:42.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s like they&#39;re so it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.480" end="01:28:44.800" style="s2">have to find a way to again</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.159" end="01:28:45.600" style="s2">get the psyche to like throw water on</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.800" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">its own face</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.600" end="01:28:49.120" style="s2">or to like look in the mirror somehow so</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">what what does that actually look like</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.120" end="01:28:53.920" style="s2">at a cultural level</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.639" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">um aside from like war uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.920" end="01:28:57.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know and so most of what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:28:59.440" style="s2">doing is</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.040" end="01:29:00.480" style="s2">an attempt to just like fumble in those</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.440" end="01:29:04.080" style="s2">directions</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.480" end="01:29:07.280" style="s2">uh which um</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.080" end="01:29:08.320" style="s2">which hopefully you know the next</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.280" end="01:29:10.960" style="s2">generation will pick</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.320" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">up or this generation will pick up and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.960" end="01:29:15.760" style="s2">experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:18.080" style="s2">um so that that&#39;s a little bit of how i</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.760" end="01:29:18.800" style="s2">of how i see it at this point it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.080" end="01:29:20.800" style="s2">nascent</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.800" end="01:29:22.159" style="s2">there needs to be writing done there</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.800" end="01:29:23.520" style="s2">needs to be application</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.159" end="01:29:25.199" style="s2">thinking about all the things and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.520" end="01:29:26.800" style="s2">there needs to be thinking about you</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.199" end="01:29:30.239" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.800" end="01:29:33.600" style="s2">the broader field of effect that one</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.239" end="01:29:37.280" style="s2">would want to get going</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.600" end="01:29:41.280" style="s2">so cool thank you chris</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.280" end="01:29:44.800" style="s2">um so that&#39;s all she wrote</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.280" end="01:29:47.120" style="s2">same time next week uh we&#39;ll wrap the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.800" end="01:29:48.400" style="s2">transcendent slides and then my</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.120" end="01:29:53.840" style="s2">invitation would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.400" end="01:29:53.840" style="s2">to not bring questions about the model</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.920" end="01:29:57.360" style="s2">you can but bring questions about the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.560" end="01:30:00.960" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.360" end="01:30:02.159" style="s2">that the model could be used to address</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.960" end="01:30:04.400" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll learn more about the</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.159" end="01:30:06.480" style="s2">model as we try to address it</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.400" end="01:30:07.679" style="s2">and the world includes your own neuroses</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.480" end="01:30:09.760" style="s2">and minds</p>
